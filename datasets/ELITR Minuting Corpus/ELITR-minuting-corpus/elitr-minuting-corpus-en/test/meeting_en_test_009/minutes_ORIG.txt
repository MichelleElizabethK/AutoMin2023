--   Streaming of subtitles
-  [PERSON1] failed to stream subtitles from his laptop behind a firewall (“failed to read RTMP packet header...Unknown error”) and from his desktop (“not enough frames to estimate rate; consider increasing probesize...Input/output error”)
-  Can we make [ORGANIZATION2] platform running locally within [ORGANIZATION1] wired network?
-  Without this, the serving NB won't be able to stream through the firewall…
