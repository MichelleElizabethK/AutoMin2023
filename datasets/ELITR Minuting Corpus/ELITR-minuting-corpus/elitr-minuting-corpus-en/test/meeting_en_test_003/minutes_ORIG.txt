Minutes 
•	Pexip: [URL1]
•	PIN: 1234
•	Updates on components:
o	[ORGANIZATION1] presentation platform development schedule
•	The first prototype should be available at June 15.
•	[PROJECT2] would surely like to see a less finished prototype sooner.
o	[PROJECT3] worker
•	Initial steps made. [ORGANIZATION1] worker &lt;-python server-&gt; [PROJECT3] server
•	Python script should take care of pre- and post-processing
•	Handling of partial sentences:
•	[PROJECT2] does not see any difference, assuming that the [PROJECT3] model would be trained to work reasonably well on partial sentences.
•	Handling of timestamps
•	[PERSON8]'s guess is that the [ORGANIZATION1] worker should work well with timestamps and totally hide them from the python and [PROJECT3]
•	The only timestamps that we have are the beginning and end of the sentence/utterance. Is that a problem? ([ORGANIZATION1] should consider this.)
•	[PROJECT2] needs to discuss with [PERSON6] the updates vs. history of text fields.
o	Clones of [ORGANIZATION2] workers to run in [LOCATION1]?
•	[ORGANIZATION3] now provides 16-17 workers
•	To be tested with [ORGANIZATION2] after this call:
•	[URL2]
•	[ORGANIZATION3] will prepare an image and [ORGANIZATION4] will try to get that running
•	This is not very critical for the [PROJECT4] workshop
•	This is more important for [ORGANIZATION2] translated calls.
•	There is no real rush with this image, unless [PERSON3] agrees that a backup site of ASR workers is very sensible thing to have.
o	Data gathering: platform ready, can [PERSON2] start getting the files?
o	ASR worker: the bug
•	sometimes one worker can handle several sessions (one after another) but then it becomes stuck; it remains in available state but does not provide any output
•	[PERSON10] has also seen it, will diagnose it.
•	Please make the bug replicable by using a separate fingerprint, a single worker and stress-test it.
o	Production client
•	Only default parameters, comments and documentation changed
•	We removed windows version, OK?
•	Text-to-text client to run only segmentation, only MT, … please, help! It's the same as in sample, but it didn't return anything ( [URL] )
•	[PERSON6] &amp; [PERSON9] please help PERSON9, PERSON9 will resend the e-mail.
•	Find dates for future meetings
o	Fri 31.5. at 10.00
o	Fri 7.6. at 10.00
o	Fri 14.6. at 10.00
o	Fri 21.6.  at 10.00
o	[PROJECT4]: 26.-27.6.
•	[PERSON6] to support us remotely
•	(too early to Select final ASR and MT models)
