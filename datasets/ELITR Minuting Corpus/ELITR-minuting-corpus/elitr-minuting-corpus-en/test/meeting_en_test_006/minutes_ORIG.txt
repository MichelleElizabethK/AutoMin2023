-- [ORGANIZATION4] Congress -- 
- Demo for [ORGANIZATION6]
-- Can we organise the demo next week or the following one? (May 4-17, they prefer sooner than later).
-- [ORGANIZATION6] doesn't have a preference for the scenario (we can choose what we think is better for an online demo).
-- Feedback for what [PERSON8] sent them:
- there are several guidelines and standards, for example, from BBC [URL]
- better captioning/STT presentation on screen will make better translation and readability. Recomposing the sentence on the fly might affect readability.
- Human interpretation is also delayed a little, as the interpreter listens for chunks of speech before translating.  Listening to a foreign language and having better subtitles with little delay would be already achievement.
