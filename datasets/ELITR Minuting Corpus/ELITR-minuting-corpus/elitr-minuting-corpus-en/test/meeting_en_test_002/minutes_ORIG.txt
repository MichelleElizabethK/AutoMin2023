Meeting 14. 9. 2020:
Attendance: [PERSON6], [PERSON8], [PERSON3], [PERSON5]

-  [PROJECT5]:
--   backtranslation of monolingual data still running (both on GPUs and CPUs) - many people use GPUs these days, so the translation slowed down significantly
--   => cannot make it for [ORGANIZATION6] deadline :(
-  deadline moved to 7th October :)
-  [PROJECT3]:
--   paper for [PROJECT1] accepted
-  camera-ready due 17.9.
-  [PERSON11] is going to read it and check it all this week
--   experiment 2
-  already running by [ORGANIZATION7]
-  the number of participants seems to be critically low, but [PERSON6] should know more
-  [PERSON4] wrote 5 days ago: “I think we have to start a wider campaign of dissemination for this experiment.”
-  [PERSON11]: I know no channels how to disseminate such things (and c'mon, it should've been [ORGANIZATION7]'s responsibility)
-  advert: [URL]
-  [PERSON5] emailed [PERSON12] asking about the [ORGANIZATION7] progress
-  [PROJECT7]:
--   multi-reference testset:
-  ~ 50 sentences
--   possibly a separate weekly meeting?
