(PERSON5) Okay, so [PERSON6] I'm going I I like almost done with the summarization metrics doc.
(PERSON6) Uhm.

So I would require like another session <unintelligible/> then I can give it to you.
Like it's almost done now majority of the metrics.
(PERSON6) Perfect.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
(PERSON5) I <unintelligible/> share it in in a minuting group.

(PERSON6) Yes, yes, yes <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) So ah, ah, this is the update from my end.
And ah, and what tense
And and [PERSON6] I would need your brief <unintelligible/> to put on the proposal.

And then if I f- forgot again.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
(PERSON6) I will <unintelligible/> 
(PERSON5) This the meet <unintelligible/>
Okay,
but that is not urgent, 
because we are eventually meeting on Friday.
So did [PERSON3] agree to meet on Friday?
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) At our coffee hour?
(PERSON6) Uhm did we ask you?
(PERSON5) Yes, I I met him you were there <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Uhm and and what did he say?
(PERSON5) There was no response.
(PERSON6) I think that he is the whole week uhm he has this whole week very, very busy.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON6) I can't he- I can't hear your email.
I can't see you find your email.
I didn't get it.
(PERSON5) I I have sent to the minute group,
you didn't get?
I guess you were subscribed to that group.
(PERSON6) Yes, okay, so it should be there in this case.
Probably-
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> Uhm I know that he responded to tell that he has very, very difficult week this this week 
because of this uhm action uhm <unintelligible/> or something.
(PERSON5) Oh, oh yes.
[PERSON3] asked us to like be there in the demo tomorrow.
(PERSON6) Mhm.
(PERSON5) So it coincides with our coffee hour.
So.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Let us be there tomorrow for some time, 
and then maybe we can back we can be back in our usual meeting.
(PERSON6) Mhm.
Yes, okay.
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON6) I have just written that [PERSON2].
Oh, I wanted to ask you something.
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON6) But-
I contacted my Russian colleagues and she answered-
So one of my colleagues ant- answered that there would be somebody, definitely.
So I will ask for the name probably would would you like the name or the institution?
(PERSON5) Mhm so I asked [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], 
I guess we can get only one submission from this.
(PERSON6) No, I want to ask.
Now, I'm asking, what information about participants do you need.
Uhm the institution?
The name?
(PERSON5) The institution and the participant name that would enough.
(PERSON6) Aha, uhm.
Because-
(PERSON5) And the team- 
Yes.
(PERSON6) Yes. 
(PERSON5) Team members.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> what?
(PERSON5) Affiliation and team members.
(PERSON6) Yes, yes, okay.
(PERSON5) So I got the same from [PERSON9],
but I didn't get it from uhm [PERSON8].
So the thing is now uhm like I suspect [PERSON9] said that they will uhm there will be only a single team from [ORGANIZATION5].
And I I also suspect that there will be one single thing from [ORGANIZATION3].
So uhm and supposedly if we have -
you check right [PERSON1] is living.
(PERSON6) Yes, I have just read it.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
So.
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON6) But does it mean that [PERSON1] is not making his submission?
(PERSON5) I don't know, 
but I think umm maybe not.
(PERSON6) So I I to say the truth.
I would not so I don't know what [PERSON3] thinks on that point.
But if [PERSON1] is working on summarization, 
why wouldn't he make a submission on the shared task?
So actually, I have no pro-
so <unintelligible/> I think you could do that so probably here.
So you why not?
I-
(PERSON5) Okay, let us hope that, 
because [PERSON6]  I'm not really worried about submissions letter,
because we will get submissions.
That is for sure, 
because we will promote this.
But the thing is now we have this in the proposal.
So for the-
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Yeah.
So for the proposal I think like for sure we can assume that we have two from uhm [ORGANIZATION2] and one from [ORGANIZATION5], one from one from [ORGANIZATION3], 
so that makes four.
And then we have maybe one from <unintelligible/> and one from <unintelligible/>.
So we have six, 
six which are definite 
and maybe one from in [PERSON1] institution in Russia.
And I think I can find someone in my institution in India.
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON5) So so I will definitely release to them.
So that would make the count uh eight I guess we are still foresaw.
(PERSON6) Yes, I understand.
(PERSON5)  We are still <unintelligible/>,
but I think we have to make it up somehow.
(PERSON6) Yes, I actually think that probably if you pro- maybe write one more email, 
personal email not to the <unintelligible/> to [PERSON3] that we need <unintelligible/> 
and it seems that we really liking them especially <unintelligible/> 
and that you need help.
He just real promptly react 
and write some emails and and get some names.
I I think that it is it may have some result.
(PERSON5) Okay, okay, so I will do it.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Right now.
(PERSON6) he <unintelligible/> really to help and I told that he to him.
He was immediately ready to do something.
And but he has a lot of other things, 
he just forgot it.
(PERSON5) Yeah, okay, so I will do it right now after this meeting.
(PERSON6) Yes, it can it could help.
Well, why not?
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON6) And probably I will check more and more than one name from Russia, 
so it's not really  when <unintelligible/>.
I will try now.
(PERSON5) Okay, okay, okay.
That would be great.
So we are just <unintelligible/> by four.
I think we can managed uhm it within by the submission deadline.
So I will write it to [PERSON3] right now, 
and I think we can get back to us soon.
(PERSON6) Uhm.
Probably he knows somebody else who makes summarization.
What about [PERSON1] if we can.
So he is not very communicating.
But ah nevertheless, 
he could know people who could want to take part in sh- summarization shared task.
What about asking him?
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah.
I think we can ask.
(PERSON6) Actually he is also in the community.
He is in this summarization community.
He could know somebody.
(PERSON5) Uhhuh. 
Okay, okay, so uh one thing [PERSON6],
the another thing that comes is like I don't know if [PERSON1] is living.
So will he be like be part of the organization team.
I don't know like we have to ask [PERSON3]?
(PERSON6) Aha, yes, this is, we have to ask [PERSON3].
This is I do.
(PERSON5) Okay.
Okay.
(PERSON6) Actually probably not, 
because probably not.
(PERSON5) Hopefully yeah he was not participating.
(PERSON6) Yes, but if we need something, 
he would be really far away.
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Okay.
(PERSON6) Uhm but let us <unintelligible/> [PERSON3].
(PERSON5) I was really surprised with the email.
Uh anyway, it's like uh.
So I have also asked him about the survey paper that we were doing <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON5) like whether he would be willing to continue or no or not.
So after that-
(PERSON6) Well he has prepared something, 
and and he was going to finish with this <unintelligible/> to proceed it and to finish it.
So I I kind of expect that he was uhm,
he wanted to do that.
He wanted-
(PERSON5) Okay, okay, okay, that would be great.
So I will just start paying him and try to know, 
and also I will I will ask from him that if he can-
(PERSON6) Probably he knows somebody.
Yeah, yeah, probably he just for what as somewhere where we could ask.
(PERSON5) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
So I will just write two emails personally to [PERSON1] and [PERSON3].
(PERSON6) Uhm.
Yes separately.
Yes.
(PERSON5) Okay, so uhm that was that was that was it from my side [PERSON6].
I'm-
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON5) I'm  yet to finish,
because there are so many metrics.
And I have to try to actually look at the paper right.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Yes, so no don't worry.
(PERSON5) Sorry.
(PERSON6) May I ask you for one more thing please.
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION4] corpus.
So I have to write the description of our minuting corpus,
so the data we use.
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON6) Uhm I should write I don't know two paragraphs about [ORGANIZATION4].
How we are with that now.
Do you have some numbers?
Or maybe some text already, 
so something about [ORGANIZATION4] that I can submit to the kind of deliver about, 
[PROJECT1] deliver about.
[PERSON4] asks me to uhm.
(PERSON5) Oh okay.
(PERSON6) To fail to to include some data about.
(PERSON5) Yeah, I'll have the numbers [PERSON6] 
and uh I think data already there in our agenda doc
but after cleaning, 
because I didn't really find it <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah uh-huh, 
but it doesn't matter, 
I think we can just say what how we are on that now.
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON6) So just where is it huge I'm looking at it now.
(PERSON5) So, [PERSON6], you can just what do you want from me that uhm like how the data is prepared 
and where are we now without cleaning.
So that is what you request.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, I want from you uh,
well, I can't really create it myself, 
but I don't have numbers.
I want to create some paragraph or tool we are uhm so to get more data we decided to u- to use [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON5) Uhm.
(PERSON6) And data uhm some reference to that,
uhm we have extracted blah, blah, blah something, 
we extract uhm from this side and extracted the minutes from here.
uhm as results we got 9000 uhm <unintelligible/> 9000 meetings.
Not really <unintelligible/> 9000 meetings uhm.
Minutes so minutes are different something like that.
Just kind of- <unintelligible/> about [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON5) So [PERSON6] you can you can yeah you can send me the <unintelligible/> 
and I will put down the uhm. 
(PERSON6) I can send you the link to the [ORGANIZATION1].
Yes, propably it will be better.
(PERSON5) Yes.

And and and <unintelligible/> like something uhm I will just put the numbers 
because <unintelligible/> I'm not really finding any time.
(PERSON6) Yes, I understand that you are over- yes really I totally agree.
<laugh/>
(PERSON5) Uhm, yeah.
So I can definitely help you with that.
If I <unintelligible/>  put the numbers in appropriate places.
I will do that.
Please share <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Yeah.
Just I don't think it's very important.
It's just deliverable that should be uhm finished at the end of I don't know what maybe December.

(PERSON6) I realized that I don't have [ORGANIZATION4] data.
(PERSON5) Yes, please put email todo list or maybe also I have sign me in the todo list

(PERSON5) Yes, I am not finished yet, so.

So I don't think I can share it here.
