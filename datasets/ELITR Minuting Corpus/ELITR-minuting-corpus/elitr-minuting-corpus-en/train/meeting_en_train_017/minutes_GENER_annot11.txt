• [PERSON4] suggests that subtitles should be rather shorter than longer, and all the partners should avoid sending longer messages.
• [PERSON5] refuses option with delay of the text flow
• [PERSON5] mentions the problem with maintaining constant signal quality, it is therefore a possibility to consider sequence of images, such as the slides or streaming

• [PERSON1] was considering, that one of the workshop features, that there will be active subtitling that will have either the slides or live demo.
