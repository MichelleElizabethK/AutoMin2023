[PROJECT5] Internal

Attendees: [PERSON7], [PERSON8], [PERSON9], [PERSON9], [PERSON6], [PERSON4]
Purpose of meeting: discussing project updates: [PROJECT7], [PROJECT9], [PROJECT3].

- Discussing last week's call. 
-- Regarding [PROJECT3]: after consulting [ORGANIZATION1] colleagues, we will be required to provide a prototype for integration. 

- Discussing [PROJECT7]. 
-- Discussing integration.
--- Most probably, the integration for [PROJECT7] has been been done by [ORGANIZATION1] colleagues, though it has not been confirmed, but it was their responsibility.
---- In this pile of integration, only back translation has been implemented. 
--- As far as integration goes, everything should be okay on our part. 
--- We will ask about it on the next call with them, whether they did their part. 
--- [PROJECT3] will not be easy to integrate into [PROJECT7]. 
---- We might deliver it as a separate prototype module for presentation purposes. 
-- Discussing the number of segments needed. 
--- The sufficient number of segments has not yet been estimated. 
-- Discussing the timeline for [PROJECT7]. 
--- Possibly aiming for a November conference ([ORGANIZATION7]), or the next one in January [PROJECT8].
-- Analyzing the data.
--- Possibly, [ORGANIZATION1] colleagues could analyze user experience, how much the user spent on certain stimuli etc. 
--- We could analyze translation quality. 
-- The analysis could be similar to what has been done in the [PROJECT8] paper. 
-- The paper should cover the quality of the three MT systems, compare them and describe how they affect the results. 
-- Getting Czech speakers to evaluate the translation quality will not be difficult, it will be added as another annotation exercise for [ORGANIZATION4] annotators.
-- Estonians are very cooperative, so hopefully there also will not be a problem with getting Estonian evaluators.

- Discussing [PROJECT9].
-- Comparing the system using back translation and the system using paraphrases. 
--- When using no monolingual data, the system using paraphrases works better than the system using back translation.
--- Will explore how it changes when the amount of monolingual data increases or decreases. 
-- Before, the main motivation was to have Czech to English system, which is good for the outbound set up. 
--- The motivation has changed since the augmentation system (using paraphrases for data augmentation in standard machine translation) appeared to be more promising that the [PROJECT9] system. 

- Discussing [PROJECT3]. 
-- Currently training an English-Czech module using Fairseq. 
-- Going to use data sets with many references. 
-- Currently thinking about how to select the constraints - for example, informative words.  
-- It is necessary to have a fixed set of references for a given comparison. 
-- Will probably use positive constraints instead of negative constraints.
--- Will get the positive constraints from the references: if the reference has it, then it is a good word to use. 
-- Manual evaluation will be necessary as well. 
-- We can also measure how many constraints are necessary to reach the reference we want.
