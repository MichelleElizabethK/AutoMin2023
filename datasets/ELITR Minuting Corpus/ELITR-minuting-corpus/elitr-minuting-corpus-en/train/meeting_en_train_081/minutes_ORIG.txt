[URL1]

Call on March 4, 2019 at 10.00
Platform: 
? [URL3]
? PIN: 1234
? The above room is already active and [PROJECT1] is there. Please test it.
? For general tests at any time (that you can connect and that your speech gets through), use this testing room: [URL]
? 10-12 AM CET
- Participants: [PERSON4]; [PERSON21]; [PERSON20]; [PERSON15]; [PERSON8]; [PERSON14]; [PERSON12]; [PERSON2]; [PERSON9]; [PERSON17] 

Agenda:
? [ORGANIZATION5]: [PROJECT1].[ORGANIZATION5].com
? [PERSON21] does not really use [ORGANIZATION5], [ORGANIZATION5] is not any more reliable than e-mail, so always ask people for confirmation of receipt.
? [URL] -- very brief demo
? What is the “API”? What are registered services?
? Physical layout: (what we need to cover)
? Main stage:
? subtitling (ASR+MT)
? videomixing of subtitles and presentations
? Recording
? to have SLT data for later use
? Secondary stage 
? subtitling (ASR+MT) … if we get a second videomixer
? Recording
? All talks -- to have SLT data for later
? Clearest Voice competition (aka “90s in a lift”) => separate files one per competitor are needed (manual segmentation at the secondary stage)
? Transcription space
? Manual transcriptions for the Clearest Voice competition
? WER evaluation
? Offline presentation booth
? Roll-up? (TODO)
? Robot Nao? (TODO)
? Etc. TODO
? Wiring (Network, audio, video):
? Still in negotiation, we need to specify what we need.
? Main stage:
? We expect to connect [ORGANIZATION4]'s male XLR connector ([URL]) to the mixing device to get sound.
? Confirmed by [ORGANIZATION4].
? We expect to provide [ORGANIZATION2]'s? head sets to the speakers?
? Confirmed by [ORGANIZATION4], [ORGANIZATION4] will suggest some headsets, [PERSON2] will negotiate their connection with Antre
? Which to buy? [URL] (professional wireless handheld mic, could not find head sets)
- Does require adapter cable to connect
? preferably at [ORGANIZATION8] ([PERSON15] will send)
? How many: 2 for this stage should be fine; 1 would make it time-critical
? We expect to get Antre's male VGA connector AND/OR their male HDMI connector to plug to [ORGANIZATION1]'s Epiphan female VGA and female HDMI.
? [ORGANIZATION1] has so far used only DVI
? In theory it should also support VGA, but it needs to be tested. [PERSON15] will test. [PERSON2] will ask Antre which they provide.
? We expect [ORGANIZATION1]'s separate videomixing notebook to offer both VGA and HDMI for Antre's overhead projector to present slides+subtitles.
? Ethernet male cable will be provided by Antre.
? WHAT OVERALL BANDWIDTH to the Internet do we need?
- upstream is critical! With 1Mbit upstream we should be safe.
- it has to be reliable!
? Firewall setting overall! (Mediator uses specific ports.)
? Double check with Antre the IP configuration (DHCP/static addresses…)
? On the 19 March, in the morning, Antre will install the wires; we are allowed to come after 14.00 in the afternoon.
? The fair starts on 20 March in the afternoon.
? 2 NBs provided by [ORGANIZATION1], both need wired connection
? Secondary stage:
? We expect [ORGANIZATION1]'s male XLR connector to connect to the mixing device.
? We expect to provide [ORGANIZATION2]'s head sets to the speakers
? How many: 4-5 for this stage.
- 2x2 needed, 1 for backup
? We count on having only one channel and saying that ASR fails with two people speaking at the same time.
? Situation with videomixing unclear. We don't have a second Epiphan, see below.
? Notebooks:
? Audio recordings: [ORGANIZATION1] should have one more, but [ORGANIZATION2] should have a backup. (For the recording client: Linux or Mac; for the subtitles anything with Web)
? Videomixing was done on Windows only so far (Mac tried once).
? Ethernet male cable will be provided by Antre.
? Transcription space:
? Very likely no ethernet, only Antre's wifi (risk of cramped wifi channels by other participants!)
? Offline presentation booth:
? power socket provided by Antre?
? No ethernet, no wifi assumed.
? HW Setup:
? New videomixer
? [ORGANIZATION2] needs to know from [ORGANIZATION1] *now*, if any of the used devices on eBay are the ones we should buy, or if there are any alternative devices. Possible links [PERSON21] found so far:
? [URL]
? [URL]
? [URL2]
? After getting this second device, [ORGANIZATION2] will need support from [ORGANIZATION1] to get the second videomixer running (so the installation, scripts etc.). Who from [ORGANIZATION1] can help us with this?
? [PERSON15] can help [ORGANIZATION2], once we have the epiphan.
? Nao part -- [PERSON8] is asking a colleague, what's the current status?
? [PERSON9] has some experience; robots have bad TTS, [ORGANIZATION7] TTS in much better.
? [PERSON9] recommends to avoid bad TTS, rather scratch the idea altogether.
? Software Setup:
? Initial plan of SW components -- see image below 
? Is it feasible? Is there a correct distinguishing between clients and workers? (E.g. The “en subtitling recorder” must be a worker, not a client, right? Because clients can not only receive.)
? Some streams must be connected to several components, e.g. en-speech goes to ASR and Clearest voice audio segmenter. Does it need to be sent through the network to Mediator twice? Is it possible to optimalize it?
? Clearest Voice -- Record & Cut & Label & Save samples tool:
? [PERSON10]'s help appreciated (we have to sync about it)
? How to connect it to audio? Rather directly through a mixing pult, or through Mediator? (preferred)
? New idea: save the exact time stamp of beginning and end
? Feedback: “save everything” must be a worker
? Dresscode ([PERSON2]'s suggestion: -- black trousers, white shirt, blue bowtie, blue suspenders (she will buy the bowties and suspenders)
? Basic MT support:
? {en, cs} -> {de, en, cs} 
? What's the status of MT components?
? Extended MT support (very optional):
? The numbers of fair participating companies by countries/languages (corresponds to number of participants):
? 52 cs + 3 sk, 19 de-AT, 19 it, 13 Belgium (= Dutch + French, probably), 7 ro, 4 es, 3 ru, 3 Bulgarian, 1 Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French, German, probably)
? => languages by priority: 1. EN, 2. CS, 3.-4. IT ([ORGANIZATION1]), DE-AT, 5. FR-BE+FR-LUX ([ORGANIZATION1]), 6. NL-BE, 7. RO, 8. ES ([ORGANIZATION1]), 9.-10. RU, BG, 11. SK, (12. LUX, Catalan, Basque...)
