[PROJECT1] remote meeting
Agenda for Mon, 16 Mar, 10 AM CET
- Connection
-- [ORGANIZATION2]:
-   [URL1]
-   The PIN is 1234
--   ([ORGANIZATION5] is switched to [ORGANIZATION9] ASR and as such it does not record; also, we lost the previous recording because [ORGANIZATION5] keeps it only for 30 days)
--   [ORGANIZATION5] could be used as the second option if [ORGANIZATION2] fails/is too overloaded.
-   There is a non-public linux version of [ORGANIZATION5] client.
-   Financial table
--   Will be needed for the review (also good for us as a summary)
--   2 sheets in Excel
-   Use of resources - more detailed: Personnel costs, Other direct costs (travel, equipment)
-   Report form C - the overview table, which you have in GA
--   To whom should I send it for filling out?
-   [ORGANIZATION1] - [PERSON3]
-   [ORGANIZATION13] - [PERSON10]
-   [ORGANIZATION4] - [PERSON15] (put [PERSON9] in CC)
-   [ORGANIZATION5] - [PERSON19]
-   IWSLT preparations:
--   Is mp3 OK as input files, or would ASR people frown too much?
-   [ORGANIZATION4]: WAV 16KHz
-   Consider: flac1 -- not lossy
-   IWSLT Joint submission
--   [PERSON12]+[PERSON13] get ready today+tomorrow
--   First full run on Wednesday
--   then improved versions
--   Logdirs need to record detailed versions of each component.
-   Our other IWSLT submissions?
--   Maybe [PERSON7] ([ORGANIZATION14]) en->cs only
--   no [ORGANIZATION13], no [ORGANIZATION1]
--   ...but still please ask around, outside of [PROJECT1]
-   Upcoming deliverables plan
--   include papers
-   those on arxiv are easy to include -- this is esp. the way to go for [PROJECT2] submissions: make sure to put them on arxiv before the anonymity period, during the anonymity period, include their arxiv versions to the deliverable
-   those without arxiv and under review deserve a delay in deliverable publication (not deliverable submission; the deliverable has to be submitted to the EC at the original deadline).
-   [ORGANIZATION14] is checking with [PERSON2] if the publication can be delayed
-   those published are ideal
--   ask [PERSON2] for a later publication of the deliverable
--   create and distribute overleaf links
