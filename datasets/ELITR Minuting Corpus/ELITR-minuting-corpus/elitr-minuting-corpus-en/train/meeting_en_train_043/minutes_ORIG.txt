o [PERSON9]:
• concern about constrained vs. non-strained
• by tonight, raw ASR outputs should be ready

• [PERSON16]: [PERSON12] should contact [PERSON18] to double check who has an agreement finished and is waiting for work.; [PERSON12] should start contacting each of the validators
o Collected/downloaded corona parallel corpus (directory structure is mentioned in SL Dataset) from [ORGANIZATION3].
o To do list:
o Polishing 21 [ORGANIZATION2] test sets before uploading Github
o Write my information in the readme
o crawl Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin mono data corpus & prepare test sets for the rest of the languages.

• [PERSON16] will promise the demo to [PERSON2] around April 23
• [PERSON4] should warn if deployment by Apr 18 would be at risk
