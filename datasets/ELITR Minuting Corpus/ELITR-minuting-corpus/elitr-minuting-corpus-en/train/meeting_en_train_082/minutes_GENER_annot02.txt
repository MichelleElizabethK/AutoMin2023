Purpose of meeting: Evaluation of latency.

Summary of meeting:


[PERSON4]
- had problem with connection and couldn't fully join the discussion, but heard that.

[PERSON8], [PERSON7], [PERSON4], [PERSON3]
- discuss evaluation of latency.
- The paper was little bit confusing in terms of their evaluation, there are several different input and output variables.
- BIOS beam research is quite useful, it stops the output from flickering, but it needs a bit more testing.
- Main difference between the way we approach things and papers approach things, is that we have really ASR with time stamps in milliseconds and not words.
- Explain details and current strategy about time stamps.
- Important is measure of delay between words.
- To introduce the alignment is one of the strategies that it would be aligned segment to segment, and another option consider to have like a maybe sliding window or an adjacent windows.
- Consider putting wrapper around the ASR system, which would have its time monitoring and then emit an extra full stop.
- Discuss data set from [ORGANIZATION7] and other work with that.
- Deadline is on 17th March.
- Evaluation asset is implemented, but it has not been tested yet.
- [PERSON3] will send created ASR output to [PERSON8].
