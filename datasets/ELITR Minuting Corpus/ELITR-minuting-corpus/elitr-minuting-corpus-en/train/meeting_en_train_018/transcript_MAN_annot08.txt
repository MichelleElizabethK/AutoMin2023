(PERSON1) Hello.
(PERSON2) Hi.
Hi <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) I think it is it is geting recorded, wau.
But <unintelligible/> on the cloud?
(PERSON2) Yeah.
Yeah on the cloud.
[PERSON6] mentioned in.
Saturday one half you know uhm I reply to [PERSON6] and he was reply <unintelligible/> 
<unintelligible/> 
Hi [PERSON3].
(PERSON1) Hi [PERSON3].
(PERSON3) Hi [PERSON2], hi everybody.
Where is-
(PERSON2) [PERSON4], <unintelligible/> results of <unintelligible/> today with us.
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Hi, [PERSON5].
I'm just I can't see [PERSON4].
(PERSON2) Yeah, [PERSON4] is not there.
Did he saw the message that we are postponing it? 
(PERSON3) I don't know.
He didn't react.
Where are we, 
where is the link?
<unintelligible/> yeah.
(PERSON2) Do you as active today?
He did <unintelligible/> message.
We had a conversation with him regarding the greatest <unintelligible/>
You are doing?
So.
(PERSON3) With whom?
(PERSON2) With [PERSON4].
(PERSON3) Uhm.
Well.
I need [PERSON4] for to discuss evaluations variations.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes.
(PERSON3) Before he comes we can discuss oth- other topics.
Maybe <unintelligible/> [PERSON1]?
Those whit proposal or something.
(PERSON1) Ah, ah.
Yeah, I ought to dicuss about the proposal.
(PERSON3) And mabye just <unintelligible/> [PERSON5] is here.
(PERSON2) [PERSON5] is here.
(PERSON1) Yeah.
[PERSON5] is here.
Yeah.
(PERSON2) He renounced join.
(PERSON3) Okay. 
Well.
It's good.
When uhm as [PERSON4] join I propose to start with uhm a variations.
Uhm can you hear me everybody, yeah.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) And [PERSON4], [PERSON1] and [PERSON2] do you do you have ready the evaluations in some form?
(PERSON1) Yeah, I have made my comment for the different meeting.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON1) So we can discuss <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Uhm, how d- yeah I also I also proposed to discuss them one by one probably, 
and they want to-
I want to hear from you.
So I also have made my evaluations somehow.
And uhm could we discuss then really one by one so some notes-
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON3) One of them.
Uhm the first one I think we should start with [PERSON2] because this is yours.
(PERSON1) Minute one?
(PERSON3) The first. 
A minute one, yes.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON1) Okay, so.
(PERSON2) We just opened 
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> this?
Minute one I-
(PERSON3) You.
(PERSON1) Yeah. 
I think I <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yes.
I think this is <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> [PERSON1].
<laugh/>
There are a lot of saying see which <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so.
Uhm.
(PERSON1) Okay. 
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) So I need to uhm get my <unintelligible/> with <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON1) Yes.
(PERSON2) So.
When <unintelligible/> annotator I feel like that uhm it is actually a a lot of points, 
which I actually uhm they I'm not able to get the agenda.
Like what is exactly the the agenda regarding the conversation.
All the conversation are being mixed.
So it it is more than a minute.
It is it is actually uhm like pointing the like uhm jotting down the conversation.
So this is what I had a I don't know whether you would like to know.
But that-
(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON2) It is actually having all the topics all the information is captured good.
And so I also made a mistake so when I was to making the minutes.
So.
So I I was just wondering the humans are also making mistakes in making the minutes.
So how <unintelligible/> the machines we able to.
So it it is actually really difficult task.
(PERSON3) So you find.
Uhm so you uhm miss some uhm contents of the conversations?
But you think that-
(PERSON2) Uhm.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> that information is captured?
Do you have any other notes?
(PERSON2) Ah, yes.
So as I mentioned that I'm not-
(PERSON1) I no, 
I don't think -
I don't think [PERSON2] say that.
[PERSON2].
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON1) I think [PERSON2] said that the agenda is not early like it is not clearly understandable.
But I think I <unintelligible/> [PERSON2] you mentioned that it covered all the topics.
Okay?
(PERSON2) Yeah.
It covered all the topics and everything <unintelligible/> details as mentioned,
but uhm it is seeming less than a minute it is seeming to we <unintelligible/> at points to me.
So aga- the grammatically this correct all the points are grammatically correct
and there is not seeming to be coherence into it.
And uhm so this is what I evaluated this minutes the topics <unintelligible/> mentioned it is readable, and there is also much relevance enjoy it.
(PERSON3) Uhm, mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) So and <unintelligible/> all the information is captured.
But it is- the agenda is the the thing which I found here was that the agenda is not here to me did,
because it's all jumbled,
because uhm we- you nee- it needs to be like who sometimes there talking something, and then they change the topic.
So it needs to be like uhm the the topics should be <unintelligible/>.
So it is less understandable the agenda <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah,
uhm.
(PERSON1) So, uhm, so uhm [PERSON2] can I say that uhm this is this is maybe due to the minutes is not grouped into topic.
(PERSON2) Yes.
Yeah.
(PERSON1) For easier follow up like
and minutes mostly followed the linia structure of the of the transcript.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON1) And and the minute was focused to <unintelligible/> note the action point for each topic.
(PERSON2) Yes, you are correct. 
Definitely.
So I actually, when we see what is it purpose of minuting.
It is uhm after you see, after one month, you should get okay what was discussed in the meeting, right?
And wh- what was discussed in we you should know what is supposed to be done.
That is the real purpose of minute.
So when we see when we evaluate by having that <unintelligible/> usualling to a mind.
Ah so we should we should.
It should be something usable tool plus.
It should make that focus on.
So I had this vision in my mind, 
when I was evaluating all the minutes.
(PERSON1) Okay.
So one thing I would like to know from [PERSON3],
so [PERSON3] <unintelligible/> so uhm the minute is done by someone uhm in a in a in a re- in a real time <unintelligible/>, right?
And do you <unintelligible/> that once the minute has been jotted down by a system or by a human,
they should work on it to do to maintain or to group the minutes into topic?
(PERSON3) Uhm.
Well, it's actually hard for me to answered.
Uhm I don't think that need.
So it should be kind of clear and understandable.
And if it is uhm
group into topics you mean uhm ta- from the point of view.
(PERSON1) Of agenda.
Yeah.
It's on agenda.
(PERSON2) I think we are also doing it into automatically also,
because we are we are involving topic [PROJECT1] <unintelligible/> in to <unintelligible/>.
So I think it is supposed to be done or not?
<other_noise/>
(PERSON3) I can not say that they are not really grouped.
So the annotators they not how <unintelligible/> .
Uhm so from my point of view this minute zero one reflect the flow of the meeting.
And when I'm annotated the correspondence the alignment using [PERSON5]'s tool,
when I aligned
(PERSON2) Uhm.
(PERSON3) these minute for  <unintelligible/> the transkript,
these worlds probably the most easy.
(PERSON2) Yes.
UHm.
(PERSON3) Connect them to the <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes.
That is <unintelligible/>.
Uhm.
(PERSON3) It's it really kind of follows.
So it's it has different graphical structure, 
but it is it follows the topics that are.
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON3) That have been discussed.
(PERSON2) Uhm.
(PERSON3) So it is there are not kind of there are not kind of <unintelligible/>.
So there is not set that uhm <unintelligible/> presentations double point something, something, something.
That's uhm from this point it is not graphical organized, 
but from the point of view of time
and from the point of view of how much of information is included.
I would say that it has this agenda structure.
So it-
(PERSON2) Uhm.
(PERSON1) Yes, so I must <unintelligible/> to [PERSON3] like why doing the <unintelligible/> of minutes.
One of the <unintelligible/> is also the alignment thing that we were thinking.
So.
(PERSON3) Uhm. So you are thinking-
(PERSON1) Yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> we could said that was my implicit <unintelligible/> that was my implicit <unintelligible/> to <unintelligible/> annotation tools.
Uhm to make it easier for the annotators to <unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) So.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yeah, well.
Maybe.
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) So this is this is actually a very good example to work for alignment <unintelligible/> this uhm this minute.
(PERSON3) Lets maybe move to [PERSON4].
[PERSON4], could you give your evaluation for these minutes.
(PERSON4) Actually I haven't done an evaluation.
I don't follow how do you perceive the evaluation.
Do you have a protocol? 
(PERSON3) No, so so you didn't do it in this way we stop it now,
and we do it the next day.
So I really asked you very uhm ha- hardly and many times to do the evaluations according to your-
it's not according to protocol,
but according to uhm your ideas.
So read each minutes very attentively 
and mark the notes and give your evaluation from different points from.
You make use of protocol.
You may use the uhm evaluation uhm points that you created that [PERSON2] supplied,
that you find anywhere else, 
but also your logical sense.
And what you consider to be good minutes,
why you consider compare of them and-
so really make formal evaluation based on different points of view, 
you find and not not point of view that I say.
So this was the idea.
(PERSON4) What's the point of this?
And what's the point of this.
(PERSON3) Doesn't matter.
It was not really does but it would discuss many times already.
So the point of this is it that that we everybody of us understand the how we evaluate the meetings. 
Not from the literature, 
but we understand how minutes work.
And how minutes are created,
what are real problems when minutes are created.
And uhm comparing different minutes created by different humans, 
which are in the topic, 
which are not in the topic.
So it's really the work that should be down by you 
and retaerly needs a lot of time from you to compare all the minutes, 
and you didn't do do that.
Re- kindly ask you to do that till I don't know.
Fri- Friday not,
so well okay.
We have to postpone it.
If you don't have these evaluation.
(PERSON4) But at list do we have the transcripts,
where are the transcripts?
The transcripts are the one-
(PERSON3) I have sent,
I have sent the trancript if one, 
the minute- so the meeting is the same as you did your minutes.
So this is these are a- a nine minutes for the same transcript.
I have sent the transcript and and the audio and the audio was incorrect as you told an- and I sent another audio.
The <unintelligible/> one.
So so they correct-
(PERSON4) Okay, so can you please resend the whole pack again, 
like the trancript <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) all the summarize once again.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) So that we know what we are talking about.
(PERSON3) I thought we already knew what we are talking about.
But well.
It's a pitty that you that hav- don't have it.
Anyway.
I will send it again, 
and we we will have to postpone it, 
and if we are already on that point I would re- I would say that actually it's a good way that we if you follow one by one.
And say our notes to that anyway so it could be written, 
it could be really used some evaluations.
When I did evaluations I kind of uhm changed the list of uhm evaluation measures.
And addicted them to these concrete evaluation.
And from these results I see that it will be changed many more times before we evaluate <unintelligible/> meetings as we told yesterday with [PERSON6].
(PERSON4) Okay, so please send us the whole folder again.
And I will try to come up with some suggestions, 
or I don't know.
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
So I really want that you,
I uhm I see all of the meetings,
read all of the meetings 
and think about think about them.
(PERSON4) Yes, so there are all about the same transcript, 
right?
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON4) Only one transcript and some five for to ten summarize.
Okay.
(PERSON3) Nine.
Nine.
(PERSON4) Okay, so please send send a whole pack again, 
and I will do it.
(PERSON3) Okay.
Uhm then lets do it on Monday?
Really.
(PERSON4) No I can I can do it in one  <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> since please have-
(PERSON3) To- tomorrow.
I do you want to do it tomorrow?
(PERSON4) Yes, sure.
No problem.
(PERSON6) What is at what time?
At what time because I want I join this call exactly for the purpose of this discussion uh of everybody's uhm meeting summaries,
and also everybody's evaluation of that.
So at what time would it be happening tomorrow?
Uh, at one?
(PERSON3) Yes.
No.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> we normally have the call <unintelligible/> one.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
So one is good for me.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON6) So yeah, 
lets lets-
(PERSON3) So tomorrow at one,
and actually [PERSON4] you already have the transcripts <unintelligible/>
I will send you the transcript and the audio again.
If you one to have it. 
(PERSON4) We send the whole package transkript of your <unintelligible/> summarize.
(PERSON3) Okay.
Uhm.
(PERSON4) In a zipped folder.
(PERSON3) Okay, not in a zip folder.
<unintelligible/> to audio.
(PERSON1) So I have a question for [PERSON6] <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON1) So uhm so <unintelligible/> how would we like <unintelligible/> the minutes.
So it should be life <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Well, did.
This online aspect is not that critical.
Uhm so sorry about the delay they still like it's quite far too <unintelligible/> place 
<laugh/>
So so the I I always when I talk about it within the project internally,
then I always presented as life summarization of the of the meetings, 
but it's not written anywhere in the proposal.
So the prop- like the the requirement wha- what we promised is just to do summarization.
So.
I think it's better to have it life, 
because it's like flexible, 
and you immediately see whether it makes sense or not.
And it's also more in line with the minuting demonstrator with the wizard of <unintelligible/> that's  discussed separately, like outside of the order teem.
It's uhm it's with [ORGANIZATION1] that you have heard about it.
Uh, in in the bigger calls.
So it's practically it is better to have it as live thing, 
online thing, 
but this is not promised.
So we can always resort to the offline processing,
and that is in line with the with the shared task.
So the shared task,
if you are asking about the shared task the shared task is offline.
(PERSON1) Okay, so on this on my question <unintelligible/> like when we do minuting,
so we follow the transcript 
and we continuously jot down the important points.
That uhm that summarizes the meeting.
So in that <unintelligible/> uhm like having a very structured minute based on some topic in a life scenario <unintelligible/> humans is not possible unless we do second part of word the minutes that we have jonted down
and then we group the point according to the topic.
So unless <unintelligible/> scenario.
What would you suggest.
That if should follow the linia structure of the transkript
or it should be grouped according to the topic, 
or I didn't just think.
(PERSON6) Well, I it should be grouped according to the agenda,
so that is the ideal,
that that is the short answer,
because we have specified the tasks as uhm there is this agenda.
There is this meeting, 
which is possibly still running, 
or it has been already finished 
and populate the agenda with notes from  the meeting, 
and whatever is not for seen in the agenda then yes that should be edit uhm topic wise at the end of the agenda or something like that.
So this is the assignment is extremely flexible in this respect, 
and we can limited in anyway we like, 
uhm so that it is easier for us to develop it.
Uh, it's for the shared task I don't think that we we should give the participants any uh any requirements on what they should do.
I think they are free to do use to to like, uh, organize a topic wise, 
or uh or based on when the topic was introduce it's it's up to them.
And then it's up to our evaluation measure to see,
which of them come sound better 
and how how do we compare these difficult to compare things, 
but it's I I do this on purpose.
I I think that it would not be realistic to simplified too much.
I think it's it's better to work on and on a procedure for manual evaluation of meetings that can accommodate many different styles of these hierarchical meetings.
That already alone is is uhm some narrowing down of of the task.
We want the minutes to be hierarchical.
So I hope that I've answered your your question sufficiently.
So if the the way you can think about this is that we could easily achieve the online behavior using an offline tool by repeatedly running it, 
and like always restarting it,
always creating the the the minutes so far from scratch.
(PERSON1) Uhm.
Okay.
Okay, so [PERSON3] so could we like <unintelligible/>  started with this minute.
So could we like uhm <unintelligible/> consencus about what was the like advantage and what was the negative point of this minutes.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) I think we will come to this consensus tomorrow after discuss it.
Not now.
It's really don't want to postulate the rules.
The idea was that you create the rules at your best understanding of the idea.
And then we can very different approaches, 
and come through what uhm what is better,
was- so what better it's lost the situation,
because because it also happens that people do not full of <unintelligible/>, 
also happend it,
they get back to that point and agenda the beginning.
So there are a lot of different various possibilities.
And lets just judge to our best understanding of the minutes,
discuss it tomorrow 
and then possibly we will have some back what is better what is worse.
(PERSON6) I totally agree with that approach.
Is is it is a brainstorming, 
and it would be spoiled, if someone of you had the opinions from others before doing that tasks himself.
(PERSON1) Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So we yeah yeah so for grouping the minutes into topic like or rather <unintelligible/> agenda, 
because many of times what happend during the during actual meeting is that some topics were <unintelligible/> int the beginning and then <unintelligible/> and then again if if <unintelligible/> point.
Yeah,
so uhm if we follow a linia structure the fast meeting minute that we just <unintelligible/> would fill in that it,
becuase it just follow one of the linia <unintelligible/> there in the transkript.
But uhm yeah so <unintelligible/> if we want like,
because this is a this is a point to merge agenda with the minutes.
So yeah, so
I I deal minuting system should like <unintelligible/> the agenda even if the even if the like discussion <unintelligible/> many time <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, exactly.
So this is if I would be taking the minutes myself,
I would look up the closes matching topic in the agenda.
And I would then within that topic have these separate parts.
And if they would contribute to the same subtopic than I would again merge them further.
So I would I would merge it to the to the topic structure.
But it's also acceptable to to do like according to the <unintelligible/> structure.
And even mix it's possible that for some topics you do it topic wise and for some topics you, you do it only sequentially.
So this all is this this is something this is one more aspect of the of the minutes, 
we could say whether the minutes are fragmented or not.
So this is some level of uhm like coh- maybe have touched upon this with the label coherence, 
but another label that could be this measuring the same thing or slightly different thing would be the fragmentation.
So.
This is again another dimension in which uh the meeting summarize different.
(PERSON1) Yeh, so one one <unintelligible/> I think that is coming up this like I'm also [PERSON3] <unintelligible/> earlier.
Through coherence is something which is not very prominent <unintelligible/> minutes.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON2) But we saw an example of coherence.
[PERSON3] and I saw an example of coherence <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) And especially incoherence, right?
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) No, I yeah co- really the <unintelligible/> coherence is now a little bit used and more senses.
So originally coherence is the actual coherence.
And if this is the <unintelligible/> relations between sentences themselves.
So minutes are selfdomly coherent mostly they are written as kind of a bullet points.
But in our examples,
in our nine minutes,
we have one coherent minute minutes, 
and they are written by [PERSON4].
When the these are actually not really minutes by kind of summary in a paragraph form.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
But that is the coherence-
(PERSON4) I <unintelligible/> sure about it.
I I really.
I have a very strong disagreement about with [PERSON3] <unintelligible/> this respect those.
I don't know where she found is the creation of minutes and summarize.
But.
(PERSON6) It's our own.
<laugh/>
(PERSON4) Oh, it's your own.
Okay.
So I I'm big have been conducting <unintelligible/> in the past month.
And I don't see a singles sta- singles <unintelligible/> to distances <unintelligible/> and the logical and chronological coherence of the of this bullet points of this uhm of this and discourse action that I that I call this <unintelligible/> summarize.
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
Yeah. 
So this is the empty space that we have to fill and get cited for.
(PERSON1) So in the literature literature is completely different,
i i it's going <unintelligible/> direction.
(PERSON3) But [PERSON4], 
I have referred you to our people where there are a lot of reference the system how to write minutes
and they are bullet points they are structured.
So look at our paper written for.
(PERSON6) The citations.
(PERSON3) Yes citations there.
(PERSON4) Your paper is actually our the paper it's mostly written by <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3)  Yes, yes.
(PERSON4) remember that paraphrases of that paper are exactly the <unintelligible/> I'm talking about right now.
The <unintelligible/>  is that we are considering the literature, so.
(PERSON3) No, your your part is about summarization
and my part is about how minutes look like.
Your part <unintelligible/> text sumarizations 
and my part was practically what our minutes and how they look like. 
And there I have a lot of references to what our minutes.
(PERSON4) Not please <unintelligible/> us with references,
because you have a folder in the <unintelligible/> we have a folder in the <unintelligible/> [PROJECT1] folder with-
(PERSON6) But you can acces that yourself.
[PERSON4], you you know.
(PERSON4) This this <unintelligible/> paper there 
and we will <unintelligible/> them a
and I will see if there are relevant or <unintelligible/>.
Maybe-
(PERSON3) No it's not relevant for literature review <unintelligible/> reall when for reality.
So people who write minutes write them in mostly in the structured way.
So when you when we just select when we look at what people summarize
and ma- how the agenda look like not involved in this research literature of how summarize are made <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Okay, so please <unintelligible/> paper <unintelligible/> to its.
What this paper <unintelligible/> and we will check <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) No I'm sorry, [PERSON4].
Find that paper, 
and there is a waste of literature there.
And the list of references there
and find them and look at that <unintelligible/>
because <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Yes, it's it's many cases, 
in many cases it is not proper scientific papers with-
(PERSON3) They are not scientific papers.
Yeah.
(PERSON6) Yeah, the- these are like guidelines that appeared on the web, 
or there in text books, 
but where we don't have the PDF 
and [PERSON3] was probably browsing that text book in library and and so on.
So.
(PERSON4) Okay,
then I guess not serious <unintelligible/>.
I don't want waste time.
(PERSON3) They are not serious, 
they are not about <unintelligible/>.
This is not-
(PERSON6) They are not they are not-
(PERSON3) This is are just rules, how to make minute,
the- they are not supposed to be scientific.
<unintelligible/> never scientific this is just practical guidelines how to create minutes.
They have nothing to do with science.
But-
(PERSON4) Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(PERSON3) Practical input we want with this input than this input is created according to that guide- those guidelines.
<unintelligible/> like- <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Okay. 
(PERSON3) This is a reality this 
and we are make science out of that,
but we have kind of real material.
And this real material is not structured.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON3) And it's not coherent.
Sorry.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
So it's like two different worlds that have never work together, 
and we are putting them together.
So I that's that's the clear reason why there is so much tension.
It's just that we need to accept that the world doesn't behave according to the summaries, according to the uhm to the papers about summarization.
And we are trying to to create the missing papers about the real world.
(PERSON1) I really like this idea.
<laugh/>
Yes.
So  I really like this idea of because like we I also believe that data should be challenging.
And then if we like if we work on the data that is already <unintelligible/> of the <unintelligible/> we that was <unintelligible/> problem.
(PERSON6) Yeah, okay.
Well uhm I have many other things to do.
And since the the main topic of today was postponed for tomorrow.
Then if you don't have anything  for me directly than I would hapily disconect 
and work on the other things.
(PERSON2) Ou, 
[PERSON6] I wanted to you mentioned please that to you mentioned earlier for vizualization for the <unintelligible/>. 
I lost it.
I <unintelligible/> but I lost it.
(PERSON6) What was there were I can't remember what exactly was it.
What type of diagrams was it?
I I don't remember.
(PERSON2) The block diagrams in our presentation for modul <unintelligible/> minuting model.
For you suggested some-
(PERSON6) Well Inkscape.
(PERSON2) Some dot eu I think.
(PERSON6) Oh, I know.
Inkscape.
(PERSON2) Inkscape?
(PERSON3) Inkscape.
(PERSON6) I definitely I definitely prefer.
Yeah.
Inkscape.
(PERSON2) Okay, okay, okay.
Thank you very much.
(PERSON6) So it's a it's a plane uhm vector editor, 
like of an advanced one, 
but a good one.
It creates as <unintelligible/> and PDF files.
And you can directly directly include these PDFs,
so they are skellets vector graphic sentence much better for for publication.
So Inkscape that's.
(PERSON2) Okay. 
Thank you very much.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
Okay.
I I know made all of you <unintelligible/>
so all of you can present,
this meeting will last very likely there is no time limit on that.
But I need to make someone the substitute host when I'm leaving now.
So.
(PERSON3) Have you been from the very beginning?
So I think but-
(PERSON6) No.
You started without me,
but you didn't have a chance to share screen.
So that's the drawback.
If I'm not here-
(PERSON3) Aha.
(PERSON6)  So [PERSON3] I'll email you separately.
But I think you should set up also Zoom account supported 
or founded by the university.
And then I could make you cohost from the very beginning.
And whenever you would be here,
you could allow people to present.
So it's there is this limitation that until the host comes nothing can be presented.
(PERSON3) Aha.

(PERSON3) Yes. 
(PERSON1) And so so [PERSON3] do you think anything to discuss about the interface that you want to give to your annotators?
(PERSON3) Interface was uhm 
I think there we have nothing to discuss about no nothing there.
Will be lot of thing but not uhm about the tool <unintelligible/> of the moment,
but uhm rather I would probably uhm like to discuss with you.
Should I already lots of ask. 
Should I address one annotator or more annotators of the same time.
How that's process  of installation is complicated?
Should I just write for example today to one of my annotators 
and pro- uhm link uhm and refer her to the website with the instalation,
does it work already?
And so we can make just a kind of dry run test for one of the annotators how she manages.
Uhm
So what is the better way.
(PERSON1) Well, so I think I think [PERSON3] we can like just email the <unintelligible/> 
and how to install the interface in Windows or other platform.
And then I'll like <unintelligible/> like one or two days to try on their own.
And if they don't success.
(PERSON3) Uhm, yes it's a good idea. 
Mm-hm.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> whole the training question.
