[PROJECT2] [PROJECT1] KUFR 
or a list what to bring with us
Preparatory Calls
The goal is to have a call every week, so that we are sure we are on track with a

Thu 9.5. at 10 AM
* Pexip: [URL1]
o PIN: 1234
o (the room is ready :)
* Participants: [PERSON9], [PERSON14], [PERSON13], [PERSON4], [PERSON2], [PERSON11]
* ([PERSON8] will be absent; [PERSON14] will take the lead.)
* A summary of all components to be deployed at [PROJECT1]; status of their preparations.
o Ebclient
* Production ready version (we still operate with the "sample") 
* C or Python?
* .NET soon
o Text-to-text clients to test MT and segmentation workers
o Tests
* Test the workers are running
* Test they return plausible output
* Test robustness (they don't die on long audio or on silence)
* [PERSON2] doesn't have access to cruise-control !!!!
o AdminWeb
* Advanced admin web? 
* or scripts to make a summary on demand?
* Script to check fingerprints automatically
o Save and allow browsing all logs to everyone?
* This may be useful and easy to set up at [ORGANIZATION6], we just need to symlink the directory to something presented on our technical web.
* It's not easy for [PROJECT1] -> maybe for future events
* [PERSON2] asks if [ORGANIZATION5] can get access to their servers to check their logs online
o ASR workers: 
* Are there any special tags emitted from [ORGANIZATION3] ASR? E.g. &lt;applause&gt; , &lt;laugh/&gt; etc.?
o Special tag for noise, but it is not transmitted to MT
* en 2x
* De,
* Cs
o Punctuation and segmentation workers
* En
* De
* Cs
* Maybe sentence buffer workers, if we use sentence-level MT
* [PERSON8] would prefer not to have them at all, but the critical condition is that MT would handle sentence fragments well. ([PERSON14] is working on this.)
* Language agnostic
* Configurable online
* -> add functionality to allow [PROJECT3] MT integrator to ignore incomplete sentences (for sentence-level only MT)
* OR, segment and punctuate together with MT?
o MT workers
* -- subsentence level or sentence level?
* Subsentence means beginning of sent. And missing end
* -- single-target or multi-target?
* No multisource is assumed for [PROJECT1] production. [ORGANIZATION5] *may* try to train something but only very experimentally. => not in [ORGANIZATION8] mediator in June
* [ORGANIZATION4] is training multi-target system
* PLEASE, WRITE YOUR NAMES IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRAIN THEM. We can have versions from more people for some directions.
* En -> Cs ([PERSON14], [PERSON4])
* En -> fr -- [ORGANIZATION3] ([PERSON4], )
* En -> de -- [ORGANIZATION3]? [PERSON4]
* En->HU ([PERSON4])
* En->NL ([PERSON4])
* En->PL ([PERSON4])
* En->Ro ([PERSON4])
* De->CS ([PERSON14])
* De->EN [ORGANIZATION3]
* De->FR/IT/ES
* Cs->En ([PERSON14]) (hoping that we will have Czech ASR)
o Integration of [PROJECT3] as MT worker !!
* This is critical. Who has the capacity? How far are we?
* [PERSON4] is going to do it ([PERSON8] is relieved :-)
o Live stream selection -- GUI/console UI (have a look at the libraby curses) and Audio UI
* It's going to be a part of presentation platform
o Presentation platform
* The platform must automatically jump on the available sessions, even if we restart the ebclient as many times we like we go.
* Probably not in June
* Selection of languages to show.
* Presentation of streamed slides
* [PERSON8] promised to do videograbbing+streaming in addition to global subtitles for the main screen. The main screen could however also use the standard presentation platform, if the corresponding web interface works well in fullscreen.
* Fallback needed: the grabbed slides quality may be poor to present on the main screen. If [ORGANIZATION9] says that want the original (i.e. no subtitles mixed in), we won't be able to get the slides to stream at all...
* EN ASR adaptation based on documents provided by participants
* Yes, [ORGANIZATION3] will try
* MT adaptation -- we can get [PROJECT1] from TAUS, anyone interested?
* If yes, for which language pairs?
* [ORGANIZATION4]: Parallel yes, for all EN->..., monolingual no
* [PERSON8] asks: by monolingual you mean target, right? So you are saying that you will happily finetune on parallel closer-matching data but you do not plan any backtranslation to make use of target-only texts, right? ([PERSON8] fully supports this approach.)
* If [PERSON8] is correct, yes, [ORGANIZATION5] will proceed and try to get TAUS data for in-domain, whatever will be available.

* Methodology for selecting the final models
* ASR
* MT
* Live switching during the conference?
* Which test sets?
* Parallel from TAUS ([PROJECT1])
