(PERSON3) Oh, uh, [PERSON11] s- s- said, uh, message that he will be late, so are we waiting for anyone else?
(PERSON1) Uh, I don't think so, [PERSON23] is on vacation, so.
There is nobody else.
(PERSON3) <other_noise/> Okay, so, let's start, I guess.
Hmm.
So, uh, first of all, uh, I created the [ORGANIZATION2] channel.
I hope for everyone got the message so <unintelligible/> can be used as, uh, <other_noise/> I donno, stuff that you don't want to make- uh, write the emails for, but should simplify communication, hopefully.
Uh, what else.
<parallel_talk/> Ta, da, da.<parallel_talk/>
Yeah, I guess that that's it, uh.
Yeah, [PERSON17], how- how was the- how was the [PROJECT3] deadline, you make it?
Uh, you're- you're muted.
(PERSON20) Sorry. 
Oh, we didn't submit it. <other_yawn/>
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON20) So, because- 
yeah, the- like the- the results were unsatisfactory.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) And still like the things were in the process of training, and on Sunday, when I like let it run further, it got like half- half a point of BLEU better so it wouldn't be- yeah, like there was nothing-
I- I thought, you know like two days before <other_noise/> -ore the deadline but finally found out that it's not there.
Can you- <other_noise/> can hear me?
Because I'm a bit -
(PERSON3) Ts- <other_noise/>
(PERSON20) frozen here.
(PERSON3) No problems.
Okay, so there's that, uh, n- well, th- than- if I'm- if I'm correct than the next possible deadline is the [ORGANIZATION5], uh, in, uh, exactly 30 days. 
No, uh, a little bit more than 30 days, so.
I donno, do you plan to resubmit or not resubmit?
Try to submit it for the [ORGANIZATION5]?
(PERSON20) Yeah, we would like to submit it, uh, to the [ORGANIZATION5].
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) Like prepare something.
So n- n- just now we had some- like discussion with [PERSON21].
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) Like how should we continue
with the experiments, like there are 2 parts, uh, of the- f- of the experiments.
1 is <other_noise/> call it data augmentation.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) <unintelligible/> And it's- it's that instead of, uh, n- n- normal processes that you first back-translate- uh, like the- some suggested process by [ORGANIZATION1] guys have used that for pre-training you back-translate- or train on back-translated data -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) and then you finetune on original data.
<other_yawn/> And, uh, instead of back-translated data we wanted to use the <other_noise/> paraphrases, which are done by back-translation -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) but, uh, with the constraints, so that the paraphrases are the most like d- distant from the original, originals.
Yeah, and so- so the hyp- hypothesis was that in this way, we can get like better- better score when- when- whe- when we pre-train it that the- <other_yawn/> the source is more distance from the original.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) Or like the back-translated source is more distant from the original, on which we finetune later.
Okay, I- I don't wanna to dis- I don't wanna describe it more, like I have some numbers from it, like interesting findings or some like observations, because I- we also, um, tried [PROJECT4], -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) and the interesting thing is that, uh, it actually ignores the- the- the second source.
When 1 of the sources is orig, or original ou- input.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) Yeah, so now we have to like investigate further, how to change it or- and when we change it, where <laugh/> it's going to be better or it's gonna be sub-optimal or something, yeah.
(PERSON3) Okay, uh, I guess, uh, can you please fill it like in 1 or 2 sentences into the doc so we have the- uh, notes about it?
(PERSON20) Okay.
(PERSON3) So- so- yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Uh, oh, so ne- next one, I guess it <unintelligible/> <another_language/> that's stuck.
Or -
(PERSON1) Uh, we- uh, I th- I think, um, [PERSON17] can confirm <unintelligible/> everything is done on our end and we just ship that to [ORGANIZATION1] for them to test, like -
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON1) we- we prepared the experiment and this is like the far- the la- lastest thing, we hope.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON1) And, uh, they didn't get back to us over the weekend, but I guess that's okay, so we gotta just wakin- waiting for them and we expect that during this week we get some reply.
And hopefully, they'll say that everything is okay and they'll start doing the experiment but
I donno.
(PERSON3) Uh, I h- I hope that- that next Monday we will least know that they are starting to do their part, right.
But yeah, is good- good to hear that- that, uh, we- we have everything done.
On our side.
(PERSON20) Yeah, I- like last week I just sent them I'll-
so I- I- I push the ball on their side <laugh/> and, uh, they- they told us that they will check it and told us that it's not a good idea that- uh, to add another machine translation system for, uh, Czech-English.
Yeah, w- we also think is not a good i- 
like because, in his way, we need to have more participants to cover -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) like sufficiently all of these MT systems.
But still, I think we can run it.
And when we f- find what we w- like enough about those, uh, [PROJECT9] systems -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) uh, we can switch them off and replace them by the [PROJECT8].
And li- I- I mean like in the exper- like when the, uh, experiment's already run -
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON20) and running, and s- so I just told them to start and they- yeah.
So- so I prompted them today and they haven't replied yet, so.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
Okay, so -
(PERSON20) Let's hope that ch- they will check it- check it, uh, as soon as possible and do not- <cough/> do not refuse to do it because of whatever.
(PERSON3) Yeah, that's- that's good, I guess, uh, if they don't reply until Thursday or Friday it would be nice maybe to nudge them a little bit, like whether -
(PERSON20) Hmm.
I- I- um, like l- last week in the email I sent- I- like I told them that we would like to aim it to the [ORGANIZATION5] deadline.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) So the statistics or the experiment should be done by the end of the August, so.
(PERSON3) Okay, that will be nice, yeah.
(PERSON20) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Okay, so let's- let's say that that's fine, it's going according to plan.
And agai-
(PERSON1) Uh, well, according to plan, like -
(PERSON3) Oh. <laugh/>
(PERSON1) all this experiment is- it's -
(PERSON20) <laugh/>
(PERSON1) in progress for like 8 months already, <laugh/> so. <laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, okay.
Acco- according to current plan, right.
Uh, <other_yawn/> so.
(PERSON20) Yes. <laugh/>
(PERSON3) <another_language/>
Hi.
Uh, muted still.
(PERSON1) <another_language/>
(PERSON3) Uh, you're muted.
(PERSON20) You're muted.
(PERSON3) And <other_yawn/>
still muted.
Just- just click the little -
(PERSON2) Ah.
(PERSON3) mike.
Yeah.
That's it.
(PERSON2) <another_language/> <laugh/>
(PERSON3) Oh, uh, it's- it's hidden, yeah, yeah.
Uh, so <other_yawn/> yeah, we were just talking that the Taco <another_language/> is currently been, uh, sent to [ORGANIZATION1] and we are waiting for response and, uh, the- 
<parallel_talk/> uh, okay, maybe [PERSON11] is- oh, it's fine.<parallel_talk/>
Okay, so and, uh, the [PROJECT4] was- uh, er, is- is that the- the plan is to try to submit for [ORGANIZATION5] now.
Like, er, er, they- they didn't make it for the [PROJECT3].
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON20) Yeah, so long story short for- for [PERSON11].
So we- we found- in the end, we found nothing interesting in the experiments that we have run so far.
(PERSON2) What? 
(PERSON20) I can -
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
(PERSON20) <laugh/> I can- I can s- send you details in the- uh, or like write down the details o- to the agenda, and also send a link to the table where we collect results and maybe you will find something there, but- 
we have some i- further ideas which is- like with that- which should- what- that we want to try, but yeah, so.
Um -
(PERSON2) Well. 
Uh, ho- how come nothing interesting?
(PERSON20) we- we want to retry it for [ORGANIZATION5].
(PERSON2) Yeah, but- uh, but how come nothing interesting?
Uh, it's- uh, because it's all as expected that the, uh, s- uh, quality estimates are totally useless and-
or what, uh.
(PERSON20) Hmm.
Wh- w- wait- wait- wait to quality estimates there was nothing.
No, uh -
(PERSON2) So I- I'm- I'm- maybe I'm confusing it, so -
(PERSON20) Yeah.
(PERSON2) yeah.
(PERSON20) This is with [PROJECT4] translation and -
(PERSON2) [PROJECT4], okay.
Yeah, that was the paraphrases.
(PERSON20) Yeah, paraphrases.
Yeah, so -
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm, okay, yeah.
(PERSON20) Um, like they were like two branches, uh, uh, one was data a- augmentation and the other one was like truly [PROJECT4] translation, and- y- yeah, so like in the first part-
with- like we had better numbers but in the end, this was still like in the process of learning, and on Sunday after the deadline, I had even better numbers.
So it wasn't ready yet for- for like in the time of deadline.
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) So- so we would- we would have claim- claimed something that is not true or-
<laugh/> yeah, so. 
(PERSON2) Well, uh, not- not- not the full truth, not- not as good as a -
(PERSON20) Not the full truth, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON20) And, um, with the [PROJECT4], uh, it happened that, uh, like when we train it, uh, it's- it's just decides to ignore the other source.
And so- so now I'm investigating how to f- force him to- to take advantage of both sources or like 3 -
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm. 
(PERSON20) not to just rely on 1 source in the end.
(PERSON2) Yeah, uh -
(PERSON20) So if like I -
(PERSON2) And that- so the true [PROJECT4] is what data set?
(PERSON20) <other_yawn/> Uh, it's- uh, it's originals, and to these originals, I create, uh, paraphrases by ParaBank rewriter, yeah?
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
Uh- uh, and -
(PERSON20) And so if I- if I replaced the par-
like in when I train the system-
and if I replace [ORGANIZATION3], uh, input with shaft <other_noise/> <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION3] input or blanks, empty- empty file -
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) it just remains the same.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so I think -
(PERSON20) And if I- if I do it and- uh, the other way, so I replace the originals with empty, so it- it just translates to empty.
(PERSON2) Okay. 
Yeah. 
Uh, so, uh, in the training phase, I suggest that you do the same thing, uh, that you also, uh, delete, uh, the original channel and -
(PERSON20) Yeah.  
(PERSON2) uh, s- train to only 1 [ORGANIZATION3].
And also that- uh, the question is whether, uh, you want to make it positional, so that the first encoder is always empty or the source, uh, and the second encoder is always [ORGANIZATION3] or empty, or if you want to swap it as well -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) so that [ORGANIZATION3] can appear in the first encoder as well and the original can appear in the, uh, second encoder, uh -
(PERSON20) Yeah.
(PERSON2) and then -
(PERSON20) That's how I wanted to try- like to try to swap it but I'm afraid that then, uh, like the final score would be like 2 BLEU points lower than- than -
(PERSON2) It's possible.
Yeah, but it's- it's, um -
(PERSON20) And if I- then if I train on ori- originals only. 
So that's my impression ot- of what happened so far.
(PERSON2) Yeah, that- that -
(PERSON20) I haven't tried these experiment yet, but yeah, I'm going to try it but this is what I -
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
(PERSON20) don't like, it's -
(PERSON2) So only disabling it during the training so that you keep it positional and it know- it learns that it should trust primarily the- uh, the source, the first encodator -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) uh, and only if it's empty it should trust the second one.
That is- uh, I agree that this would probably get a higher BLEU score.
And I would do one more thing, and that would be, uh, damaging, uh, the- uh, either of them, uh, so I would actually replace, uh, content words, for example, or start with totally random words- replacing random words to the random words, uh, in the source channel.
Uh, so one of the channels should contain the good information, one of the channels -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) uh, should be damaged.
Uh, and it should learn to, uh, like, uh, m- k- recover from this.
Uh, and, uh, the- the question is what types of mistakes, uh, we should create in the data.
Uh, so, uh, it should be primarily, uh, mistakes which are possible for the human user, so that -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) uh, the human user coul-
I would probably start with typos, so, uh, talk to -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) k- uh, uh, correct- uh, who is the author of corrector- uh, [PERSON10] Na- uh, n- no.
No, not- not [PERSON10]. 
The- er, [PERSON16]? 
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) So get in touch with him, because he and [PERSON19]- I think, if I'm not mistaken- are working on, uh, uh, like automatic creation of- uh, or it may be already, uh, um, Ja- [PERSON14], uh, cooperators of errors, or a system which creates errors. 
So, uh, we could damage one of the sources and lead the other one okay, or damage both of the sources, uh, but in a different way. 
Uh, like randomly, obviously, but they are different already. 
Uh, and then it sh- it should learn to- to merge this information, so -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) I would suggest noisifying the- the training data.
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) Uh, b- by the way, the corrector, I think it's [PERSON5] and [PERSON6]. 
With [PERSON7] -
(PERSON2) No, that's the old one. 
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay. 
O- o- okay. 
So yeah, it's bo- it's possible that [PERSON16] is actually working on something similar. 
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay. 
(PERSON2) So please ask him and -
(PERSON20) Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) So yeah -
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) don- don't feel bad about like the- the missed [PROJECT3] opportunity, uh, but it's- uh, even- even if we miss a deadline it is useful because it has pushed you to- towards, uh, actually getting the thing running, getting it trained.
Yeah, so it's a- a pity but not too bad, it -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) it progress, you are making progress.
(PERSON20) Yeah. 
(PERSON3) Maybe, um, [PERSON17], you're- uh, okay, you're at- at work but you're <unintelligible/>, right?
This week.
Or recently.
(PERSON20) Y- yes, but tomorrow I'm planning to come to [LOCATION1]. 
(PERSON3) Okay, uh, well, I'll return to [LOCATION2] on Tuesday -
(PERSON20) <other_yawn/> Oh.
(PERSON3) evening, so- so -
(PERSON20) On Tuesday evening.
(PERSON3) yeah, but okay.
Okay, but we can- can -
(PERSON20) Okay, so I can come on Wednesd- or I can come to [LOCATION1] on Wednesday, I- I just want 1 day go to [LOCATION1], so if you are there on Wednesday I can come there.
(PERSON3) Yeah, Wednesday should be fine.
(PERSON20) Because on Thursday I will be in Slovakia already, so.
(PERSON3) Okay, I- I'm just m- interesting in more of the details to -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) the- yea- you know, to- to -
(PERSON20) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON3) er, so- so I can also start thinking about it little bit and maybe trip in -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) with ideas.
(PERSON20) Yeah, okay, like no problem and maybe I would al- also <other_yawn/> enjoy like somebody will like help me- helping me with this, because yeah -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) we- we are working with [PERSON21] on it, but he will slowly -
(PERSON3) Well, he is officially employed by [ORGANIZATION1], right, so.
(PERSON20) Yeah, and -
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON20) that's- that's- s- so- so I- I think he'll slo- slowly back off from the- from this, uh, project, then- yeah, we- <unintelligible/> he promised me that we- we should finish it but, uh, like maybe the- the experiments that we want to finish and not some like extensions.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Okay, s-
(PERSON2) There could even emerge, uh, IP issues.
Uh, so, I- I've switch off my, uh, camera because I'm, uh, starting to -
(PERSON3) That's fine.
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) Yeah, uh.
(PERSON3) Uh, okay, so maybe if that's everything, uh, I just want to mention- [PERSON11], I- I created the Zoom, I sent the email and hopefully, we will be using it for some, uh, more like technical stuff, something that- you know, it's just -
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) too much to write an email in my opinion.
Uh, there was a question whether we use it for conferences, but basically, we decided not to because I donno if it can record and whether you even can make- create conferences there.
(PERSON2) Uh -
(PERSON20) Uh, you're talking- sorry, you are talking about [ORGANIZATION2], not -
(PERSON2) [ORGANIZATION2].
(PERSON20) not Zoom.
(PERSON3) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I meant-
(PERSON2) Yeah, exactly, I was confused.
(PERSON3) I meant [ORGANIZATION2], yeah, yeah.
Okay, sorry about that.
Uh -
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) So [PERSON17], uh, you actually looked into that, uh, you cannot have a call of more than 2 peopl- <other_yawn/> uh, more than -
(PERSON20) Oh, just somebody told it during today's lunch, I think [PERSON9] or- or someth- wha- that you- you can't have more than th- 2 people in the call -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) when you are- have the free version -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) and you also cannot share the screen or something like this.
(PERSON3) Okay, well, I was wondering whether we can use [ORGANIZATION2] at least when I call to [PERSON4]- uh, it's [PERSON4], right? <laugh/>
I always mess up the manes so I- sorry. 
Uh, so, <other_yawn/> uh, I don't know, if we are going to call like, uh, we- the 3 of us, so it- we cannot use it, I guess.
(PERSON20) Uh.
(PERSON15) Um, you say using [ORGANIZATION2]?
For the -
(PERSON3) Yes. 
Uh, because sometimes- 
well, there were some issues with my connection on Whatsapp, so maybe [ORGANIZATION2] may solve it.
Well, we can try it, n- I don't know, tomorrow or something.
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON15) If- if it would be just bo- uh, uh, just me and [PERSON13], we can do this -
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON15) only by [ORGANIZATION2], but if -
(PERSON3) Yeah. 
(PERSON15) [PERSON17] will- we'll be together we can try through right Whatsapp, right? 
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON15) That-s no problem.
(PERSON3) Well, we would- we would- we would use- the Zoom might be bet- definitely better, but Zoom is reserve only for this time, so- so we cannot actually use this room for the- for the, er, lunch meetings, right. 
So.
<other_yawn/> Uh, but it's- it's- it's okay, I guess.
So a last thing is, uh, [PERSON4] is trying to, uh, install [PROJECT8] for GPU.
We are currently- he has- he has run into some issues with specifying CUDA libraries.
And we are trying to solve it.
I'm not sure- [PERSON11], I've noticed that there is a- in the [PROJECT7] directory, there are several [PROJECT8] subfolders- or subdial- subdirectories.
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) Uh, do you know anything about that? 
Or I guess we should ask [PERSON2], right, he was compiling it. 
(PERSON2) Yes -
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) he probably has, uh, the- the best experience.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Uh -
(PERSON3) Like I'm- I'm n- not completely sure, uh, what are the issues will with the CUDA compilation -
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) in [PROJECT8].
The CPU version was fine, right?
You- you were- you had no problems.
Yeah.  
(PERSON15) Yeah, yeah, I just ran the- the script and  -
(PERSON20) And does it -
(PERSON15) it worked.
(PERSON20) does it fail in the- during the compilation or already in the configuration or like generating a Makefile by CMake?
(PERSON3) It's a-
(PERSON15) Um -
(PERSON3) yeah, go on. 
(PERSON15) I'm sorry.
Yeah, but, um, it- it was not finding CUDA and o- on the final, uh, <other_yawn/> C, uh, I- I think it's CM- uh, the CMake command.  
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON15) And it- even though I'm- I'm using- I'm passing the- the- <other_yawn/> the Parabol, the- the path to the- to the correct coder, uh, it- it doesn't find it, uh, I- I don't know why.  
(PERSON20) And- so and- so you compile it logged into one of the DLL -
(PERSON15) Actually, I was using Chronos because, uh -
(PERSON2) That- that's a different- uh, that's a different machine, so they- they differ in co- hulp- hardware configuration.
(PERSON20) Hmm.
(PERSON3) Yeah, I- I- I explained that.    
(PERSON20) <unintelligible/> better to go to some DLLs or TDLLs because Chronos it's -
(PERSON15) Okay, yeah -
(PERSON20) like outdated.
(PERSON15) [PERSON13] told me to- to do this to- today.
(PERSON3) So the thing is -
(PERSON15) So I'll try this.
(PERSON3) the- the thing is that I think it should be- it's a good experi- like exercise to compile it in Chronos, because the issues were with finding the correct paths.
I think the problem is- uh, and again, we still haven't figured it out, but it might be that even though, uh, [PERSON4] specified the correct root directory, where the CUDA is installed, it- the Cmake libraries cannot really find the subdirectory structure, because it- it couldn't find the NVCC compiler, the N- the Nvidia compiler, right.
And it is located in those subdirectories, so- so there might be problem with some path name resolution or something.
But -
(PERSON15) Yeah, I'm making something wrong. 
(PERSON3) yeah.
So- so until we resolve that, I told [PERSON4] that he can try, uh, running- running training on- <other_yawn/> on the TDLL, because in the [PROJECT7] project directory there is already [PROJECT8] compiled against the TDLL 5, so it should be working if it's compart correctly.
So -
(PERSON15) Yeah, I didn't try yet, but.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So we- we are sort- yeah, so it's progressing, I think you- you kinda getting used to working on the cluster, I think you have all the access that you need, so it's fine and it's- it's- it's alright.
(PERSON20) Or there is- or I can link you to my [PROJECT8], which is not my [PROJECT8] but [PERSON21]'s [PROJECT8], so. <laugh/>
Yes.
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON20) If you want to train -
(PERSON2) And -
(PERSON20) uh, something, so either use the [PROJECT7] or ask me to- or I can link you my- my <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON15) Okay.
() <other_yawn/> Yeah.
(PERSON15) Yeah, I -
(PERSON2) And once you succeed -
(PERSON15) Mm-hmm?
Sorry. 
(PERSON2) uh, just please- uh, please remind me once- uh, once you succeed with the compilation, what is the goal, uh, uh, what is the first task to deal with, uh, once [PROJECT8] is compiled?
(PERSON3) P- k- k- or- uh, currently I think that, uh, that's good- good thing to do is, uh, to try train, uh, some larger- or you know, reasonably large model on GPU just to get a gist of how- how to actually set up the environment variables.
And how to a- a- co- n- check that, er, even though you're on a GPU machine, that you are actually computing on GPU and such like- you know.
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
(PERSON3) Because I do know that there can be problems with that, so- so-
(PERSON20) These are still like, uh, toy tasks, uh, um, we haven't -
() Yeah.
(PERSON15) Yeah, actually, you told me to- to train with Czech-English data set, right?
(PERSON3) Yes. 
(PERSON15) And -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON15) I will do that -
(PERSON20) Yeah. 
(PERSON15) as soon as I- I fix this -
(PERSON2) Yeah, mm-hmm.
(PERSON15) or I start using the [PROJECT7].
(PERSON20) And I can link you also to the hyperparameters that I used for training, it's cause -
(PERSON15) Okay, yeah.
(PERSON20) I haven't figure- figure out them like <laugh/> myself but also copied them from [PERSON21] and he copied it from [ORGANIZATION1].
(PERSON18) Yeah.
(PERSON20) I think those para- like hyperparameters are -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON20) proved to be optimal or something.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> just one thing, uh, that I wanted to mention, uh, uh, I- my Ph.D. student [PERSON4], who is in [LOCATION2] in- in person, also has, uh, just- uh, will be starting to compile his own [PROJECT8], so please, uh, if- if you can- uh, [PERSON13], if you can, uh, email [PERSON4] just -
(PERSON3) Uh, I guess -
(PERSON2) [PERSON4]. <laugh/>  
(PERSON3) Or like let him -
(PERSON2) Uh, but I think -
(PERSON3) le- let him know that he can t- turn to us.
Uh -
(PERSON2) Yes. 
(PERSON3) yeah.
That's the -
(PERSON2) I -
(PERSON3) it's the phrase, right?
(PERSON2) I told him, but I think it could be also useful if, uh, [PERSON22] and [PERSON4], uh, would be, uh, also directly connected, because they will be t- running into the same type of- types of issues.
(PERSON3) Yeah. 
But just please le- like, uh, push him so- so he contacts us, er, because well, it's in his own interest, right, first of all and second of all, I might -
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> uh, I told him already that he can contact you.
Uh -
(PERSON3) Yeah. 
(PERSON2) I'll- I'll t- I'll t- uh, repeat it again, so that he really does. 
(PERSON3) Okay, okay, that's- that's fine.
Uh, okay, so this is the technical stuff.
And I guess, hopefully next week, we can start talking about plans for the [PROJECT6].
Like currently the thing is -
(PERSON15) Yeah. 
(PERSON3) we need to look up, uh, some, uh, related work we can s- start like build on top of it o- or something like that because I currently have, uh, only limited knowledge about the state-of-the-art.
I know that Mi- [PERSON17] was, uh, mentioning some- some papers, like at least with, uh, relation to [ORGANIZATION6].
Uh, so maybe -
(PERSON20) You mean the constraint, uh -
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, there's- the- those ones.
So yeah, I think they are already linked in the doc or not.
I- I still need to read- uh read them, at- at least skim through them, so -
(PERSON15) Yeah.
(PERSON3) so yeah, we can- we can <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON15) I read them.
There are 2, right?
And uh -
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay, so yeah, so that's good.
So I also -
(PERSON15) Yeah. 
(PERSON3) try to- try to catch up and yeah, we- we can start brainstorming about the possible, uh -
(PERSON20) Uh, I have to- I forgot, uh, to write to [PERSON12] <unintelligible/>, I have to -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) ask him about
um, what's the -
(PERSON3) Well- yes.
(PERSON20) status of implementation of, uh, those col- co- these constraint decoding in [PROJECT8] and how can we improve it.
Because if I understand it- or remember it correctly, it only <other_noise/>
but, so, yeah, I- I have to write him. <other_yawn/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON15) I lost the end, I donno if -
(PERSON3) Um, yeah, he's go- he's going to write to [ORGANIZATION1] -
(PERSON20) Okay, yeah.
(PERSON3) what's the status on the -
(PERSON15) Yeah, about the- about the- the code, right?
But, uh, it- <other_noise/> there's a better version of [ORGANIZATION6], right?
There's a -
(PERSON3) Uh, yes, but the- the- the thing is that we would ideally want to work with, uh, [PROJECT8] because it's definitely going to be faster.
And I- I still hope that we will not focus on the, uh, like im- developing new technologies, but li- like let's- let's work with the data and try to figure out how- how we can exploit the- the constrained decoding techniques.  
As they are right now. 
(PERSON20) But if it's not implemented in [PROJECT8] yet -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON20) so then we have to- e- either for s- [PERSON12] to implement it on- or like that's really compli- this will be complicated, or rather implement it ourselves. <other_noise/> 
(PERSON15) <other_yawn/> Yeah, so. 
(PERSON20) And I wouldn't go for [ORGANIZATION6] yo- ei- n- l- like even though it's already implemented there, uh, [ORGANIZATION6] is slow to train, or much slower. 
And yeah, in the end, we have to all work with [PROJECT8], so.
As soon as we <other_noise/> like change to [PROJECT8], so it will be better. 
(PERSON3) Uh, <other_yawn/> well, okay. 
Uh, so another thing I- I will look exactly what is the deliverable we're supposed to deliver in, let's say, uh, 17 months, for the [PROJECT6] 
Because I don't think that we actually promised a- 
like the constrained decoding should not necessarily be the part of the final product. 
So as long as we have some interesting research with results we should be fine. 
But -
(PERSON20) Okay. 
(PERSON3) I need to double-check on that. 
And- and in that case, we have much more freedom because we can- we can implement or experiment in whichever framework we- we want to, so -
(PERSON20) Mm-hmm. 
(PERSON3) that's it.
<other_yawn/> Uh -
(PERSON1) Uh, I am sorry to jump in, but -
(PERSON3) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON1) I have to go, so, uh <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Yes, definitely. 
(PERSON1) Uh, I <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON3) Yeah, I th- I think- I think that that should be everything, right? 
There- there is nothing else to- to discuss. 
Or nothing urgent like at least, uh, if- if you rem- uh, like <other_yawn/> uh, forgot something you can- you can s- send an email to the- to the, uh, [PROJECT2]. 
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION2]. 
(PERSON3) Yes. 
So I think it's fine, so I guess let's- let's cut it here and- and let's see each other next week.
(PERSON1) Okay, bye. 
(PERSON3) Okay?
Mm-hmm. 
Bye.
(PERSON15) Byebye. 
(PERSON20) Okay, bye.
