Tue Apr 28, 16.00-16.30
• [PERSON15]:
o ! Please list all your past activities here:
• [URL]
o Thanks for your IWSLT submissions!
o UniHack:
• [URL]
• [PERSON10]
o All EAF files in testset dataset were checked (find mismatch words between OSt and EAF files )
o ASRev script was written and SLTev was updated to evaluate ASR files. 
o A bash script was made to evaluate [ORGANIZATION6]-[ORGANIZATION6] submission. 
o TODO:
• Make bash scripts for the other submissions. 
• Make a copy of all submissions and change name and files format ([PERSON15] suggest)
• [PERSON11]
o IWSLT submission
o TODO:
• CS- Segmenter- re-train using increased word vocab size and pre-trained embeddings
• [PERSON15] says to use as much data as possible and use small sentences.
• [PERSON15] mentioned about Czech 2.0 (refer- [PERSON8]). [PROJECT7] also has synthetic parallel data from Czech news.
• Daily testing of Czech SLT and English SLT 
• [PERSON13]'s [PROJECT5] Model to be integrated for the daily testing sessions
• Coming up- UniHack
• [PERSON16]
o collecting mono data for non-[ORGANIZATION8] langs
• these will appear: ….please add the path
• The goal is to have a large synth-parallel corpus, English synthetic, target mono in 43 languages genuine
o collecting bitexts based on seed urls from annotators
o Status of annotators:
• [URL]
o Status of languages for test set:
• [URL]
• [PERSON9]
o Updated ASR model, loading time much faster.
o Waiting for some adaptation texts
• [PERSON15] asks: please do not wait but rather actively check if [PERSON18] is collecting some texts
o @[PERSON11] or @[PERSON9], test the port with nc before loading ASR
o Starting working on [PROJECT2] paper
o Getting in touch with [PERSON2], meeting recordings have revised transcript so they could serve for evaluation or adaptation
• [PERSON4]
o working on IWSLT, running on evaluation and models
o starting to consider window-based translation, should get in touch with [PERSON3] who already worked on this and has some results.
• [PERSON13]
o Didn't have a lot of time this week
o Researched options to collect speaker ID data from Zoom calls
• Waiting for next version of Zoom web SDK, which should be in 1-2 weeks, will enable me to send who's speaking live
• Possible to do through windows->wine as plan B
• When done, will result in a custom [PROJECT3] zoom client, which can then also be used to download audio
• Will eventually require small modifications to [PERSON20]'s server etc.
o Researching options to improve performance of models on noisy data
