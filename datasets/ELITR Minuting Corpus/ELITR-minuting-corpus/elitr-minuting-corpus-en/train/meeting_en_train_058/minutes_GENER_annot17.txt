Virtual coffee hours minutes evaluation
Date: 12. 11. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON3], [PERSON8], [PERSON6], [PERSON9], [PERSON11].
Purpose of meeting: evaluating minutes, selecting criteria for evaluating minutes, discussing what makes good minutes


- Minutes 02. 
-- advantages: grouped according to the topics.
-- disadvantages: unnecessary details, too long, spelling mistakes, factual inconsistencies, the annotator did not understand all the points. 
-- Length is not the only problem, it is rather the length combined with inconsistencies. 
-- Double summarization: objectives are listed at the top, then topics described in more detail. 
--- This would pose a problem when aligning, since the tool does not allow many to many alignments.
-- [PERSON6] deemed some sentences incomplete.
--- However, [PERSON3], who was present at the meeting thought that they were perfectly fine.
--- They differed on what they found understandable. 

- Minutes 03. 
-- advantages: also has two levels including a high level summary. 
-- disadvantages: too short, abstract, not exhaustive, not informative enough, incorrect spelling, ambiguity. 
-- Done by [PERSON6].
-- [PERSON3] is unsure of the completeness, but understands the details fully. 
-- Some sentences will be understandable to participants of the meeting, but not to somebody external. 

- Minutes 04.
-- advantages: correct, relevant, readable, topical, understandable.
-- disadvantages: not informative enough, missing topics, abstract, action points are not really visible. 
-- Seem like a text.
-- Done by [PERSON11]. 

- Minutes 05. 
-- advantages: probably the best, the annotator understood the content, decisions were grouped together with topics, relevant, correct, informative, thorough. 
-- disadvantages: reason for extension of the project (COVID) was not mentioned in the minutes, spelling mistakes.
-- [PERSON6] and [PERSON3] again disagreed on the understandability of some sentences.

- Minutes 06.
-- advantages: detailed.
-- disadvantages: contains details which are not in the transcript (such as links), incomplete.
-- Going beyond the transcript to retrieve links etc. can never be done by a system. 
-- The system would be really confused if it was trained by these minutes.
-- These minutes were the original agenda for the meeting, prepared by [PERSON3]. 

- Minutes 07.
-- Done by [PERSON8].
-- She wanted to make an example of bad minutes.
-- But she did not finish them. 

- Minutes 08.
-- advantages: on topic, grouped according to topics.
-- disadvantages: too many details, redundant, some information not relevant, some ideas not fully understood. 
-- One of the headings was NLP technologies, but the discussion was about a report on NLP technologies, not the technologies themselves. 
-- Done by an annotator who has worked with minutes half-professionally. 
-- Similar to meeting 05, but [PERSON9] would rate 05 higher. 
-- Seem more like jotting down points rather than minuting. 
-- The automatic system will probably generate similar minutes to these. 

- Minutes 09. 
-- advantages: milestones are mentioned.
-- disadvantages: not informative, errors, transcript was not fully understood, not structured, not hierarchical, unbalanced.
-- The worst minutes. 
-- Seem like key words.
-- They seem to be created by a program, even though they were created by a human. 

- Summarizing the criteria for good minutes.
-- Information preservation is probably the most important. 
-- [PERSON8]'s criteria for evaluating: correctness, relevance, coverage, readability, informativeness. 
-- Grammaticality is the least important criterion. 
-- It is important to think about who the audience of the minutes will be. 
-- The hierarchical structure of the meeting should be uncovered.
-- Action points have to be mentioned along with what has been done earlier.

- To do next.
-- [PERSON9] will share his notes with everybody. 
-- [PERSON11] will create automatic minutes of this particular transcript. 
--- Through that we will find out how they are different from the human summaries. 
-- Proceed with designing the manual evaluation method.
--- Formalize what was talked about into evaluation metrics.
--- Train annotators in this method (can be done later - April-May).
