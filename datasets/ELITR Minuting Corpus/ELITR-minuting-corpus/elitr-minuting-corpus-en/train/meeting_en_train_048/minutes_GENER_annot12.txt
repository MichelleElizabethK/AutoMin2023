Date: 30. 09. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON2], [PERSON4], [PERSON5], [PERSON6]
Meeting purpose: Preparation for the survey, how to organize papers and divide tasks.


Obstacles, basic steps of the process:
- Participants had difficulties downloading the papers from [ORGANIZATION5].
- Papers from [ORGANIZATION5] will be transferred to the Temp folder.
- If a file is relevant, the process starts with renaming the end of the file name.
-- only after verifying the relevance should they be moved to MLR folder.


Conclusions, detailed objectives:
- It will be both dialogue and meeting summarization papers from [PROJECT2].
-- Too much restriction would lead to few papers.
- There are 45 papers in the [PROJECT2] folder.
- Both the label and the record should be put into the Excel sheet "Automatic minuting".
-- D already went through 30 papers.
- There are 78 papers in total (including [PROJECT2] papers).
- It is important to rename the file and find the corresponding pip tag at the same time.
-- If a file is not relevant, it shouldn't be renamed.


Optimization of the process, important notes:
- Special folder named Not relevant was created.
- It is necessary to check the title in MLR to avoid duplicates
-- In case of duplicates the file in the Temp folder should be deleted.
- The overall process consists of: Verifying relevance, putting the label, finding the pip tag, updating Excel sheet and the pip tag file in Overleaf. 
- [ORGANIZATION5] repository was completely deleted.
- Choosing the right pip tag from the corresponding category is important. 
- The labels should be added to columns A and F in the Excel sheet.
- Dividing the papers seems a little confusing to the participants.
- B has created a document to make the division easier.
-- Lead column was created to avoid confusion.
- Recorded calls will be used as datasets to create agenda and minutes.
