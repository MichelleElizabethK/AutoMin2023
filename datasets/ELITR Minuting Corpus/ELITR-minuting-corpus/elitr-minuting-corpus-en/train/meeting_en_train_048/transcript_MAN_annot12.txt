(PERSON4) So, um, [PERSON2], m- uh, would [PERSON3] join our call today?
(PERSON2) Uh, uh, normally shou- he's not supposed to.
Uh, do you need to discuss something with him?
I can ask him.
(PERSON4) Yeah, um, exactly, like last tame [PERSON5] told <unintelligible/> that we have to like -
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON4) discuss something between -
(PERSON2) I see- I see.
(PERSON4) It's only decision -
(PERSON2) Yeah, I see [PERSON6] and I don't see [PERSON5].
Uh, now. 
Yeah, [PERSON6] is writing that she can hear, 
but- and she has muted. 
(PERSON4) I dunno if -
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> [PERSON6], you have a muted microphone, maybe, uh, we cannot hear you because you have mu- uh, because -
(PERSON6) See. 
Okay, can you hear me now?
(PERSON2) Perfectly, very g-
(PERSON4) Yes. 
(PERSON6) Ah, okay. 
(PERSON2) I- I am goi- so I will go ask [PERSON3] about.
(PERSON4) Okay. 
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
So I think [PERSON5] is saying something in the group.
(PERSON4) All the meeting links are in the meet. 
If they accept, they can easily get.
With the invite.
(PERSON6) Oh, [PERSON5] joined. 
(PERSON5) Yes, I'm he- <other_yawn/> I'm here. <other_yawn/>
I'm here. 
(PERSON4) Okay, so this is perfect.
This is perfect.
If all of us can join- uh, can hear each other.
<unintelligible/> 
Wonderful.
(PERSON6) Yes. 
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) It is much clearer, right?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) Yes, it's better. 
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) So I think, um, [PERSON2] is gone to, uh, [PERSON3] to ask if he can join us. 
Are y- [PERSON2], are you there?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) It is some noise I guess. 
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
[PERSON5], are you in the seminar? <laugh/>
(PERSON5) Seminar? What seminar?
(PERSON6) It is this background noise <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Oh, yes. 
But is my- it's my colleague.
It's my colleague.
(PERSON6) Oh, okay, okay.
Okay. 
<unintelligible/>
So, uh, at- uh, [PERSON4], can- did you fix that, uh, papers- paper thing? 
(PERSON4) Hmm.
Not yet.
(PERSON6) Not yet? 
Oka- you don't have it on your system maybe if you can send me, uh, the link of speech maybe? 
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) So the- I can verif-
(PERSON4) I'm not finding- I'm not finding in my system, that's the problem.  
(PERSON6) Oh, okay. 
And if you download the- that entire folder?
You're also not able to download it?
(PERSON4) Yeah, I will- I will do that.
I will do that. 
(PERSON6) Okay. 
Because I think if yo- you also do that, you are also going to get that error. 
<unintelligible/>  So I believe, uh, downloading each paper would be a thing then.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) Uh, so I think, uh, it- it's starting of October and, uh, it is high time I think, if you want to send the paper by December, we should at least start now. 
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
I agree. 
(PERSON6) Because survey usually takes time. 
(PERSON4) Let me- let me- let me do this by, um, today.
Today except. 
(PERSON6) Yeah, so, and- and the very first thing is, uh, divide the papers. 
So
which- which I talk later
(PERSON4) Uh, the very first thing is -
(PERSON5) What's the problem? 
First of all, what's the problem with the- the cluster?
You can access it or not or?
Because we have to remove one the repositories, otherwise we get confused.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) So can you download all the papers from [ORGANIZATION5] and put them in em- in this template fold- folder that I sent you?
(PERSON4) Yes. 
I -
(PERSON5) Because I cannot download them. 
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> trying to do that, but- yeah.
I will prepare some time to do that, but I will do that for sure.
(PERSON5) But can you download them? Because I cannot. 
They are corrupted when I download them. 
(PERSON4) Yeah, I've not try downloading, I'm- I was trying to find the papers in my system, so give me- give me a bit, by- by today I will like, uh, either upload somewhere. 
Not in the [ORGANIZATION5].
(PERSON5) It sh- shouldn't- you shouldn't take that long I mean it's like a bunch of files if you- y- you just move them.
It's like the [ORGANIZATION5] is kind of problematic, so you better remove everything from [ORGANIZATION5], the entire structure I mean.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, I will do that. I said I w- I will do that, hey? Yeah?
(PERSON5) The entire meeting summarization with <unintelligible/> literature folder is removed from there, because it's not good to leave files and data in different <unintelligible/>.
So remove everything from there and try to upload them and we will <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) So, [PERSON6], if I- if I upload it, if I upload it in a- uh, in the server would you be able to rename those?
Or, uh -
(PERSON6) I- I'm- I'm not sure.
I not- I'm not sure if I, uh-
[PERSON5], will I be able to rename on the server?
(PERSON5) Uh, yes, I think yes.
All of us have access.
(PERSON6) The PDF files?
(PERSON5) Yes, I think. 
(PERSON4) Yeah. If you can- if you can log in, uh, you can do it. 
(PERSON5) I can do it, but you can also try. 
(PERSON6) Okay, and, uh, no I just wanted to know, because I'm not well aware with the- the class settings so I just wanted to ice.
I can definitely do it, but -
(PERSON5) But you have access there, right?
Do you have access there?
(PERSON6) Yeah, I have access, yes I have access. 
(PERSON5) But you can try then, why not to try.
(PERSON6) Okay, yes, yes, I will <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) You just go there and go to this [PROJECT3], uh, folder and then -
(PERSON6) Uh-huh. 
(PERSON5) try to rename file, just remove something from the end of the file name, not the label. Use the label is important. 
(PERSON4) Okay, so -
(PERSON5) Remove a word from the end of the file name and save it.
(PERSON6) Okay, I will- I will 
do that. 
(PERSON4) [PERSON5], you suggested -
(PERSON6) I will try, if I-
(PERSON4) Uh. 
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON4) [PERSON5], you -
(PERSON5) Yes?
(PERSON4) suggested to put that in the [PROJECT1] folder or in the [PROJECT3] folder, which one?
(PERSON5) But first you should put it -
(PERSON6) [PROJECT3].
(PERSON5) in the temporary folder and then you- you should start checking them one by one.
It- if it is relevant, then you rename it, you put the label, and then you move it from the [PROJECT1] folder to the [PROJECT3]. 
Okay?
(PERSON6) Yeah, and one more thing, uh, [PERSON4], we have to also see that if it is, uh, do a final check, if it's relevant or not. 
So you're gonna do it or -
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) er, should I do it?
(PERSON5) Everyone can do it for his or her own files.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON6) Okay, so, but we don't know wha- what is a division of the papers.
So because you are going to- it's- it's -
(PERSON5) But there is no problem. 
(PERSON6) You- you gonna do for [PROJECT2] papers, that- that's finalized, but what about the other paper, how is the division gonna be like, yeah? 
(PERSON5) We divide by index.
(PERSON6) Coz I think-
(PERSON5) by index.
(PERSON4) [PERSON6] <unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) We divide by index. Until now I'm until, uh, 44. 
So from 0 to 44. 
(PERSON4) Okay, so it is fixed that [PERSON5] would do PSD, so [PERSON6] let us -
(PERSON6) Yes. 
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> the other papers like I have download, so, uh, let us _ 
(PERSON5) No, but you- you keep the same label, you keep the same label, but you just -
(PERSON4) Yeah, I will do that.
(PERSON5) add more numbers.
(PERSON4) I will do that. 
(PERSON5) Yes, so -
(PERSON4) Yeah, will do that. 
(PERSON5) from 44 to 60 or I don't know, somebody else, and then from 60 to 100 somebody else.
So we divide by index.
(PERSON6) Yeah, we can do that as well.
(PERSON5) So yes, so now please put everything in the Temp folder and remove [ORGANIZATION5], and everything else.
So I'm moving this [PROJECT1] folder inside [PROJECT3]- [PROJECT3], yes.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON4) So send me the exact part now.
(PERSON5) Okay, I will send it to you now.
<unintelligible/> 
(PERSON6) Uh, [PERSON2], I think she- she left or what?
She went to [PERSON3] to ask for us to join?
(PERSON4) Yeah, I think so. 
(PERSON2) No, I'm here all the time. 
I just -
(PERSON6) Oh. 
(PERSON2) uh, I just checked [PERSON3], <other_noise/> he was here and he, uh, has his lunch at the moment, and I ask <other_noise/> s- to call him after he comes back.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay.
<unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON4) [PERSON5], can you mute from your end maybe?
(PERSON5) Oh, yes, sorry, I donno that-
so the voice is bad, right?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) <laugh/>
(PERSON5) I just send you the link. 
(PERSON4) Yeah, I can see.
(PERSON6) So are you moving all the papers, [PERSON4]?
(PERSON4) Yeah, let me move all of them. 
(PERSON6) Okay. 
(PERSON4) Let me download it first and then I like move it -
(PERSON6) Okay. 
Just check if- if-
just try and open, because if you just download and directly upload, it will be problematic, because that, uh, entire, uh, archaic is corrupted.
So first open it and check and then upload.
So I think maybe, uh, tha- that can be an instance that, uh, your internet went well while you were uploading or something like that,
that's why the problem occurred. 
(PERSON4) Maybe.
(PERSON6) So [PERSON5], are you only t- from the [PROJECT2] or only taking the meeting summarization, uh, papers I guess, right?
(PERSON5) Uh, not just meeting.
Usually dialogue summarization.
(PERSON6) Okay, dialogue and meeting, that <unintelligible/>?
(PERSON5) Because we cannot restrict that much, otherwise we don't get papers.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so -
(PERSON5) We cannot find papers that are very- only Cloud meetings.
We have to expand little bit.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Okay, so only, uh, meeting summarization and dialogue summarization, right?
(PERSON5) Hmm, yes, dialogue is more generic, because meeting is a special type dialogue, so.
Yes, you can search with meeting summarization, dialogue summarization.
(PERSON6) Okay.
So how many papers are there in the [PROJECT2] folded for, uh, like, uh, e- in an approximation?
(PERSON5) Until now about 45.
(PERSON6) Okay.
So should we restrict the years maybe?
The number of year, uh.
(PERSON5) No.
All of them <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON6) No, we should not?
(PERSON5) in the last 20 years it's not problem.
(PERSON6) We're considering, ah, the last 20 years?
(PERSON5) Yes, the last 20 years.
(PERSON6) Maybe we can consider 10 year or so to restrict the domain.
(PERSON5) <other_yawn/> I wouldn't restrict everything, because- anything because they are few papers actually.
(PERSON6) Okay.
Okay, I think, uh, [PERSON4] will do that, uh, do we have something else to discuss today?
(PERSON4) Uh, no.
(PERSON2) So I don't have anything new from yesterday.
(PERSON6) Oh, [PERSON5]?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) And [PERSON4]?
Yeah.
(PERSON5) So I started with this, um, spreadsheet that you have.
(PERSON6) Yes, I did see the changes as well.
So I think they're more relevant.
(PERSON5) Yes.
So, can I delete your 3 lines or you are going to -
(PERSON6) Yes, I will- I will delete that.
(PERSON5) Uh, yes, and put the head there in the, uh, you know -
(PERSON6) And- uh, okay.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Yes, I will make the changes.
Yes.
(PERSON5) And one more thing.
(PERSON6) I will-
(PERSON5) When you -
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) So, uh, when you find- when you check these papers are relevant or not -
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) and decide that- yeah and you decide that one of them is relevant, -
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) first you- you put your unique label, as I showed.
You put the unique label and move it to the right folder.
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) And you should also- given that you decided to keep it, you should also find the pip tag and your best paper.
Okay?
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) The pip tag record.
And put it to the file.
(PERSON6) So one thing.
[PERSON5]?
Yes, I want to ask 1 thing.
That the way I was approaching it was I was, uh, copying the pip tag, uh, in the [ORGANIZATION2] document.
And, um, the- the label of it in the Excel sheet, so that we can easily find it, and we don't have to double- uh, do that thing.
(PERSON5) You put both, in the Excel you put both.
The label and the- uh, the record and the title of the record as I did.
You can check the Excel sheet now.
I did it for about 30 papers.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON5) You can check it now and you will see. 
(PERSON6) Okay okay.
(PERSON4) Can you forward the Excel sheet somewhere?
(PERSON6) Uh, [PERSON4], I'm shared with you.
Uh, it is called as automatic minuting.
You already have it.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) I will give it to you right now.
I will give it to you.
(PERSON6) Uh, go to your shared Excel sheets and it is there with you.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON5) Check the messages in [ORGANIZATION5], man.
<unintelligible/>
[PERSON4], you can check [ORGANIZATION5] mess connect?
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.
<unintelligible/>
Okay, so I'm <other_noise/> transferring the all the papers now.
(PERSON6) So how many are the total papers?
There.
(PERSON4) So it is gettin- it's getting transferred to the -
I don't know <unintelligible/>.
Including [PROJECT2], I think, because I moved some of the [PROJECT2]  s- papers there.
Overall there are 78.
(PERSON6) 78?
(PERSON5) No, the last go- the l- the last label I've used is 47.
So y-
(PERSON4) No, it's the papers that I -
(PERSON6) No, no, uh, [PERSON4], I think- no, no, I think, uh, there are [PROJECT2] papers as well.
If you're considering them, I think, uh, something around 70.
(PERSON4) That's what- that's what I told, that including [PROJECT2] papers it's 78.
(PERSON5) Ok, no problem.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON4) That is not the total <other_noise/> [PERSON5]?
(PERSON6) So remove the [PROJECT2] papers.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> of only meeting summarization.
(PERSON6) So I think, uh, [PROJECT2] papers are done by [PERSON5].
So besides that how many papers do we have?
(PERSON4) I have transferred it.
(PERSON5) No problem, I- I'm doing it, no problem, I have access now, I saw your -
(PERSON4) I'm gonna start to transfer?
Maybe if it's transferred -
(PERSON5) No problem, don- don't touch anything.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> and I'll check.
(PERSON5) It's still corrupted, buddy.
(PERSON4) Wonderful.
(PERSON5) Your zip is corrupted.
<other_noise/>
So y-
(PERSON4) It's transferred -
(PERSON5) [ORGANIZATION5] is messed up.
(PERSON4) Donno if it's not yet transferred, let me transfer you the full, then please open, okay?
(PERSON5) Okay, yes, it's being transferred, yes.
(PERSON6) But, uh, [PERSON4], did you check that?
By opening.
Was it opening now?
Archaic.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes, I open all the papers.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yes, I did that.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) So it's transferred.
[PERSON5], you can check.
(PERSON5) Okay.
<unintelligible/>
Okay.
Finally, it's okay.
I will upload them, no problem now, don- don't worry I think I take care of this.
(PERSON4) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON5) So you also have slides?
(PERSON6) So how many papers -
(PERSON5) You also have slides?
Yeah, some of the slides.
So it's 79 parts, but probably there are duplicates.
So I'll try to m- remove.
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON6) So maybe I think, uh, [PERSON5], just let me know that- uh, how many- after [PROJECT2]- how many papers we have.
So that, uh, we can divide <unintelligible/> first 20 or 30 I'll take and the rest remaining, uh, [PERSON4] can take.
(PERSON5) So please, uh, this division is not right.
The- the time for division.
First, you have to see the papers, relevant or not, and keep the relevant ones, label them, and then we can check the labels, and then divide them by index.
So don't worry about division right now.
First start -
(PERSON6) So maybe I think the relevance can be checked once we- whe- once we make the entries in Excel sheet.
Why to waste an extra time.
So once we are making the Excel sheet and reviewing the paper we can check if it's relevant, if it's not relevant we can just remove that.
(PERSON5) If it is relevant, you rename it, you put a label and those who put the label in Excel sheet and the pip tag, you also find the pip tag.
This is better done at the same time.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) At the same time.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON5) Okay?
So, yes.
(PERSON6) But I think, uh, first checking the relevance and renaming will take an extra effort, so
once we are revu- uh, reviewing, we can rename it and check the relevance.
If it's not relevant, we'll remove it.
(PERSON5) You don't rename it if it's not relevant, please, don't use the label if it is not relevant.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON5) First check if it is relevant.
Then use it.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so like, uh, if we divide it, I can check for 20 papers, if it's relevant, and to the rest of them, uh, [PERSON4] can do it.
(PERSON4) Maybe we can the- select some which we want to review.
And then divide.
Not random.
(PERSON6) Uh.
(PERSON5) This is what I'm saying.
Please, first check the relevance. 
If you see that it is relevant, put the right label, find the pip tag entry and put the label and the pip tag entry in the pip tag file and then Excel sheet, okay?
Then we will divide. 
Then we will see all labels, all numbers and divide by index.
Okay?
(PERSON4) So bah- the label- the labeling, are you going to do that, [PERSON5], or, uh, I- <unintelligible/> ?
(PERSON5) But you can do it, I mean.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON5) Everyone can do it. 
If you see an unlabeled paper, an unlabeled paper, you open it, you see- you read the abstract title et cetera and you should see the relevance.
If it is not relevant, leave it in template, put it in that- let me create another. 
I will create another folder Not relevant, you move it there, okay?
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) So if it is not relevant, you move it in Not relevant, if it is relevant you put there a label and move it inside [PROJECT3]. 
Okay?
And do the rest of that steps.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON5) So at the end of the process -
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON5) the [PROJECT1] folder will be empty. 
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) So [PERSON4], do you have a- full access in the cluster?
Please check it. 
(PERSON4) Yeah. 
I do that.
(PERSON5) Okay.
And then [PERSON6] should have also.
(PERSON6) Yes, I also do have.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) So I finish transferring the files. 
(PERSON4) Uh, transferring the files where? 
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON4) Where did you transfer?
(PERSON5) In the [PROJECT1] folder. 
I open them I mean.
So <other_yawn/>.
Okay, now-
so you have fiv- 50, uh, 56 56 files.
So 57, I think, 57 PDFs to be checked if they are relevant or not.
As I- yes, I explained, okay?
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
But you can find more in [ORGANIZATION1] I donno.
(PERSON2) And may I ask?
What is [PROJECT3]?
(PERSON4) I guess it stands for meeting literature?
(PERSON2) Uh-huh.
(PERSON5) Review, yes, review.
(PERSON2) Uh-huh, okay, thank you.
(PERSON4) Okay, okay, so this is the task on us, like until tomorrow we should be ready with the labels.
[PERSON6]?
Is it okay?
(PERSON6) Oh, yeah, but I cannot do for 57 papers in a day, so probably can we divide that?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON6) Thinking because I've- I have to read the ex- uh, extract to the title to check the relevance.
(PERSON5) So -
(PERSON6) I cannot -
(PERSON5) 1- 1 thing, 1 further step, please.
When you check all these titles, please go one folder back to LMR and see the titles that are already there to avoid duplicates.
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) 'Cause there could be duplicates.
So after the label, you have the title.
In [PROJECT3].
In all th- the papers in [PROJECT3].
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) So at least the beginning of the title.
So if you see duplicate, then completely delete the- uh, the file you have <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) on [PROJECT1].
Completely delete it.
Okay?
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON5) Then see the relevance and then check the- put the label and find the pip tag entry, -
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) update the Excel sheet and the- the pip tag file in the [ORGANIZATION2].
So now, [PERSON4], please, completely destroy the [ORGANIZATION5] repository.
(PERSON4) <laugh/> Yeah.
(PERSON5) Okay?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Please do it.
(PERSON4) Okay, anything else?
(PERSON6) Oh, would you divide that papers of I have to do it?
Uh, I'm not clear about <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Now you can- you can- you can do that.
I will actually go through all the papers.
(PERSON6) But I -
(PERSON4) I'll let you -
(PERSON6) No, I- because I won't be able to do it for 57 papers in a day, it is impossible. <laugh/>
(PERSON5) But you don't have to do it in a day, anyway, so.
But you better divide, but you are not forced to do it in 1 day, so.
(PERSON6) Oh, because, uh, uh, [PERSON4] mention that th- uh, till tomorrow we have to do it, so.
(PERSON5) Hmm, I wouldn't say that.
(PERSON4) So maybe, uh, maybe by the end of the week.
Then.
(PERSON6) Uh.
No, I was suggesting that, uh, we can divide the papers and then, uh, we- we can check the relevance.
Because an- I- uh, we have to do, uh, the survey, so, uh, because I'm not going to do the survey of all the 57 papers.
So let's divide that, and, uh, the papers you want to do the survey, you can analyze the relevance, and the ones which I have to do I will analyze their relevance.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) So it'll be better, yeah, because, uh, it will duplicate my task.
<other_noise/>
So maybe, uh, if they're 57 papers, you decide which you want to do, like for top 50, uh, like, uh, drop half of it or <unintelligible/>.
So it's totally your call.
(PERSON4) Yeah, I want to make first files and then decide.
(PERSON6) Uh, what?
(PERSON4) I- I want to make a first parts of the papers and then decide.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay, do let me know then.
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
Okay.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON4) Okay, <other_yawn/>, uh, what else?
(PERSON5) 1 thing to note.
You should be aware that it's not easy to find the pib tag sometimes.
(PERSON6) Oh, yeah. <laugh/>
(PERSON5) And that you should find the right pip tag, like when the paper is somewhere in [ORGANIZATION3] events, you put [ORGANIZATION3] pip tag, not the, you know, not RQ of some other pip tag.
So the official one possibly.
Okay?
(PERSON6) Yes, uh, definitely we'll consider this.
(PERSON5) I just did- I did it now for about 30 papers and it's not easy, it took me like more than 3 hours to find the pip tags.
(PERSON6) Yes, that's- uh, that's why I was, uh, thinking that, uh, t- uh, I won't be able to do for all 57 papers.
Alone.
(PERSON5) Yes.
And don't feel forced to do it until tomorrow.
You better do it properly than quickly.
(PERSON6) Yes, yes, sure.
(PERSON4) So we have at the first parts we'll just rename those files and then we will put an entry, right?
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) No.
(PERSON5) You see the relevance?
You see the relevance?
That it is relevant?
(PERSON6) So yeah, first relevance and- yeah, then rename it, otherwise, we don't need to rename it.
(PERSON5) Put- put the label, put the label, yes, otherwise, you put it- you move it in Not relevant folder.
<other_noise/>
So put the- the label, move it in the right folder, and then check the pip tag, find the pip tag online, you put the pip tag in the pip file of [ORGANIZATION2] with the comments- with the commented label as I did, and then you put the label and the pip tag index in the 2 columns of a spreadsheet.
In column A and column F.
(PERSON4) So, uh, in any of the column, uh, like who is going to review <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Sorry?
(PERSON6) Does it matter? <laugh/>
(PERSON4) Uh, I think -
(PERSON5) No, eh, th- they shouldn't- they- they like don't have to be ordered.
Y- you just put the right label and the pip tag entry.
(PERSON4) No, I think- I think there should be other column that who is going to review what.
That would be, uh, like -
(PERSON6) Like, uh, actually, uh, [PERSON5], uh, earlier I did not add that lead column
and, uh, [PERSON4] wanted that who did review this paper, so <unintelligible/> listed that any Excel sheet, so he, uh, made me <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) No, it should be- it should be easy.
No, no, no, I don't think it's <unintelligible/>.
Uh, like [PROJECT2]- up to [PROJECT2] 50 are mine, then [PROJECT2] s- 51 to 70 to 80 will be- it's easy to do and I don't need to keep it in SpreadSheet.
(PERSON4) No, but I wan- I don't want to do it then though, like if- if it is 50 to 70, it's not that I will do <unintelligible/> 70.
<unintelligible/> 70 to 90 as well, I think it'll be good.
(PERSON6) Oh.
(PERSON5) Once again, please, raise your voice, please.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so what I'm saying is it's <unintelligible/> once we label we are going to do like 50 to 70 these papers.
And I would do the 60 to 70, it's not like that.
It's like that it can be anything within that 70 which all interests.
Okay.
So that's why I said that we have to <unintelligible/> that who's going to review that.
(PERSON6) S- s- so if that interest, than how we'll be able to do it in parallel?
Uh, because you can find any paper which I'm also reading, or [PERSON5] is reading, so -
(PERSON4) Yeah, that's what- uh, that's what I said, that we should <unintelligible/>.
So okay, [PERSON6], you are going to do this, I'm not going to do this, so I will do this, but.
That's it, write your name.
You are going to do this.
(PERSON6) What?
(PERSON4) So just I can be -
(PERSON5) I cannot hear you.
(PERSON4) that you were-
(PERSON5) Please, raise your voice.
(PERSON4) I am saying just write your n- write your name against that paper which one you are going to do.
Like [PROJECT2] to 6 -
(PERSON6) No.
(PERSON5) We don't have to do it like this.
We messed up like this.
(PERSON6) Yes,
(PERSON5) We will just -
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) use a convention, a very simple convention.
[PROJECT2] 1 to [PROJECT2] 50 let's say will be reviewed by me.
[PROJECT2] 51 to 70 or 80 by somebody else from your-
we just do it like this like we set it up like this and then we are okay.
We'll see the number, the label, if it is in my interval I will do it.
If it is in your interval -
(PERSON4) So, so that means s- that- that means that [PROJECT2] 51 to 70 -
(PERSON5) Yes?
(PERSON4) are the papers that I am going to review so that I need to <unintelligible/>, right?
(PERSON5) Hmm, not right now.
First, you name them, then we divide them.
(PERSON4) So that's what  <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON5) It was just an example, it was just an example I told.
(PERSON6) But if we are going to- the division is going to be according to sequence, that what [PERSON5] means, that-
like we will -
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> in sequence, I don't think it be problem use to be in sequence.
Why it needs to be in sequence?
(PERSON6) But-
but if- if you find, uh, you pick up any paper which is interesting for you, that will be problematic.
(PERSON4) That's what I'm telling, that's what I'm telling that if you put a name, okay, it's- or it might be interesting to me, but you are doing that.
So I'm not doing that.
It's a e- as easy as that.
(PERSON6) No, it will be difficult to find all the- uh, to en- to find your entry and, uh, to get if you're also doing that same and I- I don't think it will be confusing, I-
(PERSON4) Why you think confusing?
(PERSON6) I'm not able to -
(PERSON4) You put your name.
If you put your name against that paper if you are doing that, why it would be confusing?
I'm not getting this.
(PERSON6) <laugh/> I don't know, okay, you ca- it's your call, maybe we'll- however you like you- you can decide.
(PERSON4) Yeah, that's what I told.
(PERSON5) I don't- I'm not following you.
(PERSON4) I'm doing the first -
(PERSON5) I don't understand.
(PERSON6) Yeah, [PERSON1], so, uh, [PERSON4] wants that, uh, it should not be according to sequence, okay, once we rename we check the relevance, we are done, we have a list of papers, we have a folder of papers, relevant papers, and then to divide among us, all of us,
uh, we should not choose like first 50 are done by you, the next 50 are done by me and the next 50 are done by, uh, [PERSON4], but rather he wants, uh, the division to be according to interest, so he can choose any paper which interest him.
(PERSON5) No, no, no, no, it's not possible to manage like that, we mess up, we conf- uh, there is a lot of confusion, we cannot do like that.
(PERSON4) Why?
I want to go- no, I want to know that why- why?
If you <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON5) It's very confusing, man, it's- it's very confusing.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> it's confusing.
(PERSON5) We can hardly communicate right now.
And how can we arrange?
I want this, you want that, it's not -
(PERSON4) Can't we just write in the Spreadsheet I am going to do this.
(PERSON6) But it will be really difficult, I- even I am thinking same.
How can I- how is it possible even.
(PERSON4) No, but I am not supporting this random assignment.
So.
(PERSON6) No, it's not going to be random, -
(PERSON4) This is what it is.
(PERSON6) it's gonna be a sequence, like 20- these 20 papers you gonna do, these 20 papers I am gonna do.
(PERSON4) Oh, maybe, maybe <unintelligible/> like 5 or 6 doesn't interest me.
So why, why would I do that?
(PERSON6) Okay.
<laugh/>
(PERSON4) Why would I do that?
(PERSON5) Okay, you can do it- listen, uh, the first 50 papers are already mine, okay?
Are the papers that I have printed in my desk and I have read and I started to reread.
So you can choose to divide them as you wish, okay. I just don't want confusion and waste of time, okay?
So please -
(PERSON4) Yeah, okay, you do that -
(PERSON5) label them as I said, label them as I said, I have the first 50 [PROJECT2], 49 is the last one, and then you can discuss with each other, but please no confusion and no waste of time, okay?
(PERSON4) Yeah, that's fine.
(PERSON5) If you wanna do it like that, I do this, you do that, you communicate to the other and you sort it out together.
(PERSON4) Yeah, it's o- it's absolutely okay.
Yeah, it's absolutely okay.
So it's- it's also possible that like reading the top 50 that you have reviewed, I may be interest in some of them, so I- and in any way I am going to review that.
(PERSON5) You- yes, you can read them.
Nobody forbids you to read the paper.
You can read that, of course.
(PERSON4) So it's like
(PERSON5) Sure, yes, okay.
(PERSON4) Okay, so, we have less than a minute.
(PERSON6) So in that case whatever, wha- yeah, so whatever in that case, uh, do let me know which papers I have to do because I'm really confused and, uh, I have stopped the work since last 2 months of the survey, so I'm really stuck with it, and if you do that let me know which papers I have to review, I will do that.
So whatever you decide.
Just let me know which papers I have to review because I am waiting for your call, eh, since, uh, a month, and, uh, if y- if you decide which papers you want to review and which I have to review, I'll be glad to know that.
(PERSON4) No, I didn't get this like you were waiting for my call, <unintelligible/> that you get this -
(PERSON6) Yeah, because you said that you want to do it according to the interest,
and, uh, which paper interest you I don't know <laugh/> that and, uh -
(PERSON4) Yeah, so that paper has not been uploaded, right.
(PERSON6) So, uh, you can read that paper, you can read that paper if that interest you, but, uh, uh, making an entry in Excel sheet is- is not understandable by me, that if some- some, uh, paper interest you, you are going to do that entry and, uh, I don't have to do that or what I- I'm really not, uh, able to understand the idea that which paper are interesting you, you- you're going to do that survey.
(PERSON4) So, I'm not going to do a random review, like 50 to 70, so that is for sure.
And, yeah.
(PERSON5) Now you have the- the lead- you have the lead column in the spreadsheet, you can put the names there, so from [PROJECT2] 0 to to es- [PROJECT2] 49 are already labeled, I don't put my name there, there is no need for name there in these papers.
(PERSON5) To the files that you have <unintelligible/> and then move them one by one to [PROJECT3].
If you read and see that there is an GitHub link with code somewhere you move it instead in- with code folder.
If it is not relevant you put it to Not relevant folder
so at the end of the process you should <unintelligible/> you should remove all the files from the Temp folder and delete them as not as the duplicates, either put them in Not relevant
or just put them in [PROJECT3] with the right label.
Okay?
(PERSON4) Yes, okay, so thanks, I have to -
(PERSON5) And -
(PERSON4) move for conference. 
(PERSON5) And also- and also find the pip tag- and also find the pip tag and put it in the [ORGANIZATION2]. 
And at the same time, so it's- it's a kind of, uh, little bit complex, because you <unintelligible/> also update the Excel sheet. 
As I did with the 2 columns, the paper column and, uh, and, uh, reference column.
So you once again put the label and, uh, paper, and put the pip tag record title in the author reports.
(PERSON4) Yes, I- yeah, I- I- I- I got that process, so I have to move for that conference, so -
(PERSON2) Just may I- may I have a little remark, please?
Uh, -
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON2) I tried to listen to you and I, uh, fixed something, uh, um, <unintelligible/> most of that discussion uh, into the agenda that we had, uh, made yesterday. 
Maybe I sent you the link- maybe if you, uh, look at this organizing process I have
tried it to- try, uh, try to fix it, uh, up.
Uh, so it should be there.
If you just- if you can use it somehow.
Did you get what I meant <laugh/> I just said it a little bit a me- in a messy way. 
The idea is that I fix the procedure of, um, organizing the paper proposed by [PERSON5], uh, in, uh, the agenda and I sent you the link.
Wait.
(PERSON5) Didn't get this. 
What was the <unintelligible/>?
(PERSON2) Nothing, that I have just written it down if you need, uh, to have it fixed somewhere.
(PERSON5) What is this fixed somewhere, what is it about?
(PERSON2) Uh, I opened a link, sent you note at the chat. 
(PERSON5) To the [ORGANIZATION1] Hangout?
(PERSON2) Uh, no, to [ORGANIZATION4] chat, but I can also send it to, uh, [ORGANIZATION1] Hangout. 
Uh, I- I have sent it now.
(PERSON4) Okay, so.
(PERSON5) I- I don't have access here, how can I can- how can I get access here in this?
(PERSON2) Uh, ask me for access probably, if you can't open it please ask me for the- for access.
(PERSON5) So yes, I ask for access.
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON4) I will- I will- I will take a leave.
(PERSON5) So I sent the request now what.
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm, uh, just- just moment, uh, it take some time. 
Uh, I am working on it. 
(PERSON2) Take sure like, um, you two follow this <other_noise/> I send it. 
Uh, because if we are recording the calls I would use it as- for our dataset.
And if I use it for our dataset, I want to have some agenda or minutes.
So it's about this call that is being recorded, right?
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON5) And you record them, right?
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON5) Okay.
But you record them in [ORGANIZATION4]- you record them in [ORGANIZATION4] or also in [ORGANIZATION1] meet?
(PERSON2) In [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON5) Only in [ORGANIZATION4]?
(PERSON2) Only in [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON2) So now, uh, uh, can you see that now?
(PERSON5) Yes, I can see the document. 
So what's the problem?
(PERSON2) No, I have, uh, no problem.
I have just said that I have fixed out the organizing <other_noise/> and probably you would like to control it or to, uh, make it more detailed so that you can use it when working with paper. 
But you- you should not- I just, uh, claim that I did it.
(PERSON5) Okay, it's fine.
(PERSON2) So if you see that organized papers for this survey proposed by [PERSON5] should be done
by one of the authors to <unintelligible/> duplication.
Work with papers in [PROJECT3] folder and the address. 
Do not label papers which are not relevant if it -
(PERSON5) <other_yawn/>
(PERSON2) <other_noise/> put it in Not relevant folder. 
So just like that.
(PERSON5) Okay, okay.
(PERSON2) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON6) So, uh, [PERSON5], I'm really confused till now.
What I have to do?
Because -
(PERSON5) I can explain it to you.
(PERSON6) It is not possible.
(PERSON5) I can explain it to you again.
So -
(PERSON6) The procedure, I know.
 The procedure I know, -
(PERSON5) Yes. 
(PERSON6) but if- if this- if we implement this idea that, uh, I- I wou- I am going to pick up any paper and I am going to do, uh, uh, the entry in the Excel sheet, -
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) then, uh, like <other_noise/>  what will be the- w- like I will be keep on doing that and which one will be done by, uh, [PERSON4], I- I'm totally confused, the idea I did- uh, like the idea y- of your division.
Maybe first 15, second 50 or I donno.
(PERSON5) Well, what can I say?
<laugh/> What can I say.
(PERSON6) Now this is- this is really confusing, I- I- I- I'm really, uh, -
(PERSON5) You will just, uh, put the names, put the names in the lead column and if you see that it has the name of [PERSON4] you won't touch it, otherwise you put your name and you do it.
(PERSON6) Okay.
I- okay, I will, uh, follow the procedure which is classified by you and I think [PERSON2] has also documented it, so there is no, uh, confusion into it.
(PERSON5) Yeah, so p- please, uh, remember to remove this, uh, first 5 6 lines in the Excel sheet, or kind of put them down and- because it doesn't look, uh, really good now with this extra roll.
(PERSON6) Yes, yes, let me -
(PERSON5) Yeah, so -
(PERSON6) let me remove them.
So I have to make an -
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) uh, <unintelligible/> because I reviewed it, so I- I'm going to make the specific entries a- accordingly? 
(PERSON5) Uh, yes, if you already did it you can- you can move them down, you can move them down.
(PERSON6) Yes.  
(PERSON5) But you first have to label them, you have to label the papers.
(PERSON6) Yes. 
(PERSON5) Yeah, so you should start by these 3 papers. 
Do first these 3 papers, labeling them, -
(PERSON6) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON5) and adapting the- the columns as I did down there, you know like.
Okay?
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON5) So I guess that's it for today. 
(PERSON6) Uh-huh. 
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) So we can leave now. 
Yes?
(PERSON6) Yes, yes.
(PERSON5) Okay.
(PERSON2) Yeah, thank you, bye-bye. 
(PERSON5) Goodbye, bye.
(PERSON6) Thank you, goodbye.
