 WP updates (time permitting, but please write details here in any case)
 WP1 Data
 Domain adaptation data is being collected
 From the winter term, [ORGANIZATION6] should start collecting student interpreters' recordings from their regular training sessions; transcripts however won't be available.
 WP2 ASR
 [ORGANIZATION6] in close contact with the Speech group from Brno, [PERSON8] to spend the summer there, learning how to use Kaldi get a decent Czech model.
 WP3 SLT
 [ORGANIZATION4] - Experimenting with incremental MT, initially treating MT system as a black box, and using an agent which is able to request source words. The MT system is able to rewrite. Questions are, how should MT system decide whether to output or delay, how often the MT system revises the output, and what causes revisions. Effect of these revisions on user experience would also be interesting.
 WP4 MT
 [ORGANIZATION6]: Multi-target experiments still stalled (the student not working).
 [ORGANIZATION6]: A number of WMT papers (systems, test suites) related to doc-level eval.
 [ORGANIZATION6] will hopefully have another summer intern to experiment with some multi-source.
 [ORGANIZATION4]: an ACL paper submitted on document-level MT
 [ORGANIZATION4]: ongoing experiments on model capacity for multilingual MT (and an ACL submission on deep MT models)
 WP5 Minuting
 Updating the NITE XML Toolkit and working on the conversion from our gathered meetings into NXT Tool, so that manual annotation can start.
 A summer intern to arrive on June 28 to sketch the first ideas for the models.
 WP6 Integration
 Prototype of Presentation Platform up and running, but we still require time to test on different browsers and operating systems. We need also to perform stress tests and multiple flows publications tests. Stillo working also on subtitle presentation (charset, font size and so on).
