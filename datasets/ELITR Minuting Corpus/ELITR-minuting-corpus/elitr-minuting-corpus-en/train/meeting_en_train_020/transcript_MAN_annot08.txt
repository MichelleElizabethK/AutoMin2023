(PERSON3) In the in your in your uhm [ORGANIZATION2] sheets, 
so after <unintelligible/> done discussing that point is you want to discuss today.
I without I with want to discuss about the <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Uhm. 
Uhm for yes.
Oh, that's this maybe we can discuss that proposal now when [PERSON1] is not here. 
And as she joins we will  discuss everythings.
(PERSON3) No I think let she would be required, 
because  <unintelligible/> especially the especially the evaluation aspect.
Uhm.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) Make we need we need to discuss.
So that is that is important. 
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) I would <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Yes. 
Uhm.
Did-
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> for [PERSON1] and then start. 
(PERSON4) Yes, 
this is also the topic I wanted to discuss with you today.  
Uhm the evaluation preparation,
so who is do it on what?
And uhm [PERSON5] uhm proposed that we make like that shared task imitation.
I can I don't know if [PERSON3] [PERSON3] can you see the agenda?
Could you open an agenda, please?
Because there is the description of these shared task imitation  in there are tasks for you to. 
(PERSON3) I don't have the link of agenda. 
Can you write it in the chat list?
(PERSON4) Yes, 
I'll write it in the chat.
Othervise it is always in the  description of our meeting in Zi- in [ORGANIZATION2] in [ORGANIZATION1].
Uhm, like I will uhm.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> so.
(PERSON4) Yes, in the meeting invite.
(PERSON2) Yeah. 
(PERSON4) I <unintelligible/> this works.
This is-
it contains the work <unintelligible/> again, 
the word share and you again. 
Is it work?
Uhm.
(PERSON2) This could be uhm [PERSON4] if you can put the links in the Hangout chat,
so that link's still there?
(PERSON4) Hangouts chat this is what? 
[ORGANIZATION2] meet?
(PERSON2) Yeah,
you know in the in the Hangouts chat in that Gmail chat that we are-
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON2) Coffee. 
(PERSON4) Yes, I yes I understand.
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah. 
(PERSON4) Oh, okay. 
Just a moment. 
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> the word the link would be gone so it's better late with <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Just a moment.
Is it work?
<laugh/>
Yes.
Sorry.
[PERSON1] is not here.
I have written her through [ORGANIZATION2],
through Hangouts and she didn't react.
Uhm, Hangouts claims that she <unintelligible/> three years ago. 
(PERSON2) Okay.
So [PERSON4] maybe you would want to start this <unintelligible/> maybe?
(PERSON4) Yes,
but well it's actually pitty that uhm [PERSON1] is not here,
because I had to I wanted to discuss the tasks with her.
Almost  primal- primary they actually.
Uhm but maybe before she comes we could start with uhm so uhm this is some share task issues?
And uhm uhm maybe you have it already clear,
but this maybe this is just my question to you that I want to make it clear.
Uhm do you know uhm so I just thought about uhm the tasks that we give to share task
and its evaluations in general, 
because I know so I have so I have seen the list list of tasks this A to D,
but uhm I just <unintelligible/>
and if we give task task see <unintelligible/> a main one, 
which I considered to view logical and good,
uhm we have uhm we have to so we work on evaluation
and all of it is uhm contains a lot of problems 
and a lot of unsolved issues.
So all evaluation will be subjective,
anyway it's not so it's clear.
And we should work on it,
it's also clear 
and we should kind of devi- explicitly know who is working on what 
and if so [PERSON1] if uhm <unintelligible/> documented [PERSON3] prepare it uhm does it mean that [PERSON3] is able to makes some kind of subjective 
and <unintelligible/> evaluation at this moment, 
or should it be developed uhm more
and the next question is who is going to developed? 
And uhm for other measures who is <unintelligible/> at the moment. 
So this is one question
and the second question is shared tasks are es- kind of easier tasks that uhm now I just  started over 
and I think it is also good to put this easier task,
maybe do can- connect A and B together,
maybe not.
So it's uhm on us 
but for this tasks we have clear evaluation evaluation.
Isn't that.
It just yes and no, 
and we we know what is yes
and what is no. 
Is it so?
And do do understand it correctly?
I should just just want to make it clear picture of what is going on.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so that that's what was in my mind.
[PERSON4] <unintelligible/>  because you mentioned  at some <unintelligible/> time of <unintelligible/> even I <unintelligible/> give two minutes belongs to just same tasks <unintelligible/>  it's difficult.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON2) So I-
(PERSON4) This is- uhm.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so I thought that if could be one filer sub- subtask
uhm that we would want our participant <unintelligible/> list
and yes it it would be definitely <unintelligible/> plus we <unintelligible/> that okay is is it is it belongs?
Yes, or no?
So.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
So I think we should definitely included,
because this is what we can provide at least some evaluation for.
And-
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON4) And this is the task what should we also discussed with [PERSON1].
She began to work on.
So my original task I gave to [PERSON1] was uhm to work on distinguishing <unintelligible/> belonging to the same same minutes 
or belonging to different uhm belonging to same meetings or belonging to different minu- meetings.
So she uhm sure original task was to define this point, 
and she already worked on that, 
and she had some results.
So maybe we could uhm 
at least now we can know what it what was it for.
And to use your experiments for these measurement 
or for as a sys-   is one of this system.
So kind of organizing uh-huh.
And uhm yes, 
iii is it is it okay and is it clear?
Is it so am I consider and correctly?
The same is you do?
(PERSON2) Yes, uhm so uhm [PERSON4] can you  make just write then email to [PERSON1] maybe?
If it is possible, 
because I think these discussions uhm like-
she she should she should be <unintelligible/>,
because she she has worked on this.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes. 
Definitely.
(PERSON2) So she should have more idea than I.
(PERSON4) She doesn't she doesn't uhm answer yeah now.
I don't know. 
[PERSON1] <unintelligible/> again.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> 
<parallel_talk/>
(PERSON2) Uhm don't se that's that's
(PERSON4) <parallel_talk/>
Oh I have sent your an email,
should we postpone our meeting if you really need [PERSON1]?
I don't know. 
<laugh/>
She doesn't <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) I really think that she should be here, 
but otherwise you have to repeat the same thing again.
So-
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
(PERSON2) There is <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Other is uhm <unintelligible/> all my two days topics concern [PERSON1], 
that's why I don't know  what to <unintelligible/> this.
(PERSON2) Okay.
