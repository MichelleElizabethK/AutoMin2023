(PERSON10) Hello.
(PERSON6) Hello.
(PERSON10) Yeah, sorry for the delay and sorry for)  being <unintelligible/> again ehm –
so it's like on – on a more comlicated ehm connection.
ehm Due to the ehm limitations of the connection, I don't really want to ehm be ehm with you for the whole – ehm for the whole thirty minutes,
ehm so ehm I just wanted to ask you if you contribute to the document.
I see that [PERSON8] has done it, ehm [PERSON3] is still working on the ehm paper, great, and [PERSON6] is here.
that – that's good.
ehm So ehm this is ehm a rare opportunity ehm for you to ehm talk directly ehm to [PERSON6] ehm from – ehm from September.
When we restart this calls we will find a date, which is – time, which is suitable also for [PERSON6].
So [PERSON6] is, as you know, ehm working on the ehm  [PROJECT3] test set and he was supposed to have colleague who would supervise the annotators, but just yesterday ehm the colleague ehm set that she –
due to heath reasons she cannot ehm join ehm us.
ehm So we're still searching for someone ehm to ehm help with the supervision of annotators.
(PERSON6) mmhm Yes, I have an idea.
(PERSON10) Yeah?
(PERSON7) ehm I – ehm I – I wanted to find such person and I don't know about the – the other annotators, but ehm the one who – who did the English ehm anno- anno- annotations – [ANNOTATOR1].
(PERSON10) mmhm
(PERSON6) ehm I think she also speaks several languages and maybe she could <unintelligible/> it.
I don't want whether she wants to, but I'd think she is a reliable person to the – to such thing.
(PERSON10) Yes, so, definitely ask ehm if she would like to do that, ehm because we need some supp- ehm some – some help ehm with that.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON10) So I don't want to spend ehm too much money on like growing the ehm test set too big or – or ehm to ehm like – ehm polish it accessively,
ehm but still it's definitely not in the shape where we would want to ehm – to leave it.
So we definitely need some – ehm some support.
So if we'll not be like he would work and not work till the end of the project, but it will be some work and we need a person for that, so, please ask, that – that's great.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay.
(PERSON10) ehm Okay, ehm so ehm m- [PERSON3] is working on the paper, that's – that's good, ehm and PERSON9 is –
I – I saw the subtitle submission, thank you, ehm and ehm –
yes, okay, ehm the substitute for ehm – for [PERSON9], that's ehm fine,
and ehm most probably any results until deadline –
so w- ehm –
you mean no results for calling, or do you – do you expect [PERSON8] to have – to have anything for – for calling?
(PERSON8) Yes, I have nothing for calling.
No r- no results.
(PERSON10) Yeah, ehm well, the- that's life, ehm so if you still find something, that would be great, but obviously ehm there will be other conferences, so don't – ehm don't worry.
(PERSON8) Okay.
(PERSON10) ehm Yeah, thank you,
ehm and ehm we also have ehm [PERSON9] in the call,
ehm so [PERSON9], do you have the link to the document ehm that we are always –
<other_noise/>
(PERSON9) Sorry – sorry I have some problems, can you repeat it?
(PERSON10) Do you have the link to the document that we are always editting?
The  [PROJECT3] Surge –
(PERSON9) Yes, yes, I – I have opened it.
(PERSON10) Yeah, okay, yeah, so – so – ehm so, please, just add what – you have been working on or your state exam is over, or is it still going to happen?
(PERSON9) ehm That's actually the reason, why [PERSON8] is substituting me,
(PERSON10) Okay <laugh/>.
(PERSON9) because I – I have –
they –
I have always <unintelligible/>, so –
(PERSON10) Yeah, okay, clear.
All clear, <laugh/> yeah, so that's ehm –
I'll – I'll keep my fingers crossed for that, because <parallel_talk/> Thank you. <parallel_talk/> unfortunately for the defence date, which is the same date ehm –
(PERSON9) It's a day before. <unintelligible/>
(PERSON10) Yeah, so on neither of these days I'll be in [LOCATION1] ehm, I still have to actually write the – ehm the positive review for your ehm thesis, but ehm then someone will read it and it should be [PERSON1] <unintelligible/>.
ehm So ehm that's ehm – yeah, that's ehm what I remember.
I wanted to –
I remember one thing and that is from [PERSON2],
ehm because [PERSON2] would still seek someone, who would implement the user interface, some simple ehm annotation tool ehm for the minuting annotation.
And I know that [PERSON9] had many thoughts about it, ehm but then ehm obviously you were busy with ehm the – the systems, the thesis, now the state exams –
ehm in the summer, would you like to ehm wo- would you have time to work on this and would you like to?
Or are we kind of in the search for another person?
(PERSON9) I am still planning to work on that.
(PERSON10) Okay, yeah, so the – so that's – that's good.
So if you are planning that's – that's great, so that – that will be –
I think ehm you are in the best position to do that,
ehm but ehm still ehm I ehm –
yeah, I just wanted to ehm – to say that [PERSON2] is now ehm in the s- in the situation where we would – where she would ehm like to have the tool,
but I'll –
like state exam is the – is ehm a very good excuse.
(PERSON9) Okay.
(PERSON10) <laugh/> ehm So ehm I –
how about the <unintelligible/> –
oh, great, <laugh/>, do we have a meeting to work crazy?
Yes!
So, ehm that's ehm a very good remark from [PERSON8] ehm and it ehm also considers [PERSON9],
so, I'm – I'll try to find the slot, and I'll – I'll be –
I assume, [PERSON9], you are available ehm anytime, but ehm actually you should not ehm like spend any time ehm with our things than – than learning, right?
(PERSON9) It would be better for me, yeah, if I could connect remotely.
(PERSON10) Yes, yes, yes.
ehm So I'll try ehm to ehm find ehm some slots tomorrow or on Thursday, ehm because we need to discuss some [ORGANIZATION3] grant and that – that ehm considers PERSON9 and you as well, and [ANNOTATOR1] and [PERSON4].
So that's like a foreseen – ehm foreseen thing,
and thanks for the reminder, that's – that's very good ehm one.
(PERSON6) I'm sorry, ehm we're also supposed to have a meeting together tomorrow, ehm –
(PERSON10) Yes.
(PERSON6) Will you be a- available?
(PERSON10) Yes.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON10) Yes, that holds, ehm so I –
maybe a time <unintelligible/> little late, because at 8:30 I will be collecting something at Plzeňská street and then I'll get to [ORGANIZATION1] ehm,
<parallel_talk/> mmhm Okay. <parallel_talk/>, but the – otherwise ehm it – it should be fine.
Yeah, and I have [PERSON11] for 9:30,
so I'll – I – I hope not to be late <laugh/>.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay.
(PERSON10) ehm Yeah.
So ehm from my ehm point of view ehm s-
<typing/> <unintelligible/>
from my point of view I don't have anything ehm on you, because I need to review all the deliverables and make sure that they are d- d- done and ehm,
so ehm I'm ehm overloaded with this.
And then ehm obviously with some ehm exams ehm co- correction of – of the exams.
ehm And [PERSON4], yeah.
<typing/>
Okay, so , that's probably ehm <unintelligible/> yeah, great.
So I think that's – that's everything from – ehm from me and if you don't have anything extra urgent, then ehm –
I would like to ask someone to stay on the call just in case others come late for the remaining 19 minutes,
ehm but if no one comes, then I think we're – ehm we're done.
Do the idea ehm, as you see, is that over the summer ehm everybody should be working their hours,
th- those that you ehm are ehm being paid for or if you are on the flexible hours ehm then ehm whatever is needed.
ehm And –
But we don't have –
we won't have these – ehm these calls,
and we will start them ehm with ehm September.
ehm Yeah, so, that's ehm –
as far as I ehm can think this is – that's everything I wanted to say,
so, when you are not working, then enjouy summer.
It's summer day today.
Hopefully it will remain for a while and hopefully will be not too hot and too dry and – and – <unintelligible/> again.
Yeah, okay.
So, if ehm – if you don't have anything –
(PERSON5) Hi, it's [PERSON5] here.
(PERSON10) Yes, okay, hi [PERSON5].
() PERSON9, he's labeled like [PERSON8].
(PERSON5) Yeah, I'm using [PERSON8]'s –
so ehm I – I – don't have task – I don't have tasks this week.
(PERSON10) mmhm
(PERSON5) Probably) today PERSON9 has gave) me <unintelligible/> recognition to keep the work on –
ehm I think that's the –
well, yeah, that's <unintelligible/>
(PERSON10) mmhm You have – you have the big summer task and the big summer task is to clean the start fol- the starting folder.
(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah yeah, the – the <unintelligible/> of the <unintelligible/> control instead your <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON10) Yeah, the <unintelligible/> control, clean-up of the <unintelligible/> control.
So, whenever you s- your mind says I don't have anything to do, then this is a big thing and you need to chip it ehm off like ehm bit by bit,
ehm slowly clean clean it up.
ehm There is one thing that the demo – the demo session that we had for the project officer ehm –
so actually <unintelligible/> everybody after this, I'm sure.
ehm The demo technically went very well,
ehm but the ehm response is that the quality still needs to be improved.
So, <laugh/>, so the users are ehm – like they were happy about the way the demo was presented ehm and technically everything worked perfectly.
ehm But the quality of all the components is ehm below what they find usable for practice.
So there is a r- request for everyone ehm to work on their systems ehm, add data, re-train ehm everything.
ehm And ehm I'm talking about the demo because I ehm wanted to ehm mention –
and especially in front of [PERSON5], ehm that tehre will be one more ehm such demo session, when we ehm organise it,
and it's – it will be user and advisory board, that something – ehm some colleagues ehm in the field, so not ehm officers from the [ORGANIZATION2], but technical ehm colleagues.
ehm And we promised to have a meeting last year, but we forgot.
So we are now ehm trying to find a date ehm and we will show them ehm essentially the same demo plus ehm any presentations on any other ehm work-package in ehm – in  [PROJECT3].
So this is ehm f- warning.
Please, keep the demo as it is, don't break it,
ehm but ehm do the polishing ehm in a new holder or whatever.
And  ehm we have a person ehm who is going to ehm be in the similar position that you are [PERSON5], once you leave,
and I'm trying to get the – ehm the biggest overlap between ehm him and you.
ehm And hopefully he'll agree, hopefully he'll join us.
ehm And ehm then ehm you'll have ehm immediately th- due to your explaining evetyrhing ehm to – ehm to this person.
So I – I cannot th- confirm that for 100% yet, but ehm we have selected him and we have notified him, so hopefully he'll <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Okay, <unintelligible/>
(PERSON10) Yeah.
Okay, so, now that's –
ehm yeah, so may- maybe someone could quickly take notes of what I said about the demo and the review of the demo for the  [PROJECT3] and advisory board.
So I'll – I'll – yeah.
<typing/>
<unintelligible/>
ehm demo and <unintelligible/> users not quite happy,
ehm and then ehm
<unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
Okay, so that's it.
I have other things to do and I have to drive back to [LOCATION1], ehm so ehm I'll – I'll leave now myself,
but please someone for – ehm for the remaining ehm few minutes, until – ehm until half past 4.
Okay, right.
Is that everything from everybody?
(PERSON5) Thank you.
(PERSON6) Thank you [PERSON10].
(PERSON9) Thank you.
(PERSON10) So, thank you very much, enjoy the summer, as I said, except, obviously, when you have to work.
Thank you, bye bye!
