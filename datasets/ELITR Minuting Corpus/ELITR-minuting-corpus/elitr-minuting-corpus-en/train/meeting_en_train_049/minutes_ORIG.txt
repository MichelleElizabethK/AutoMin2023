o TODO
• Double check language streams matchings before test with [PERSON5]
• Test with [PERSON5]. Here is [PERSON5]'s assessment:
o [URL1]
• Better translation quality than last time, no ‘birds'.
• A longer segment still very hard to read (also, it disappeared).
• The blinking light gray is hard to follow, too much flicker.
• In sum: not perfect but can in principle kind of read what it is about.
• (The bureaucratic content makes it somewhat hard to assess.)
o  [URL2]
• harder to read than the previous one
• some non sense-sequence of staff, other sentences are fluent 
• the translation probably missed the point of the talk, it's hard to tell the topic of the talk
• it translate also the name of the person si [PERSON8]
• she's available to have a look at translations if we send them
o TODO: from geman to english test: [URL]
• Agree on the next test slot: tomorrow at 11:00
