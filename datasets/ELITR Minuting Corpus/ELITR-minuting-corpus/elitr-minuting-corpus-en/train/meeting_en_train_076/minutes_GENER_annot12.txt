[PROJECT2] PRE PROJECT


DATE: 5th April 2018


PARTICIPANTS: [PERSON20], [PERSON18], [PERSON19], [PERSON2], [PERSON16], [PERSON6], [PERSON13]


GOAL: Preparation for [ORGANIZATION14] 


ACTION ITEMS:


Project name
* [PROJECT2] sounds better than [PROJECT1]


WP1 - data
* [ORGANIZATION13] or [ORGANIZATION5] may be in charge (still not decided), [ORGANIZATION14] is out


task 1.1: Data for Speaker and Accent Adaptation
* goal is to record and process data from respeakers for non-native ASR
* [ORGANIZATION12] will be in charge of ASR, have knowhow 
* [ORGANIZATION13] will record respeakers from [LOCATION1] and purchase material 


Speech data person months
* [PERSON18] invites  [ORGANIZATION12] and [ORGANIZATION5] to estimate numbers of person months
* Respeaking sessions will be real to maintain authenticity of speech
* [PERSON18] invites [ORGANIZATION12] to check if recording time is sufficient for ASR
* there will be several native [OTHER5] sessions, before, during and after the conference


task 1.2: Crawling external resources for MT and SLT
* ASR will rely on available data sets, no new sets will be created
* [ORGANIZATION12] in charge of polishing existing data sets for MT
task 1.3: collecting data for minuting
* [ORGANIZATION13] will gather recordings of online meetings, manually revise transcripts 
* collect agendas and minutes and make it a data set and post-training sets


WP2 - ASR
task 2.1: robust acoustic modelling
* goal is to improve robustness, focus on accents
task 2.3: Lifelong Learning During Deployment
* [ORGANIZATION12] will gather frequent keywords in [ORGANIZATION6], the system will improve over time
* goal is to improve ASR to increase performance in all tasks
* deliverables: [PERSON18] recommends to report monthly
* [PERSON19] says WP2's timing will be similar to WP3 (will be done over the whole time)


WP3 - SLT (leader- [ORGANIZATION5])
Task 3.1: ASR Transcript Normalization
* goal is to do ASR output and MT system together
Task 3.2: Robust Neural Machine Translation with Noisy input
* goal is to make MT systems more robust towards noisy input to mantain quality
Task 3.3: End-to-end Speech-to-text Translation
* needs the most research
* goal is to avoid having separate ASR and MT systems
Deliverables: 3 prototypes, cca 1 per year
* 1st prototype - transcript normalization
* 2nd prototype - end-to-end speech
* 3rd prototype - text translation systems
* needs to be aligned with integration


Experimental set of languages
* focus on business-oriented languages that allow dissemination
* [ORGANIZATION6] should provide input
* [PERSON18] suggests [OTHER2] and [OTHER6]
* [ORGANIZATION6] is on [OTHER5] and [OTHER4], but is open to other languages 
* User interface can be easily updated with other languages 
* [PERSON16] suggests [OTHER1] and other frequently used languages
* [PERSON16] would go for [OTHER8] if possible, but ok with what is for now
* everyone agrees [OTHER6] should be removed, despite being [ORGANIZATION3] language


WP4 - Multi-lingual MT
Task 4.1: Baseline MT Models
* planned at very early stage, urgent
* goal is to be used to test the integration
* [PERSON18] invites [ORGANIZATION12] and [ORGANIZATION5] to modify wording if needed
* 1st purpose is for events, 2nd purpose for the after research 
* [ORGANIZATION3] languages is a must
Task 4.2: Document level translation
* addresses both speech and text
Task 4.3: Multi-target MT
* translation into all 43 languages needs to be prepared for the conference
Task 4.4: Multi-source MT
* goal is to gain in translation quality with more source languages
Task 4.5: Flexible multilingual MT
* focused on any subset of the languages at once
* no deliverables yet, will be baseline MT models and yearly reports


WP5 - Automatic Minuting
Task 5.4: Sequence to structure
* goal is to reduce transcript to fit the agenda structure
Task 5.5: Live minutes platform ([ORGANIZATION13] and [ORGANIZATION6])
* either plug-in for [ORGANIZATION1] Docs or offline baseline mode with summary by email
* another possibility is an extension of [ORGANIZATION6] platform 
* [PERSON16] explains it's a difficult task and requires a lot of workforce, would be very basic
* [PERSON18] suggests to investigate online solutions the 1st year, implement it the 2nd year 
* extended research will be necessary to find solutions and eventual complications 
* If [ORGANIZATION6] finds it not feasible, will go for fallback solution such as baseline mode 
* it's important to decide on the platform to be used for the demonstrator 1st year
* [ORGANIZATION6] will add content to the task 5.5 on Monday


WP6 - Integration of Systems
Task 6.2: integration with the Unified Communication platform
* [ORGANIZATION6] will add description to be ready for [ORGANIZATION14]
Task 6.3: integration of Automatic Minuting
* 5.5 will become 6.3
* [ORGANIZATION11] involved in transcript generation
Task 6.1: integration of ASR, SLT and MT
* SLT and MT will be done between [ORGANIZATION11] and [ORGANIZATION6] for each, online and live meetings 


WP7 - Dissemination
* [PERSON18] invites [ORGANIZATION6] to populate the tasks with specific activities
Task 7.1: Workshop on NLP technologies
* best part to promote benefits of the technologies
* feedback is crucial to find out what the demand is
* [ORGANIZATION6] should rather participate in the workshop, should also precise person months
* annual reports on the dissemination are a must to justify the costs


WP8 - Management
* public project website and updates deliverable will be moved to WP7
* [ORGANIZATION6] will add corresponding tasks


TO-DO LIST
* everyone will read objectives and mention at least 2 partners
* methodology needs to be polished
* [ORGANIZATION12] will review remote conferencing
* [ORGANIZATION12] or [ORGANIZATION5] will review missing SoA in ASR 
* [ORGANIZATION13] will finish SoA in MT, [ORGANIZATION5] will review it
* [ORGANIZATION13] will review SoA on SLT
* [ORGANIZATION12] will review SoA on Summarization
* [ORGANIZATION6] will review SoA on minuting tools
* everyone will review handling humans and expected impacts
* [ORGANIZATION6] will populate the dissemination WP, should be specific on social media and press activities
* [PERSON18] invites all to suggest anything reasonable for the [ORGANIZATION2] budget


Next call: Next week
