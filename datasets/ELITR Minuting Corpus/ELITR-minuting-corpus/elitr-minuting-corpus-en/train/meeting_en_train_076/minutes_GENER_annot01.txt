[PROJECT2] Pre-project meeting 2018
Fri, May 04, 2018
time and place?
Attendees: [ORGANIZATION13], [ORGANIZATION12], [ORGANIZATION5], [ORGANIZATION6], ?
The purpose: To familiarize attendees with individual work-packages, to discuss the division of labor and tune some details about the project

An update on [ORGANIZATION14] status
● A partner in the B part, in the actual application 3rd part, linked through other partners 
● A separate columns in the budget draft especially for [ORGANIZATION14] - later included in total afterward
● Technically, standalone partner contributing a few person-months

Leadership of work-packages
● [ORGANIZATION13] - multilingual MT, management and probably also keeps minuting
● [ORGANIZATION5] will lead data work-package

Involvement on partners in the integration work-package 6
● Everybody to check and provide input till tomorrow to draft should be completed

Deliverables 
● Publishing platform - software and report (not confirmed yet)
● Other events after the [ORGANIZATION3] event for month 32 - a report about running

Milestones
● first engine integrated with the platform
● first preparatory event at [ORGANIZATION14]
● Unified communication platform integrated - could also be deliverable, it's on the agreement between [ORGANIZATION6] and [ORGANIZATION11]
● [ORGANIZATION3] event - also deliverable - a report in the form of journal paper describing technical aspects of the running the event
● Automatic minuting integrated with platform - first version

The project name
● Probably [PROJECT2] - nicer content and spelled-out version

Presentation of the respective work-packages by work-package leaders - at first to decide who leads which WP
WP1 - Data
The data for speaker and accent adaptation
● [ORGANIZATION12] - the leading partner
● A budget contribution - [ORGANIZATION12] and [ORGANIZATION5] to consider:
● Number of demanded hours per speaker, number of speakers for recordings - adaptation purposes and presence at the conferences
External resources for MT and SLT
● A new data will be created only for the ASR adaptation
● [ORGANIZATION12] to add tasks and [ORGANIZATION5] to estimate the number of devoted person-months
 Collecting minuting data
● To gather existing online meetings and manually revise the transcript
● Creating and collecting documents - agendas, minutes for making training and test sets
 Deliverables
● Initial release if the training data month 6, a final release at the end of second year
● Three different test sets months 10, 20, 30
● The corpus of the minutes - training data for the summarization
WP2 ASR
Robustness of acoustic modeling
Semi-supervised language adaptation
Lifelong learning during deployment
Deliverables missing

WP3 SLT
Transcript normalization
Developing methods to increase the robustness of MT systems towards noisy input texts
End-to-end speech text translation
Deliverables
● Three prototypes - alignment of prototypes are required
● Reports in the middle and at the end of the project
 Suggestion to include some languages for business reasons
● A question to [ORGANIZATION6] about languages in their interest - [OTHER5], [OTHER1], [OTHER8] would also be good
● Actually is also listed [OTHER2] and [OTHER6]

WP4 Multilingual MT
 The baseline model - [ORGANIZATION13], [ORGANIZATION12], [ORGANIZATION5] - It runs during the first half on first year
● Two purposes: delivery of the MT to [ORGANIZATION11] into the integration and for the research afterward
● Suggestion to go some of the languages only for the multilingual systems
 Document-level translation - Runs throughout three years
● For speech and also for the test
Multi-target MT - in the first year
● For the conference in the middle of the second year - translation from 6 to 43 languages
 Multi-source - second year
● Training on more sources of language to gain in translation quality
 Flexible multilingual MT
● Capable of translating from one-more languages into one-more languages at the same time
Deliverables missing - probably yearly reports and one deliverable on the baseline MT models

The gaps in introductory sections
● Partner description - everybody has to mention two people

Objectives, the relation to the work program, the early parts of the concept
● Everyone should read it and comment it

Methodology polishment required - two partners for each part
● Remote conferencing - reviewed by [ORGANIZATION12]
● The state of ASR missing - to write by [ORGANIZATION12] and [ORGANIZATION5] to review
● MT incomplete - [ORGANIZATION13] to fill and [ORGANIZATION5] will review it
● SLT - hopefully written by [ORGANIZATION5], reviewed by [ORGANIZATION13]
● The summarization is also probably finished - [ORGANIZATION12] to review it
● Minuting tools - reviewed by [ORGANIZATION6]
● Handling people - should be reviewed by everyone

The concept seems rather weak - [ORGANIZATION6] to provide further dissemination

Ambition missing - will be written by [ORGANIZATION13]
Expected impacts - Everyone to review it, every suggestion is welcome

Impact maximization - [ORGANIZATION6] to derive specific tasks for dissemination work-package
● Managing social media, local press releases, [ORGANIZATION7] - description and planned activities

WP5 Minuting
Discussion about the task “The live minute platform.”
● Collaboration between [ORGANIZATION13] and [ORGANIZATION6] is necessary
● According to [ORGANIZATION6], it is not doable with the scope of this project - only in case, it would be found some co-editing solution, especially for the actual project.
●  The first year - only research focused on online solutions - in case of failure end here for a while
● The second year - a possibility of implementing the interface
● Deliverables - two research reports to first year (initial, final) and demonstrator

WP6 The integration of the system 
The integration with the unified platform - [ORGANIZATION6] to describe the task
The integration of the minuting: [ORGANIZATION6], [ORGANIZATION13], [ORGANIZATION11] - clarification of the role of [ORGANIZATION11] - transcript generation
Task 6.3 will be replaced by task 5.5

WP7 Dissemination
 Lead by [ORGANIZATION6] - to populate tasks and to specify activities 
 Workshop on NLP technology at the [ORGANIZATION3] Congress
● To promote and disseminate technologies and collect user feedback
● [ORGANIZATION13] also plans to contribute to the organization of the workshop and feedback collection
 Deliverables - A short report about the workshop

Every task should be put into some specific time

[ORGANIZATION13] or [ORGANIZATION6] have to create task related to the website

[LOCATION4] should focus only on the platform task, [PERSON11] and [PERSON21] mainly to dissemination task
