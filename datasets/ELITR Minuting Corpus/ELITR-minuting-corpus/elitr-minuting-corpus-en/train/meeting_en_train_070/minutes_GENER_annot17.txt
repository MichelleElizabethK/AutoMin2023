[PROJECT1] Internal
Date: 24. 08. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON11], [PERSON9], [PERSON2], [PERSON3], ??
Purpose of meeting: discussing project updates, initiating new colleagues into the project, discussing constraint decoding in relation to the task and in general. 

- Introducing the new colleague.
-- He will be working on [PROJECT4] since he has experience with [PROJECT2] models etc. 
- Discussing progress from last week.
-- Some systems started to be trained, monolingual data is being downloaded to get the back translations.
- But mainly, awaiting [ORGANIZATION1]'s answer, unsure about their status and progress.
-- The last discussion with them happened on 19 August.
- Current priority: collection of data, so that it can be processed. 
- Discussion of possible plan B, if [ORGANIZATION1] is too late with starting their part. 
-- Using annotators will not be possible.
--- Annotators already worked on this project, there are not enough annotators and some of them know Czech, so it is problematic.
--- Moreover, the interesting statistics from this data have already been published (or will be published) in a separate paper.
-- Colleagues from another university make use of the Mechanical Turk platform to hire remote workers to perform the annotations.
- Delay in the project is probable, but it is not the biggest problem.
-- Initially, all the data was meant to be collected by the end of August. 
- What needs to be done to finish this long-lasting project.
-- The priority is getting [ORGANIZATION1] to do their part, still waiting for them.

- Discussing details about the task. 
-- Clarifying many doubts and incorrect conceptions about the task. 
-- Discussing positive and negative constraints. 
-- Discussing adopting positive constraints.
--- Even if the user doesn't fully understand the target language, he still understands some words, such as named entities. 
-- Discussing adopting paraphrasing. 
--- The user will be offered different paraphrases in the source language to help.
-- Discussing the source complexity task, which is already finished.
-- The user was provided with highlighted words that are prone to erroneous translation.
-- For this task, estimation system was used.
--- This system was implemented by researchers from [ORGANIZATION8]. 
-- Discussing negative constraints. 
--- Discussing an approach that uses the Levenshtein transformer and applies only positive constraints.
--- The participants generally agreed that negative constraining is not necessary in this task.
-- Clarifying that three components need to be tested in this experiment.
--- Back translation; paraphrasing through pivot languages and quality estimation. 
---- Through preliminary results we know that users are most confident with the back translation.
---- Users are not very confident with quality estimation and word highlighting. 
---- Paraphrasing proved to be sometimes helpful, but sometimes not.  

- Discussing constraint decoding, clarifying its definition, the need for its implementation. 
-- Discussing various papers related to constraint decoding (Matt Post, Hu et al.).
-- Some implementations of negative constraints into [PROJECT4] have already been done by [ORGANIZATION1] researchers.
--- [ORGANIZATION1] researchers have no further plans to continue with these implementations, but can definitely help if needed, especially with implementing positive constraints. 
-- The focus of the approach to implementation needs to be clarified.
-- Possibly look at weaknesses from the various papers and try to improve these weaknesses. 
-- Discussing constraints outside of the task itself, thinking more generally about it. 
--- Demystifying: The constraints are being applied to the target language. 
-- Other possible approach towards analyzing constraints.
--- How much can we actually constrain a system to still produce reasonable translations.
---- Nobody has looked into it yet, but the experiment would need to be properly designed.  
-- Auto regressive and non autoregressive decoders. 
-- Discussing the Zotero shared library.
--- It will be used for papers related to this topic of constraining. 
-- Discussing noisy constraints, they are to be discussed in more detail in a later meeting. 

- The ideas from this meeting and the follow-up meetings will be recorded in a document which was created previously and which contains explanations of the task.
