d) Section 4.10 – Task Description and Justification
•	[ORGANIZATION1] shared task will form part of the [PROJECT1] special session as the general session doesn't allow for floating one's own tasks and challenges.
•	Justification on viability and special session participation is required.
•	[ORGANIZATION1] shard task focuses on the very particular and niche area.
•	Creation of automatic minutes and summarisations of project meetings has proven an extremely challenging task.
•	Currently no-one is able to perform this task in an appropriate way, therefore the shared task is run as a brainstorming session, to open the discussion and lower down the entry barrier as the automatic meeting summarisation has not been yet explored in this manner.
•	Current level of technical possibilities limits the full exploration and applicability of the task but it is believed that the task is plausible with further development in neural science.
•	Long research papers are not yet available in the academic and scientific community.
•	Task cannot be run in the normal session due to non-existent comparable results.
•	[ORGANIZATION1] shared task offers three tasks to v opportunities to tackle the challenge from different angles.
e) Biographical information for each of the Team/Shared task participants.

Administrative matters:
•	The participation of the Project Manager on the call was not possible due to his extremely busy schedule, however will be required in the next meeting.
•	Technical issues occurred during the call.
