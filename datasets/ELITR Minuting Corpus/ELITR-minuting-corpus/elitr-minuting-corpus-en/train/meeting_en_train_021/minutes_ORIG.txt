Meeting 10. 8. 2020:
Attendance: [PERSON8], [PERSON10], [PERSON9], [PERSON7], [PERSON1]

- [PROJECT6] (progress)
-- weak teacher training - finished
-- student distillation - problems with reproducing (too much degradation in BLEU)
- stay with [PROJECT4] due to time constraints
- if we have to stay with [PROJECT4], let's actually use 3 systems for Czech, giving us two interesting comparisons:
- [PROJECT4] good (slow), [PROJECT2] student good (fast), [PROJECT4] bad (slow)
- The comparisons are [PROJECT4] good vs. bad and Good slow vs. Good fast (i.e. [PROJECT4] vs. [PROJECT2] good models)
- [PROJECT8](progress)
-- experiments still running
-- currently, single source MT seems to be better than [PROJECT8]
-- manual evaluation might be needed
-- evaluate systems trained on varying size of data
- can we use [PROJECT8] in the low-resource setting?
