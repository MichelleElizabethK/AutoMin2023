Annotation process:
1st Automatic ASR.
2nd Correction of the automatic ASR – creation of manual transcript.
3rd Creation of reference summary using the transcript (created by annotators).
4th Alignment of summary with transcript (not yet functional). 
Table tooltips:
[PROJECT1] minuting table:
- “MAN” = manually corrected transcript.
- Colon “Twice transcript”/”Twice minutes” – “0” = done once, “1” = done twice.
Qualitative analysis document:
- “ORIG” = original minute by meeting organizer or secretary.
- “GENER” = additionally created minutes by annotators.
Qualitative analysis document:
- Represents which tasks are already done.
- Also represents what is needed to be done by participants.
Gold standard:
- [PERSON2] is working on evaluation system that could help to solve the gold standard problem.
Ethical problems with shared data
- Data has to be anonymized (names won't be stated).
- Only release transcript, reference summary and evaluation scores.
- Create a paper/electronic/PDF document where all parties will give a consent for sharing the data till November ([PERSON6] will create, [PERSON7] will double-check).
- When sending the consent document send also a snipper that will showcase how the data is anonymized.
Next steps:
- When the alignment tool is ready, annotators will be given 2 tasks. Instead of just the alignment they will also have to estimate the quality of the summary. For that some questions have to be framed up.
- [PERSON5] will take care of those questions.
- Set up the meeting with [PERSON1] and discuss this new approach.
