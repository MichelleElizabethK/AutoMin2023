(PERSON6) Eh eh give me a moment, please let me do some. 
(PERSON3) Yes, meanwhile I am also start checking our services if they are all online, so please tell me when we are going to start the tests because also [PERSON5] asked me to record the ah let's see the recap demo video for tomorrow. <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Aha okay.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON6) Uh. 
I think even my video is not required so I shall turn it off.
Is that okay?
(PERSON3) Yes sure.

<another_language/>
<another_language/>
(PERSON6) Hello, hello, hello.

(PERSON3) Okay just a second.
(PERSON6) Okay.
<unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
(PERSON3) Okay, do you hear me slightly better now?
(PERSON6) I think there is something wrong because there are too many plugins in my laptop, and I do not for which is input-

(PERSON6) Okay, okay, okay, no problem.
Uh I am audible, loud and clear, right?
(PERSON3) Sorry?
(PERSON6) I am audible, loud and clear, right?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay.
Okay, so how how do we start?
Uh, I think when it will be my voice going to <unintelligible/> platform, so okay, just to start to start everything.
(PERSON3) Okay, for me it's fine, but actually I think that we have to wait for eh the [ORGANIZATION11] guys and the [ORGANIZATION8] guys before starting.
Because [PERSON4] on the general em general channel on em <unintelligible/> says he's not able to see any ehm worker.
But actually on <unintelligible/> web, both the original one and the second one I see workers, so maybe there is some problem on site.
I don't know.
Maybe we need to restart of all the systems.
(PERSON6) Okay okay I think we can till we can do some fixings okay?
(PERSON3) Okay.
() Are you busy with something or?
(PERSON6) No, I am just setting.
() Yeah, so but but eh so uh when you are done just tell me.
(PERSON6) Yes yes sure sure sure sure .
()  I'm, may I just remove some, there are like <unintelligible/> these  files.
(PERSON6) Yes, exactly, I will move this one. 
Ok Ok. 
There are actually eh two teams, [ORGANIZATION2] and [ORGANIZATION8].
They are not here so we are waiting for them right now. 
So as soon as they came, come, we will start.
<another_language/>
(PERSON6) So.
The the this trip for <unintelligible/> .
I can't see her.
So, this should work <unintelligible/>.
Maybe.
(PERSON3) Oh, hello [PERSON2]. 
(PERSON1) Hi.
(PERSON3) Eh, [PERSON6], sorry.
Ehm, are you going to stream also slides for the test demo?
Ok, maybe he's away. <laugh/>
S H-Halo, so, yea- yeah, I'm here, sorry, sorry for that
Halo, morning [PERSON2].
(PERSON3) No problem.
[PERSON6], are you also going to stream slides for tomorrow tests?
(PERSON6) Eh, I am not responsible for slides.
 I am I'm really sorry for that, but I think [PERSON7], [PERSON5], they will be the ones who will be responsible.
(PERSON3) Yes, ehm, ok.
Eh, since I have to record-
Oh my gosh, I have internet connection problems so please, really, I'm really sorry, but I think that at some point <laugh/> my connection will fall dramatically. 
Eh, but, em, I think that probably in order to record a a back up a video, we need also the inslide streaming. 
You know, to fill the presentation platform, eh, video box. 
What do you think?
(PERSON6) Uhuh, yeah, I completely agree with you.
So what you say shall we take any random slides, and-
(PERSON3) Yes,<laugh/>, yes, I- even, even, actually it is not required to be, eh, slide. 
It might also be the, em, [PROJECT1] website <laugh/>, but are you, em, able to start the, em, the streaming or do you need eh support?
(PERSON6) I think, eh, I am not sure, this is the first time, so I think I need to click on these files.
Eh, I can write, eh, uh, let me just check it. 
Ok, yeah, I think this is the one. 
So, ok, and I need to download some a little presentation.
(PERSON3) Ok, ok.
Ehm, meanwhile, [PERSON2], sorry, [PERSON4] was saying that he is not able to reach, eh, workers, to this morning.
May I ask you to check if everything is working smoothly? 
Actually, I see all the workers up and running in the main web administration page but I also know that it's not 100% reliable.
(PERSON1) Ehm, yes, data is right, though, you, actually <unintelligible/>, different media was used in a-
(PERSON3) Yes, I know, there are two different mediators right now, but workers are connected to both of them or not?
(PERSON1) Uhm, I am checking right now.
(PERSON3) Thank you so much.
(PERSON1) Uhm, I check the other one, to figure out how-
(PERSON6) So I think this is the call-
I guess it should work but please correct me if I am wrong.
(PERSON3) Ok. 
Actually if you are streaming and preparing uh local URL-
URL probably you will be the only one seeing the the also this live streaming which is is fine it's not a problem but in this case-
Oh, nice.
(PERSON6) So o you can see some pdf file I think I downloaded. 
(PERSON3) Eh, yes I see it.
 The [ORGANIZATION9], the [ORGANIZATION9] web application.
(PERSON6) Aha, aha yeah yeah yeah.
(PERSON1) Wait.
So, explain to me again are we using [ORGANIZATION11] tomorrow?
(PERSON6) Yeah, I think so.
Yeah we are using [ORGANIZATION11]  but they are not here or online I think.
(PERSON1) But we all, online presentation platform-
(PERSON6) Uh, one, let me let me verify it, ehm.
I think uh we, we do not have [ORGANIZATION11] today.
Uh it is just [ORGANIZATION4] because uh I am going to the email right now by [PERSON5] and it does not mention anywhere [ORGANIZATION11].
(PERSON3) Well, eh, [PERSON4] wrote on the general channel this morning eh saying actually at 11 o'clock he were checking, he was checking the worker's connections so I think that probably he's online actually.
(PERSON1) So I just checked into the, <unintelligible/> and we can not maintain full suite of workers, it would be nice if we narrow it down to one.
(PERSON3) Ok.
(PERSON1) Or be the one that <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Ok, ehm.
If I, sorry, the, my internet connection is really bad today.
So if I correctly understood you said, eh, you are able to provide workers, just for one of the two mediators. 
Is it correct?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Oh gosh.
(PERSON6) I think even I am not able to hear [PERSON2].
Maybe there is some short of internet connection.
(PERSON1) But I can hear you.
Hm.
<unintelligible/>
Boy, it's actually, I will have to go quickly and to verify how long within the server <unintelligible/> one of our server, so- 
(PERSON3) <another_language/>
Ok, sorry guys. 
Since I hear you really, really bad, especially [PERSON2], I don't know why <laugh/> because I I hear [PERSON6] pretty well.
I, I wrote something.
(PERSON6)  Yeah even me. 
I hear [PERSON2] pretty broken voice.
(PERSON3) Ok, I wrote something on the select channel so we, we can also use it for communication, ehm. 
Sorry [PERSON2], if I ask you to repeat again, <laugh/>, everything. 
I'm so sorry, but I really didn't heard anything. 
May I ask you to reply in this live channel?
<another_language/>
(PERSON6) S- sorry are you talking to me or for [PERSON2]?
(PERSON3) To [PERSON2].
(PERSON6) Ok, ok, ok. 
Becau- uh, also I was, like, checking the MTs, like, and the MTs, MT workers are not running. 
I, I think they just seem to be stuck.
(PERSON3) Ok, meanwhile, eh, [PERSON6], sorry, may I ask you to try to connect to, ehm, the ehm, try to stream subtitles to the presentation platform so we can start at least testing.
(PERSON6) Eh, hello, I think I lost you.
(PERSON3)  <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) I lost your voice for a moment.
(PERSON3) May-
May I ask you to try to stream some subtitle to the presentation platform?
(PERSON6) Ok, sure, sure, sure, but, as I can see here, only the-
Eh, uh, one moment, ok, ok, yeah and ok.
(PERSON3) Ok, ok, [PERSON2] says that there are only ASR workers.
The the workers, the ASR workers are connected only to [ORGANIZATION11] one-
(PERSON6) Ok, aha, ok.
(PERSON3) Ok.
(PERSON6) So I I I started, I started the ASR worker and I can see the text, but let me check [ORGANIZATION4] platform.
No, I have not seen the text in here.
(PERSON3) Ok ehm let's wait for [PERSON2], just a second.
(PERSON6) Ok.
(PERSON3) <laugh/> OK. Ehm eh, [PERSON6], do you read the [PERSON2] on this live channel? 
(PERSON6) Oh, OK so yeah, there are only, yeah exactly even I am also facing the re- <unintelligible/>
Because I, uh one thing, i am facing and-
Sure here is that-
Ok I ok I think that I too start running right now, but- 
Why don't I see the subtitle subtitles here.
(PERSON3) Ok.
I saw them. 
Ehm, I saw the English and the German stream, ok nice, uhm.
(PERSON6) Ok.
Ok, yeah, even I can see, so-
(PERSON3) Ok, the czech one, ok nice, ok.
(PERSON6) And ok, I think and the <unintelligible/> is speaking, so that and and list to skip some running and not just ad hoc.
Appears ok, I, not, there's no polish <unintelligible/> czech, this german-
(PERSON3) Ok, we have czech, german, and the uhm english.
(PERSON6) Aha, yeah.
(PERSON3) Which is pretty fine for recording a video.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, but I not see anything in the presentation, so how? 
How?
(PERSON3) The, the video streaming.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Me too, actually, and this is, I don't know how you set up the the streaming.
(PERSON6) I have no idea.
(PERSON3) Ok, you are streaming some work and somewhere should be an HS URL, the one speak the M3,  eh, you wait.
So remember, ehm, but we need to configure the DUL presentation.
(PERSON6) Aha, ok, I think I get it.
I think I need to paste the link for the p, p, eh, pc, eh. 
I don't know if this is going to work or not, but let's try so I can see the isn't setting to edit the link for the default, the video save, um, back to home, no www, there's nothing, so I pasted the link to the packet
(PERSON3) Just let me check, eh eh, may I ask you to copy and paste me, also the link in this live channel, so that I can check it if it is fine or if we need something different or whatever.
(PERSON6) So, I just pasted the web link, that's all.
(PERSON3) Eh, the presentation platform requires the, ehm e-, czech
(PERSON6) I, I, I, I am losing you.
I am losing you.
(PERSON3) Ah, ok, no, I saw your link, so ehm, me-
(PERSON6) Ok, so you-
(PERSON3) M3, U8 URL, like, let me check stream.
Ok, I am searching for an example, just give me one second.
(PERSON6) Ah, ok, ok, ok, if you have any arbitrary link that we can use as the-
(PERSON3) Yes, but, <laugh/>, yes, but usually, ehm, ehm, commercials, video, or,<laugh/>, 
or it's probably something, 
it's really probably better if its something really related to,<laugh/>
(PERSON6) We can use anything, it is short one, that it is our aim-
(PERSON3) I can also explain you, how to set up a stream, also in decrease control <unintelligible/>,
there should be, um, streaming, em, script, but you need to set up, uhm-
Ok, we can also maybe I, ok, and-
Ok, in this live channel, I will see an example of M of <unintelligible/> URL but there could also be the case that I stream something and I record the video so that I can stream. 
For example, the [PROJECT1] website. 
Let's see, record the video with at least something meaningful in the video box, he let's check this possibility. 
Just give me one second to set up the streaming.
(PERSON6) Ok ok, so how do I get this. 
Ok, I can see there are two sound streaming with FFPT. 
(PERSON3) <laugh/> The first example I found in the-
(PERSON6) Cruise control there.
So, once we test this [ORGANIZATION4] platform, we are going to test an alternate web line. 
So, ehm, because we have issues with the dialog box, the site of the dialog box and the sentence, because it is just two lines and sometimes the subtitles as like more than two lines. 
So we have a web client ready, and we will be testing that too, as of today.
(PERSON3) Eh, ok, you are allowed to test what you prefer, but I stress the fact that we need at least a video of the presentation platform, of course.
(PERSON6) Exactly, so once this is done and we are sure that this is ok and up to our expectations, we will move further
(PERSON3) Yeah, just give me one second, that we are setting the streaming. 
Actually we will be probably the only one seeing the video streaming, but we will be allowed to record by ourself the video and then share it with you.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, ok ok ok.
I think there should have been a readme file for this streaming, so that I could have ran it <unintelligible/>
Ok, I think I have some camera here, which, which I can run.
Ok, I get it.
(PERSON3) Sorry, [PERSON6], I need to go upstairs one second, sorry.
(PERSON6) Ok, sure, sure, sure.
Please take your time, yeah?
<another_language/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Hi guys, sorry, I am back.
(PERSON6) There was actually some noise here, so I'll just pause for a few minutes.
(PERSON3) Hi guys, do you hear me?
(PERSON6) Yes, I can hear you.
So, do you hear me?
(PERSON3) Yes.
We actually sees, due to our network problem.
(PERSON6) OK, cool.
(PERSON3) Two hour network problem.
We are not video streaming right now, so we put a static <unintelligible/>.
Sorry. <laugh/>
But it will work.
(PERSON6) OK, OK.
(PERSON3) So, actually we are ready to record the de- the demo video. 
So [PERSON6], I- I  know that I needs a lot of time. 
Are you able and allowed to start, eh, the subtitles streaming of presentation platform, or we missed something important?
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, I can start now.
(PERSON3) OK. 
My colleague is recording the video of the webpage, ehm.
I can suggest-
(PERSON6) OK, I also just start my screen recording.
(PERSON3) OK. This is nice, ehm.
I suggested to read something related to [PROJECT1] project or news or something like this general topic, but [PROJECT1] project would be very nice.
(PERSON6) Uh, I didn't understand you. 
You mean to say my speech should evolve around [PROJECT1], everything around [PROJECT1], alright? 
Is that would you mean to say?
(PERSON3) Well, it‘s just a suggestion if you have some interesting topic to explain us, we can listen you, really interest <laugh/>.
(PERSON6) I, I <laugh/> I would rather go with, eh, <laugh/> [PROJECT1] <unintelligible/>. So- 
(PERSON3) Yes. <laugh/>
(PERSON6) My phone, so that I don't have to switch windows. 
Alright.
OK, I have some document printed to-
Yeah I- 
Sure, sure, sure.
<another_language/>
(PERSON6) My screen recording seems to work. 
Or I think you also doing the screen recording, right?
(PERSON3) Yes, but a back up is always appreciated. <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Yes, because of my screen recording just seems to appear black and just audio. 
So little on when this demo is over.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON6)  I would really appreciate if you could share me the recording.
(PERSON3) Yes, of course, but since we get one safe, <laugh/> it‘s better if we both record something and we will see.
(PERSON6) OK, so the restart.
(PERSON6) The MT‘s from [ORGANIZATION6] <unintelligible/>, I told him. 
I really appreciate if this stay the safety purpose. <laugh/>
(PERSON3) I see the English subtitles, but not the translations.
(PERSON6) Yeah, because the MTs from [ORGANIZATION6] are not running, let me try-
(PERSON3) But the, eeeh, the [ORGANIZATION13] one? 
The [ORGANIZATION13] workers, you also provide the machine translation, if I call you to remember. 
Is it correct?
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) OK, OK,  no, no, don‘t worry, don‘t worry.
(PERSON6) Do we also have the MT workers here?
We have but, ehm, is, it's like not running now <unintelligible/>
OK, so <unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
(PERSON6) I <unintelligible/> my input volume, so that there are noises here.
So you don't hear-
(PERSON3) OK, do you set we will be able to some better, uh, <unintelligible/> the interest party and ask them to-
OK, so is in this connect, let me check.
(PERSON6) OK, so he is using-
OK, so [PERSON2] says that they are running on 60021.
OK I think I'm too-
(PERSON3) So, OK.
Connection problems and I, everything, what? 
Maybe it's better in the afternoon? 
(PERSON6) I am losing you <unintelligible/> broken voice.
(PERSON3) Ehm.
(PERSON6) I think that- 
I think if you have Windows in your computer, you have a LAN connection. 
Is that right?
Wire connection in your computer.
(PERSON3) I see the English subtitles.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I, I, I am going to fix it now.
(PERSON3) OK, I am also writing on the [ORGANIZATION5] channel.
(PERSON6) OK, alright.
<another_language/>
(PERSON3) OK, [PERSON6], are, are you fine with what I wrote on the [ORGANIZATION5] channel?
(PERSON6) Oh, I am going through it, eh, please one moment.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON6) Yes, I agreed you, and I agree with you, that English ASR is working but the MTs are not.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON6) But I, I, I have stopped the ASR for, for, for, for now, uhm.
(PERSON6) Shall I run the ASR again, or do I, like, wait for the MT?
(PERSON3) Sorry?
(PERSON6) Eh, do I run the ASR again, or, like, do I wait for MT?
(PERSON3) Uh, just we have to wait, that the machine translation services are available, so that we can record a 3 minutes video. <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Ok, ok, because I see the MTs from [ORGANIZATION6] they, they, are not dist- 
They are not - 
(PERSON3) Yes, [PERSON7] is providing coordination on this [ORGANIZATION5] channel, just wait a second, have faith, <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, very nice, yeah. 
<unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Ok, I, uh, <unintelligible/>, thank you.
(PERSON6) Ok, uh, so [PERSON3], right now the MTs are running from [ORGANIZATION6].
(PERSON3) Oh, nice.
(PERSON6) And I can run the ASR czech and, czech and german, cool, cool, cool, so here.
(PERSON3) Ok, I see the english subtitles.
(PERSON6) Uh, no, they are not running. 
I mean they are running, but someone else is using all.
(PERSON3) Oh my gosh.
(PERSON6) There something wrong.
Aha, ok, sorry, sorry.
Ok, I, I there, no.
(PERSON3) Oh.
(PERSON6) [PERSON3], do you, do you write me? 
(PERSON3) Yes, and, and I see the subtitles. It-
(PERSON6) Ok, I so-
(PERSON3) Ok, you are allowed to start using the-
(PERSON6) Ok, so you can, I can start recording.
(PERSON3) Yes, we are, we were already recording. <laugh/>
We record the whole session.
(PERSON6) Ok, so, ok, ok, so what do we do next?
(PERSON3) Well, you can start reading something relating to the [PROJECT1] project or some topic.
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, so I will start.
Ok, so I will read the relation to the work program, so.
Running the public administration of business in a multilingual environment that requires frequent and, and, undelayed communication across languages. 
Our two partners, [ORGANIZATION12] and [ORGANIZATION3], are typical representatives of two major types of industrial users. 
[ORGANIZATION12], the [ORGANIZATION12] of the Czech Republic and an active member in the [ORGANIZATION7] [ORGANIZATION1], contacted [ORGANIZATION13], in late 2016, seeking for technological guidance and support in [ORGANIZATION12]'s contribution to the [ORGANIZATION1] mission.
Improving cooperation and innovation among the 50 congress, among the 50 [ORGANIZATION1] members. 
[ORGANIZATION12] as part of its upcoming presidency, presidency of [ORGANIZATION1], will be joining the [ORGANIZATION1] congress in May 2020 in [LOCATION1], and the aim is to provide automatic interpreting into the languages of all audit reports and other documents by [ORGANIZATION1] members into all [ORGANIZATION1] languages. 
Even this particular domain of public administration language barriers cause a considerable hindrance for both written and spoken form of communication. 
Audit documents are created in national languages and translated only into English, if at all. 
To keep translation costs manageable, at the same regular employs, holidays of [ORGANIZATION10]s are not expected to speak foreign languages at live meetings. 
<unintelligible/> representatives often lack sufficient language proficiency to actively participate in the discussions, anyway, in English. 
The communication can be difficult, with strong accents of international participants. 
Interpreting is not always available, not to mention its cost. 
[ORGANIZATION3] offers the [ORGANIZATION11] video conferencing platform to many companies and institutes, to facilitate meetings regardless of their location. 
This project should lead to new opportunities for connecting people, not just location, independent but also regardless of which language they speak. 
Professional interpreters represent a high cost factor, which is difficult to justify for small meetings or training courses. 
A video conference- conferencing system, with integrated translation and automated minuting, brings a new level of efficiency within a corporate context. 
That new development will facilitate and improve exchange for companies with their offices, subsidiaries, or partners across country borders.
So I think is this ok, or do I need to read more?
(PERSON3) Eh, may I ask you, uh, uh, just for test, eh? 
I hear you reading really really fast. 
Are you experienced in ASR technology, do you know how the consolidation of hypotheses works? [PERSON6] do you hear me?
(PERSON6) No, I think maybe.
(PERSON3) Ok, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.
Ok, so I think maybe [PERSON7] would be the right person to answer this.
(PERSON3) No, no, no, stay, stay, please, please stay, I am just giving you the suggestion. 
(PERSON6) I am staying.
I'm here, I'm here.
(PERSON3) Try-
Ok, ok.
Try to read, to slightly, slowly, especially think of pauses on full stops because pauses are interpret as, ok, one sentence is finished, and can go the next evaluation. 
May I ask you to read, ehm, just one paragraph.
(PERSON6) Ok.
Sure, sure, sure, so I rather-
(PERSON3) Nice, just one paragraph. 
We do not need to repeat everything, ok? 
Thank you.
(PERSON6) Ok,ok, sure, let me find, fine and easy.
Yeah, so.
Our main technical innovations will be geared towards unified natural language processing platform, in comprising robust adaptable speech recognition, enter into spoken language translation, machine translation capable of handling hundreds of language pairs, and considering the entire context of the document, and automatic summarization of discussions into meeting minutes. 
The-
(PERSON3) I don't know what happened. <laugh/>
I see no subtitles at all right now.
[PERSON6] do you hear me? 
Some internet connection problem maybe. 
[PERSON6] do you hear me?
