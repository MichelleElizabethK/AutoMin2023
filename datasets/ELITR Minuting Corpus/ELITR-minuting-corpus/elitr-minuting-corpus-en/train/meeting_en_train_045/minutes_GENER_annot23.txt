Meeting [PROJECT1]
Date: 18. 08. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON8], [PERSON7], [PERSON1], [PERSON5], [PERSON4]
Purpose of meeting: Discussion of their book, talking about reviewers and their understanding of the book's topic


-Discussing reviews
-- They wanted to contact the reviewers but weren't sure whether the text was suitable for linguists, since they wouldn't understand it.
-- They will get reviews from different kinds of people, with or without the knowledge of neural networks.
-- That way, they will get different points of view.
-- Only a one-page review is needed.

-Details about potential reviewers
-- They will ask an assistant professor from [LOCATION2] for a review.
-- They could ask somebody from [LOCATION1].

-Problems with past reviews
-- Sometimes the reviewers wrote a positive review but then unofficially told them what to do differently (without writing it in the review).
-- Some reviewed a wrong version of the paper.

-Added information
-- Adding [PERSON4] as a co-author of the book.
-- [PERSON4]'s paper was accepted to [PROJECT4].
-- One paper was submitted and accepted by [PROJECT2].
-- There are now two articles in journals about this project.

-Conclusion and future plans
-- The book doesn't need to be submitted for printing this year.
-- The reviewers must receive it in October, but it would be better to have it done earlier.
-- Thus the book should be done in the middle of 2021.
-- Finishing their chapters.
-- One of the chapters has some issues with terminology.
-- They could have another meeting this afternoon if needed.
