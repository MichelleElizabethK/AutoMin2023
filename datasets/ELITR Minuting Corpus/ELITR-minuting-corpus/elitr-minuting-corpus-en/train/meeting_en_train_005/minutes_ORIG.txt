•	[URL1]
•	[PERSON7] asks or many and nasty tests: tearing off the ethernet cable etc.
o	...so that we know how the system behaves and how to fix it as quickly as possible
•	[PERSON4] to share all test session slots with [PERSON3], so that [PERSON3] can be available (but [PERSON3] should be needed only in emergence)
- 	Start testing on the [PROJECT1] test-sets

- 	Using MT wrappers for SLT demo
- 	
			
•	[PERSON6]
o	Scripts were written to run SLTev and ASRev over submissions. 
o	I put results in [PATH]  and, I put problems in the google docs and, I made a TSV file for them.
o	[PERSON7] has received a remark from a team who failed to participate in time, [PERSON7] asked them if they could participate late, so possibly there could be one more (late) submission coming.
o	TODO:
- 	Make a jupyter program for analyzing the TSV file	
•	[PERSON3]
o	Yesterday: a list of submissions
o	Review of [URL] -- [ORGANIZATION2] janus-asr startup script
o	Small review of this: [URL] ([PERSON10]'s workers)
o	Today: backendASR -- connection of (Kaldi) ASR and mediator
o	TODO:
- 	Consider taking part in the KUDO-based mock conference next week.
- Check the KUDO files from the previous one.
•	[PATH]
•	-> make sense out of it
•	before Monday 11th
- 	These results by [PERSON3] (the negative ones) should go into [URL]
•	[PERSON1]
o	TODO: get in touch with [PERSON3] about window-based translation
