(PERSON7) Hi, hello.
Can you hear me, does it work?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
() Hi.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
Yeah, great.
So thanks for yo-
Thanks to all who are here.
[PERSON8] and [PERSON14] said they couldn't make it today.
So they'll add their bits to the documencht soon.
And what is most urgent and I'll I'll like to start with so that I don't 
forget.
Is the demo for the project officer.
And [PERSON4] is the main person looking after this from our side.
Our integrator [ORGANIZATION3] are not exactly, well, successful in in the set-ups so 
to say.
So I would like to ask we we had  shsh I sa-
Yeah, so we we still don't have [PERSON10] I was kinda hoping that [PERSON10] would 
would also join.
So anybody who has some experience with YouTube streaming and YouTube re-
streaming I mean stream, live streaming of some video which was already 
available on YouTube beforehand.
These skills would be would be useful.
Yeah.
Ok.
So I <laugh/> it's probably none none of none of you here.
Ehm what else [PERSON4] could we ask help for?
(PERSON4) Honestly I have very little knowledge about these things.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so.
Yeah, so if some other people join then will will possibly ask f for for that 
help again.
Ok, so for I see that you're filling things.
I would like to thank as well to [PERSON4] and also to to [PERSON10] who is not 
here and also [PERSON3] who has reviewed that for and obviously to [PERSON9].
The Unihack subtitling.
[PERSON4] did you also have a chance to follow that, to see what it is 
actually doing?
(PERSON4) The Unihack subtitling?
(PERSON7) Yeah.
Yeah.
(PERSON4) Yeah, actually no, I didn't get the question so what do I-?
(PERSON7) Sorry.
I was asking if you actually tried to play the role of foreign speaking 
participant.
If you checked the content.
What it is actually doing.
(PERSON4) You mean like speaker indetification?
(PERSON7) No, just Unihack.
The the the subtitling.
How did it go?
(PERSON4) Yeah, ok, yeah.
That it it it went nice, it it was great.
And I have recorded audio and the directories have been updated with the logs and automatic transripts.
Recordings, yeah, so.
I I think, but I I don't think if anyone even care to look at those subtitles.
Yeah, so I'm in need, we needed, we, we, we, should have like done some kind of adve ad advertisement. Probably.
(PERSON7) I heard from the organisers that there was a person at least 1 person 
who has like joined that thanks to the subtitling.
(PERSON4) Yeah, exactly.
So there there there were like only those-
I think there was the first meeting which was the Czech and a foreign person 
join and he was like English speaking and he he was the one to view.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
(PERSON4) And that I think he he uploaded the subtitles and they were quite good.
03:44 And [PERSON10] even [PERSON9] even said that the Czech AR the Czech subtitles from the MT models 
which is the back translated Czech was better than real ASR Czech.
And that is a strange one.
(PERSON7) Ok.
<laugh/>
So which is-
<other_noise/> <unintelligible/> operation.
So we we need to ask [PERSON9] what is the like to to to summarize that.
(PERSON4) Yeah, exactly, yeah.
(PERSON7) Yeah, ok.
So, then, we still don't have.
We still don't have [PERSON10] here.
So maybe you or [PERSON3] will know about the English to 41 MT model testing.
So what is the what is the status there?
(PERSON4) Last time when I was testing ehm, [PERSON10] made many corrections that <unintelligible/> 
the delay issue.
But still it's there and it's not properly is not properly fixed but-
It has been like taking care of right now.
Make it to make it bit usable.
And I think.
So right now I want using [PERSON3]'s MT wrapper with with his with that MT 
models right now.
And I plan to do with in the next future sessions.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
So we need aside from this testing whether like it works in some way or 
whether the delay is acceptable.
We also need to really start the testing on the [PROJECT1] test set.
So we need numbers.
We need blascores, we need delays whatever, we need this regular loop of the 
the leather climbing.
So are you.
So I guess you should now now your priority really is the the demo.
<unintelligible/>
But this is this is the thing that you should focus on very soon aft- after 
that or like when when you're waiting for someone for the demo or.
Yeah, when your demo scripts are kind of Okay and you're waiting for the 
session to test them with other people, please start working on the 
evaluation of the translation models and also the ASR models.
So this this whole Unihack thing that can again be a test set.
A part of a test set, if we get it transcribed.
The, we can evaluate word error rate, yeah, and and all that.
So please start, yeah, yeah.
Better than Czech ASR.
How did it go.
Some kind of a report.
Yep.
So, here the lag was still there.
So the next step is that [PERSON10] should still look at it?
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah.
And [PERSON10] will be running some things with tests.
And <unintelligible/> for it.
(PERSON7) [PERSON4] will look at it and here [PERSON7] reminds of the need to start 
leather climbing with [PROJECT1] test set.
Yeah, yeah, Okay.
And then thanks for the punctuation retrain.
The stats look good.
I know this is only recall.
So that's what we are focusing on.
(PERSON4) Yeah. Yeah.
(PERSON7) And we see some improvement, the more sentences you have in the training 
data the higher the recall.
I hope that-
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>Yeah.
(PERSON7) Yeah, I hope the precision is not decreasing much.
(PERSON4) No. No. No.
(PERSON7) But, yeah.
But I would like-
So this is this looks promising.
Still give especially given the problems that we have with the segments are 
too short, too long, then I would prefer the recall to really get close to 
100.
Even at the cost of decreased precision.
So so really let's let's like overshoot recall.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON7) So that I think that would be usefull.
So I'll yep.
So [PERSON7] suggest to really try overshooting recall.
The point is that we can then hide the full stops to the user.
But we can use these segments to get the translations faster.
S- 
And like more responsive.
So the full stops could be then used only internally.
Not shown to the users.
But still they would greatly improve the responsiveness.
So to say.
Of MT.
So, yeah.
(PERSON4) Yep, yep.
(PERSON7) Yeah, Ok?
 So preparation for the meeting with demo, great.
Start testing on [PROJECT1] test leather climb, yeah yeah, ok, great.
Great, so we have [PERSON6].
[PERSON6] can you talk?
Just quick check of the connection.
Scripts were written, put results and put them make it to-
Yeah, yeah, ok.
So to summarise, [PERSON6] has processed the submissions to <unintelligible/> SLT.
I know, thanks for resending that e-mail that that I accidentally somehow 
deleted.
I got any hac I do have the the new copy.
But I I still have not had a time to to like look at those numbers.
And exactly, yes.
<unintelligible/> pre-start processing that the all the results now.
One more message is that [PERSON7] has recieved remark from a team who failed to 
participate in time.
[PERSON7] ask them again.
Asked them if they could participate late so possibly, but this is not sure.
There could be 1 more submission coming.
Late.
It will be mar-
If we if it arrives it will mark it as late.
Ok, yeah, great.
So that's progress from [PERSON6].
And [PERSON3].
Yes, please go ahead.
(PERSON3) Hello.
Can you hear me?
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON4) Yeah, we can hear you.
(PERSON3) So yesterday I did spreadsheet with a list of submissions that we have.
And I included the path and send it to [PERSON11] and [PERSON6] and.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON7) Yeah.
(PERSON3) And so on.
And I did a short review of this uni [PERSON13]'s ASR start up script.
And and of the [PERSON10]'s worker and I found that it's probably too slow.
But when [PERSON4] use it, it wasn't so slow, so I don't know how.
What's-
(PERSON4) So actually during the weekend while you're on holiday [PERSON10] made some 
corrections and he added a new file with less number of language.
And it has-
(PERSON3) But I reviewed this and it was slow at on my part.
In my test but not in your not in your real session.
(PERSON4) Really?
(PERSON3) Yes.
But I tested it with MT wrapper.
Did you use MT wrapper?
(PERSON4) No, I I'm not using MT wrapper so I don't know.
(PERSON3) Well, then then the delay is too long and you should start using it.
Because it's not realistic.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am still worried about the MT wrapper that it has like too many parameters which which 
are dependent on the type of type of worker from <unintelligible/> it's like a linear worker or <unintelligible/>.
Yeah.
(PERSON3) But there is one convenient function in the set up scripts that you 
should use.
(PERSON4) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
So I'll look at it.
(PERSON7) So maybe, yeah.
Sorry to interrupt.
Maybe this goes back to another long standing task for [PERSON4] to do.
And that's to to make the the running the set up folder like make it make it 
a stable thing kind of version so or like polish it.
That's it.
That's the that's the short request.
So that our set up is the best that we want to have.
And not always put together with duck tape.
Yeah, so [PERSON3] so-
Yep.
(PERSON3) And I'm continuing with with back end ASR.
So it's so worker which connects the Kaldi ASR to mediator.
It's on very good way and I I think I can have it finish by the  end of 
week.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so this is the thing that you had also worked on for the project.
For sorry, like semestral project for your-
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
Ok.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Around now.
(PERSON7) Yeah, ok.
And the benefit is that there would not be the need to run the separate 
Kaldi server and instead we will directly launch the Kaldi worker.
Obviously it was like, you will run it on the cluster and it will connect 
directly to the mediator and mediator will then use it when when asked for, 
right?
(PERSON3) Yes.
Yes.
(PERSON4) This is good, yeah.
(PERSON7) Yeah, this because this complicated our set up all the time and yeah.
That's that's perfect.
So there were always the port issues and things like that so this is a good 
good thing to to have.
So the demo if-
So if you're really successful, then we could re include this in the demo.
In the demo session.
Remember, there is 1 thing that no one again worked on probably.
And that's the the diagnosis of issues.
We have seen strange slow downs of various things.
And we don't have a quick way of figuring out what is wrong.
Once it was the overloaded ASR machine.
This should now be easier if we could simply like start multiple Kaldi 
servers and in-
Because they would connects as workers to the mediator and we could kill 
those that where the machines seems overloaded and and things like that.
So this is this is step forward.
But it's still not the diagnosis.
So it's-
I don't know how to divide the work.
Like it's, I know that [PERSON4] is is busy with starting these things and he 
is kind of irreplaceable.
And that's risky.
And we need to have.
Well.
This is this is maybe impossible, due to the Covid crisis because we are in 
in different rooms.
But if we are sitting in the single room, then we could help each other.
(PERSON4) Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yeah. That means <unintelligible/>
(PERSON7) So-
So [PERSON4] in the back of your head thing how-
If if you're like struggling remember we have this for the Zoom Unihack 
planning call.
Where I was on Slack, you were on Slack and and [PERSON9].
And we were trying, we're trying to figure out what what is wrong, why it is slo 
so so slow.
So it was very sub optimal.
But still we were doing something.
So we need to have like multiple operators diagnosing what what's wrong.
And I don't know who maybe [PERSON3] actually then figured out what is what is 
wrong, right?
Do you remember, it's-
(PERSON3) Not not last week, <parallel_talk> Not last week.</parallel_talk> but few weeks ago.
(PERSON7) Yeah. I think. Yeah.
(PERSON3) Because of this issue, this number 2.
Now's-
(PERSON7) Yeah.
(PERSON3) I found out why how to run the AS the [PERSON13] ASR worker on and block the 
whole machine.
It's just once one <other_noise/> one line command.
<other_noise/>
Not the solution that [PERSON4] used before.
(PERSON7) Yeah, ok.
So we, sorry -
<another_language/>
Some bulb needs to be replace this very second.
<laugh/>
Ok.
So back to the-
So this is this is promising.
The back end ASR the testing is good and I think that it will be good if 
[PERSON3] was available to watch the test sessions.
Like not to be all all the time there.
But to be like on demand available.
For the for the demo.
So [PERSON4], can you please summarise there is this demo document.
We should link it actually.
That's here.
When are the demo sessions?
Are there any more.
So preparation for other meeting with [PERSON5], so I'm putting the URL to the demo demo 
document there.
Upcoming demo for [PERSON5].
That's the document.
I'm linking it actually twice from here.
Ehm [PERSON4] please find out when the days and times-
What are the what are the time slots in the coming few days.
<parallel_talk>Ehm.</parallel_talk>
And let also [PERSON3] know so that [PERSON3] can confirm when he would be 
available to watch and really.
We need to do, we have done many tests.
And still we are not with the stable set up.
We are making the progress.
We need to again make well 3 big tests and like crash tests I would call 
them.
Everyday until the demo is here.
So we need to be really sure that we know how to quickly like pull it all 
switch everything off start it on again.
We should deliberately kill it.
So [PERSON4] in 1 of your demo like test runs unplug your internet cable.
You really be, we have to be nasty to the system.
And you need to figure out how to how to fix it.
So I'll put it here preparation for yeah.
So, [PERSON7] asks for many and nasty tests.
Tearing of the internet cable and so on.
So that we know how the system behaves and and how to fix it as quickly as 
possible.
Right?
(PERSON4) Ehm. Ehm.
(PERSON7) So this is this is really important.
Gosh.
Ok so [PERSON3].
Is there anything else?
(PERSON3) No.
(PERSON7) Yeah, ok, thank you.
And we have still [PERSON1] on the call.
So [PERSON1].
(PERSON1) Hi.
This week I'm I will connect with [PERSON3] regarding the the continues SLT.
Because last week he was on holiday.
And and this week I haven't I didn't have time.
To to get in touch with him.
And and I'm I'm doing my inter speech submission and and also my thesis.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
When is the deadline for inter speech? 
If you could remind us.
(PERSON1) I think it's the 8.
Of May.
But I I'm going to check.
(PERSON7) And is it anywhere on Earth, right?
(PERSON1) Hopefully.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> Papers.
(PERSON7) And I have actually one more request on or question on [PERSON3].
In the meantime.
[PERSON3], next week there is again the Kudo conference.
So I'll write it as a to do.
Consider taking part in the Kudo based mock conference next week.
And especially check the Kudo files from the previous one.
Did I share the path with you, [PERSON3] or did I forget?
(PERSON3) No.
(PERSON7) Ok.
So that's my fault then.
Net data [PROJECT1].
[PROJECT1] mock interpreted conferences.
Yes.
It's in the directory 2020 04 yep yep yep.
So this is, this is the path.
I hope it will paste it here.
No again, it doesn't paste.
I need.
Yep. 
Oh.
So here is the path.
It is one JSON file.
And I move this JSON file outside of the directory with the str- stream 
files.
So that it was easier to find it.
But I haven't change the paths.
So this this JSON file will actually contain path to files that are 
directly in the stream.
That are in the subdirectory stream files.
And it it would work as as links if if you like moved it back.
But I don't think it's a good idea to move it back.
So it's not writeable that's good.
Because we don't want to lose the data.
Yes, it's all.
It's all read only.
Please try to make sense out of this.
Unfortunately, I don't think there is any like-
There is a program of the mock conference.
I'll try to figure it out.
But I didn't have the assignment to the cabins.
Because that was in another e-mail that professor [PERSON2] sent only to like 
the interpreters themselves and not us.
(PERSON3) Ok.
(PERSON7) Yeah.
So then program-
<another_language/>
So it says-
<another_language/>
There is-
Ok, great.
So I will forward this e-mail to you.
I'm not sure that you you got it.
So please upload it it there.
And try to figure out what is what.
So, yeah.
So I'm just forwarding the e-mail to you [PERSON3].
Please put the files into the directory.
There is 2 attachments to the to the e-mail that I just sent you.
And please put them to directory and then maybe make sense out of it.
And please confirm to me and also professor [PERSON2] that we can use this 
data set.
Before next week, so that we can-
So that we have a good reason to ask her for one more recording.
She said it was it spend her too much of her data and like took too long to 
upload.
So we need to tell her that it's worth the effort.
(PERSON3) Okay.
And by which day?
(PERSON7) Well, I don't know.
Monday at the latest I would say.
But it's, yeah.
If you can do it earlier would be better.
Because it's on the 12.
On the 12th and so if you.
And I think it could be useful for you to to just see the platform as well.
On the 12.
So in the e-mail ask her for the credentials.
She will send the credentials just the day beforehand or that's what she 
did last time.
So she sent me the the links only on Monday and on Tuesday I took part.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON7) Yeah, great, thank you.
And yes.
So [PERSON1] has confirm the date.
And there is this empty line and that was for I wanted to somehow make a 
note about this this joint set up that [PERSON1] was mentioning.
So can someone write down what exactly was that.
That was something with [PERSON1] and [PERSON3].
What was it?
(PERSON1) It's a just a that you mentioned that [PERSON3] works on continues speech 
translation.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah.
We have-
Like the window based set up.
(PERSON1) Yes, yes.
(PERSON7) Removing window, the moving window translation.
Yeah.
(PERSON3) But I haven't tune it.
So far.
(PERSON1) And it's like a graphenes to graphenes or.
(PERSON3) No, it's text to text.
And.
(PERSON7) Yeah, which is text to-
That's graphene to graphene.
Graphene means means normal words.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON1) Okay.
(PERSON3) And it's it's window of sentences into window of sentences.
And I and I stopped working on it and I haven't try which part is the is 
the-
Should be the final one.
Whether the the first window or the middle one or the last.
So this this has to be tuned.
Try everything-
(PERSON1) Actually, actually I'm more interested in results because because my 
acustic models are into phonemes.
That means that I need to retrain my my own own model that translate from 
phonemes into graphemes.
(PERSON3) Yeah, but.
(PERSON1) So I'm I'm just interested in what what s what set up I or how the 
training goes and and such.
(PERSON3) Ok.
I think I have I have only some negative results.
I can sh share with you.
(PERSON7) Yeah, it was it was not much worse.
But it was little worse than the baseline.
But it was not much worse if I remember correctly.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON7) And I don't know whether you have written this anywhere, [PERSON3].
(PERSON3) No.
(PERSON7) So there is so that's a that's a pitty kind of.
It is in your jour- journal so to say.
So there is the there is deliverables for [PROJECT1] and one of those will 
definitely be on on spoken languages translation.
And that is where the window based experiments should go.
So I'm checking June report analytics, technologies report.
Yes, spoken language translation.
That's the one that that [PERSON12] asked for.
If you remember.
[PERSON3], you were on that e-mail, right?
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so exactly I'll put that here into the-
So, these-
So maybe le let's put it.
Results by [PERSON3].
The negative ones should go into this deliverable.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON7) So please, write it down and you can directly like make use of [PERSON1] as a 
reviewer of of that.
So that it is self contained.
(PERSON3) Yes, but but it's faster if I just tell him.
Or write an e-mail.
(PERSON1) Okay.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so write it in form which can then be easy it to convert it to a 
small report about the experiment to the deliverable as well.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON7) So that you write it directly in in usable form.
That's that's it.
So yes.
Okay, so thanks.
We do not have anyone else on the call.
So thanks to all of you have participated.
I've seen that some of you have really put some details into the surge 
table, that is good.
So please think again if there is anything else that you you've done.
Please populate the table.
Because the time when I'm I would need to like distribute the points and and 
officially decide how to convert point into into bonuses and how to pay 
them.
That would be administratively complicated.
Especially now in in the current time.
And like the administration slow.
So I need to do it early enough so that it gets to you.
So thank you.
And will be in touch regarding the demo and also the interspeech submission 
or or submissions.
We made it, only 4 minutes extra.
So great.
Thanks.
So talk to you next week.
Yeah?
(PERSON4) So. I I'd like talk to Dom [PERSON3].
(PERSON7) To [PERSON3].
So, yeah.
So I'm leaving the call but remember, in in 9 minutes or so it is over.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) Bye bye.
(PERSON7) Yeah, bye.
(PERSON4) So [PERSON3], like okay.
So I see like the wrapper and the <unintelligible/> has the documentation but the directory of <unintelligible/> has has documentation but like it is 
<unintelligible/> look  in documentation I find it quite unclear on how to integrate the MT wrapper with my like day to day sessions.
So can we make <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Integrated with what?
(PERSON4) Integrate with my a day to day my SLTs.
(PERSON3) What what is it?
Is it just one set up script?
One set up.
(PERSON4) No, so how how do I use your MT wrapper with with the MTs.
(PERSON3) MT wrapper has an argument dash dash MT.
And there you use the text text client.
Command.
(PERSON4) Yes, so exactly.
So so then can we find the exact like documentation about the about this.
(PERSON3) Okay.
You can-
(PERSON4) If it is not there then <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) It's in issue number 2.
No, in issue number 3.
There.
(PERSON4) The <unintelligible/>
So can we make another have this document- documentation in the front page 
of your of your MT wrapper.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) In in the simple words, nothing extra.
So and then I think it will be useful for the about <unintelligible/> 
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) And [PERSON7] would would sharing testing sessions test set in slots so 
what of these slots <unintelligible/> I myself have to come to come of the Sunday <unintelligible/> session slots like that.
(PERSON3) No, I I think the best way is that if you prepare the set up scripts for 
some for some event that then you commit them and I try to run them and I 
give you feedback.
About them.
(PERSON4) For some event like <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Sorry?
(PERSON4) What what event can you get it? <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) I don't know.
Some demo, demo event or anything like this.
(PERSON4) Like already recorded sessions kind of?
(PERSON3) No.
For example the meeting with [PERSON5] is is an event.
So I I I think you are planning to use some set up srcipts.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON3) Are you?
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) So you should send me.
You should commit them and send them to me and I give you feedback.
What's-
And I I can start them on my own and I immediately find if anything is 
wrong.
And I get you know or or fix it.
By myself.
(PERSON4) But I think of the <unintelligible/> to share all text sets and source with [PERSON3].
(PERSON3) Yes.
And just like just to let me know when is some some testing event and I will 
be available on the on Slack.
And if you need help then you can-.
(PERSON4) Okay, okay, okay.
(PERSON3) You can utilise me.
(PERSON4) Yep.
(PERSON3) But I hope that everything will be okay and I won't be necessary.
(PERSON4) Yeah <unintelligible/> and maybe the MT wrapper.
And.
So I will <unintelligible/> from like next <unintelligible/> few, on two days.
Like within one or two days. <unintelligible/>
Ok, I think the call will be over so so I think that's all.
(PERSON3) Okay
(PERSON4) Okay, bye.
(PERSON3) So see you.
Have a nice day.
(PERSON4) See you.
