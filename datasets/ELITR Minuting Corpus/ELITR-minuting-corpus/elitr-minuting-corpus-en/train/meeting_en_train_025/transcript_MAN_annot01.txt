(PERSON8) [PERSON3], seems like you may have your names set from a previous call.
(PERSON3) <laugh/>
(PERSON8) Sorry.
(PERSON3) Yep.
So are we still missing anyone?
Uh, actually, we have [ORGANIZATION4], we have all the research partners, we have [ORGANIZATION6].
So it's-
I think that we are ready start, uh, because uh, w- w- well the [ORGANIZATION3] may join, or may not join.
I don't know.
They're not part of the project anyway.
So thanks a lot for uh, for coming to this very late uh, m- meeting before the submission of of the deliverables.
Uh, I hope that you are all looking at the uh, document, 
and I would just like to draw your attention to uh, the of formal rolls,
that I had to write in the most boring deliverable of all, the project management guide.
And uh, there for every work-package, there is someone's name.
So please make sure, that you are not to oppose to listing these names.
This is the 1st time will actually it's write this down somewhere.
And we also have uh, deliv- uh, uh, representatives for each partner.
Uh, that's for uh, the the formal voting, if there would be any.
And uh, in the-
If you are if you are interested, then you can read this deliverable, uh, the uh, the whole project management guide.
And there, I always try to highlight that we rely on your own responsibility and your own activity, 
and we don't really need to to do any voting in any conflicting situations
because we do everything in agreement and we find agreement well, ahead in uh, time.
So I'm I'm grateful that this team of of all of you works as great, as I described in that deliverable.
<laugh/>
I I hope it will survive like that.
Um, and uh, I just send this uh, the the link to this to [PERSON19], who agreed to review that uh, full text.
Uh, so uh, I think we can uh, hope, that even if he is only a very quick with the reading
that the deliverable would okay.
And now, lets uh, go over all the deliverables that are due tomorrow evening.
And uh, I would like everybody, the the main uh, the author of that, 
to uh, talk about it, to tell us what is the status, 
whether it has been reviewed, and with is completely finished and ready for shipment.
Uh, I would like to draw your attention to the 1st page, actually,
where it always state, that that like the cover page the the big table, which says, what type of deliverable it is.
And in the template, there is accidental left the word demonstrator.
And none of the current deliverables are demonstrators.
So it should always state report.
Then, in many cases, the authors are not filled, or or not filled some time ago.
And also, the contributing partners should list the partners, who have been involved in in the work uh, behind that uh, uh deliverables.
And also the date, that should be tomorrow.
So well, the main author, please, always open the uh, [ORGANIZATION1] again
and check, whether even these formalities are are okay.
So um, I'm I'm sorry for being again so immediately uh, uh, in in in the work, <laugh/>
uh, and I hope that you are all doing well.
Uh, so we can uh, really do this uh, uh, a boring part and and and and submit in time, 
and uh, then have uh, well, some relax in the summer.
So lets now go over the uh, deliverables.
So the 1st one-
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) The 1st one is supervised, or uh, was written mainly, uh, or or organized by [ORGANIZATION5], right?
So [PERSON8], you are the main uh, person behind the uh, the ASR systems?
(PERSON8) I I was not the main person by that, I'm uh, think it was [PERSON9].
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So what is what is the status there?
Is it uh, is it fully finished?
Uh, ha- has it been reviewed?
(PERSON16) I think I can compl
(PERSON8) Again, I I wasn't the m- the main module downloaded, 
but as I can as I can see from the document it uh, it's definitely been reviewed,
so I suppose it's been uh-
(PERSON16) So I got a mail, cause I reviewed this,
and it was it was [PERSON19] and [PERSON9], they were mainly responsible for it.
Um, and see, yeah, <unintelligible/> much fine.
Um I got a mail from [PERSON19] yesterday morning saying, that he used kind a go through the changes.
And um, we just had some question about this question about the scope of it, 
because uh, the deliverables called some like- yeah, report 1 on an initial ASR systems.
So [PERSON19] did not include some of the work there, 
especially him and [PERSON9] have done through the reporting period,
and he said, he wanted to keep it that way, 
because he would then reported this work and periodic report.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON16) I didn't-
And I said: „Okay, that's the way, want to do things."
Um, as, long as a report is w
I was concerned that the work wasn't being reported.
Uh, as long as the reports somewhere, I think that's probably okay.
(PERSON3) That is okay.
(PERSON16) What your view in it is?
(PERSON3) The problem is, that we don't have the periodic reports, uh, anywhere among the deliverables.
(PERSON16) I know that.
But they will be done before the review wanted?
(PERSON3) Yes, uh, I don't know know, when they uh, like when they will formally ask for it, 
whether they will at all, or maybe they will not ask for it at all-
(PERSON16) But it will be s
(PERSON3) But it will be-
(PERSON16)  60 days.
(PERSON3) Yes I think it's it's within 60 days uh, after the end of the period.
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Yes.
So uh, normally, like in the past, there was always a deliverable, which-
And I think um, well, there is a risk uh, that uh, o- uh, 1 of the deliverables,
that was originally planned for  uh, a month 6 uh, 
formerly, was postponed by us to month 18.
(PERSON16) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) Uh, and that will be this report.
Uh, so I hope, we can still uh, uh t- the like uh, describe it as a periodic report.
(PERSON16) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) Which will be written after the end of period 1, so after uh, June 30, 
but surely before well, before the review.
(PERSON16) Yeah, I mean it is-
(PERSON3) So in early summer.
(PERSON16) He talked about the progress report.
He would describe the complete work and the progression form, just assume me is essentially the periodic report or the 1, we're talking about, anyway.
(PERSON3) So I'll try to figure out what is uh, needed in the system.
(PERSON16) Um-mm.
Sorry, it's bit late for-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) Within this.
But-
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON16) I would have <unintelligible/>.
Yeah.
<laugh/>
Um, I I emailed [PERSON19] last week, 
and I heard back from yesterday morning so-
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah.
So uh, I have this vague impression, that yes, something could be uh, could be expected from us.
Uh, and uh, I was totally overloaded with the uh, other deliverables.
So I didn't-
(PERSON16) Um-hum, um-hum.
(PERSON3) I didn't uh, oh, uh, hm, I cannot log into the SIGMA portal.
The continuous reporting doesn't work.
It says uh, uh, not found 404, so-
<laugh/>
(PERSON16) Great.
(PERSON3) <laugh/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I cannot look in the in the portal of the moment at all,
uh, but uh, I agree uh, with the experience of [PERSON19] and uh, you as well.
Uh, we will have to provide a progress report, or periodic report, whatever it is the name.
It will have to be ready well, had before the review, 
and we have the review date uh, uh, already uh, [PERSON16], right?
Yeah.
(PERSON16) Yes, September <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yes it's I think like 8th uh, of September.
Uh.
(PERSON11) 8th of September, yes.
(PERSON3) Uh, so I think, that we should we should probably uh, have this periodic report ready by the end of July, uh, uh-
(PERSON16) Um-mm.
(PERSON3) Even if we are late according to the to the SIGMA.
But it's it's about work, that has been done in the past.
So for people like [PERSON19], it will involve a little bit more of writing.
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Because-
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) They uh, didn't put uh, some of these details into the deliverables.
For most of us, we have already put uh, our work into the deliverables because they-
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Uh, thematically match and and then-
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) The a progress report will simply say: „Well, it's in the deliverable, which has been submitted."
(PERSON16) Yeah, I mean, I meant I'm well in favor of not repeating stuff in the deliverables.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) I I think, that reviewers will thank us for not.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) Having access of re- repetition.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, okay, so uh, back to uh, D2.1 on initial ASR systems.
Uh, I- when I browse it it there, yeah, there is just little bit uh-
Yeah.
So uh, so the response from [PERSON19] was that he will finish the edits during today, right?
(PERSON16) U, he didn't s- he didn't think give the time, he just said, he will he'll- 
he thank thanks the review, he's gonna work in the edits 
and he talks about this this this crush-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) In this scope.
(PERSON3) Yeah, because there is still lot of uh, a lot of comments by you, which are unresolved.
So [PERSON8], if you can uh, uh, if you can make sure, that [PERSON19] uh, 
or you, or [PERSON9], or whoever uh, simply finishes uh, all the outstanding questions?
(PERSON16) Yeah, I'm-
(PERSON3) By [PERSON3].
(PERSON16) I think, [PERSON8] wasn't involved in that, was he?
Is that right?
(PERSON8) I wasn't, but I have contact to [PERSON19].
(PERSON16) Okay.
(PERSON3) Yeah-
(PERSON16) S- some someone from [ORGANIZATION8] was involved.
(PERSON3) Uh, that's uh-
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/> from [ORGANIZATION8].
(PERSON3)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
So I'll make sure, that the colleagues of mine will, uh, will do their parts.
And-
Yeah, there is also something.
So so everybody, uh, every author should make sure uh, during today, that these questions are um, resolved.
And [PERSON3], is there anything critical? 
So that if w- we tomorrow uh, the evening-
(PERSON16) No, I don't think that.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) No I I don't think there is anything critical.
I mean, this our a main question, that was about the scope whether we should-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) But you know.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Okay.
So that looks uh, reasonably good.
That's perfect.
Uh, so lets move uh, so reviewed uh, yes, uh, done not yet.
So here, I will say uh, that, uh, uh <parallel_talk/> Every author uh, to resolve uh, uh, [PERSON3]'s questions today. <parallel_talk/>
Okay, uh, then, the deliverable uh, on spoken language translation system.
Uh, it has been f- finished, according to the m- main author.
It has been reviewed by [PERSON12].
So what is the uh status there?
Are there any?-
(PERSON16) I went through the review comment on Saturday and-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON16) And I have I have addressed them.
And there was a couple queries, they went [PERSON8] and [PERSON11].
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON16) Um, just about, I think, uh, [ORGANIZATION6] would ask some questions about the normalization.
I'm not sure <unintelligible/> to-
Well, I I'd like [PERSON8] and [PERSON11] just to a look into the they can resolve.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON16) I think in [PERSON8]'s case it may be the-
I think they-
[ORGANIZATION6] is asking <unintelligible/> evaluation figures <unintelligible/> guess.
We don't have such figures, then it's not much we can do.
This stage um, but yeah, just have a quick look at.
It shouldn't take long to resolve them.
Um, other then then I I can have a- I should have a quick read with the deliverable and then we're done.
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay.
That's great.
(PERSON16) And I I can give you it tomorrow.
I assume, when you said tomorrow evening, you don't really want, 
you don't really mean um-
(PERSON3) A midnight.
(PERSON16) Night, midnight.
(PERSON3) Yeah, uh-
(PERSON16) I assume-
(PERSON3) Well, that that's the last resort, but I would prefer to do it earlier.
<laugh/>
(PERSON16) Well, I know, I know you should say that that it is-
I mean, I'll do it tomorrow morning, I would expect so-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) I assume you're looking a list by closing business tomorrow.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I would been-
(PERSON16) And hopefully submission system is not down.
(PERSON3) And hopefully, submission system is not down, yes.
It is unknown.
So w- we maybe they're getting ready for the flood of re- uh, of deliverables.
Uh, yeah.
(PERSON16) Uh, maybe yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) <laugh/>
Yeah.
(PERSON16) So I I hopefully I get that to you tomorrow morning, actually.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
Yeah.
That's really great.
So I see [PERSON11] on the call.
So [PERSON11], can you just please confirm, that you will the?-
That you have heard [PERSON3]?
(PERSON11) Yes.
(PERSON3) Yeah, perfect.
Okay, thank you.
So that's the 2nd one, uh, so I will uh, uh-
<parallel_talk/> Right here, only uh, [PERSON8] plus uh, [PERSON11] minor answers. <parallel_talk/>
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) Um, yeah.
Uh, then summarization.
So that's something, that we have uh, written up, and [PERSON9] has reviewed.
I don't know whether uh, [PERSON3] you know, anything from [PERSON9], what-
(PERSON16) [PERSON9] is on the call, isn't he?
(PERSON9) Yeah, I'm I'm in.
(PERSON3) Oh, oh, sure!
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah I fo- for some reason, I I I keep scanning the names, 
and you are you are hidden among your books, so.
<laugh/>
(PERSON9) Oh, okay,
Um.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON9) Yeah.
So I reviewed this uh, last week.
Um, I think my main comments were like overall uh, write well, it was e- explained.
Well, um, but there was maybe a a lack of detail in places.
It could have used a few numbers.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON9) If you fill more examples, just to illustrate things, 
and also in there were um, I think 4 papers include it-
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON9) The the dependences.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON9) Those 1 actually even mentioned in the main text, so there should be some kind of link.
(PERSON3) Yes I-
(PERSON9) I- I- ideally a summary of each each paper, like maybe a paragraph, or so.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is some-
(PERSON9) At least some kind of link.
(PERSON3) This is something, that I asked [PERSON10] to do uh, independently last week as well,
uh, and I don't know whether he is already done that, uh, or not.
So-
(PERSON9) I decide, I just took look this morning,
and um, it doesn't look like it's changed since-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON9) Since later.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, so that's important thing.
(PERSON9) Yeah.
(PERSON3) <parallel_talk/> [PERSON10] to uh, summarize uh, the 4 attached papers. <parallel_talk/>
Uh, and then well, with the numbers and illustrations, 
I'm afraid that nothing more will uh, be edit.
(PERSON9) That that's that's okay.
(PERSON3) Yeah?
(PERSON9) Yeah.
That's not a not a big deal.
Um, yeah, I had a few minor comments, as well.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
The the problem is that the the baseline output so far, are so bad, 
that the uh, numbers and and uh, even uh, outputs uh, are not what showing at all.
(PERSON9) Yeah, um, I can- can't <unintelligible/> impression um, as a as a reader,
and yeah, I didn't necessarily numbers I <unintelligible/> an idea of how bad it is slightly.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON9)  A restrictive ex- example like, is it-
(PERSON3) Um-hum,
(PERSON9) Is it almost usable, or is it complete- completely hopeless?
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON9) Our our current state.
And I think, <unintelligible/> get a strong sense to them?
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, okay, so we'll definitely do the the 1st part uh, 
summarizing the the 4 p- attached papers, 
and I'll ask to [PERSON10] to uh, if if he has examples uh, to to illustrate them to-
But I know that he would be very reluctant to do, so.
So- 
<laugh/>
(PERSON9) <laugh/>
Okay. 
That's no big deal.
(PERSON3) Yeah, uh, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
So the next uh, deliverable is by us.
Uh, it was actually written by [PERSON18].
Uh, and that's on the uh, w- workshop, that we uh, prepared, 
but never ran uh, f- at [ORGANIZATION2] Congress.
And I have no idea whether it was reviewed by [PERSON6], or or not.
So [PERSON2], would you would you know?
(PERSON2) Yeah, uh, he needs to review it, not reviewed at at the moment.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Uh, okay, so that's-
P- please, do so, because we still need to uh, like edit do the edits.
Uh, so the sooner you have it, the the better.
W- I see, that we input the slides.
Uh, so obviously, there is no need to like do care for revision of the slides,
but uh, there is uh, the need to uh, to review, the text itself.
If it's uh, complete and uh, uh, uh, if anything else would be uh, would be good to know uh, for uh, the external reviewer.
(PERSON2) Of course.
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah.
I s- I hear, that you have a lot of background noise in your office.
<laugh/>
So I'm happy that you are mute in most of the time this.
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) <laugh/>
(PERSON3) <laugh/>
Yeah.
Uh, okay.
So uh, uh-
<parallel_talk/> This is a very important uh, to be done uh, today uh, by [PERSON6]. <parallel_talk/>
Uh, yeah.
Okay, and then report on dissemination activities.
So is it actually finished?
Or uh, what is missing there?
Um.
(PERSON2) <other_noise/>
What what is miss is um, the description of the <unintelligible/> event.
I don't know uh, which which institutions are organisation-
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is us this is us, yeah-
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> okay, yeah.
Okay, and what we need more is a little bit in the part of outlook 2020 and the conclusion.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON2) Some <unintelligible/> uh, page partner would be good, if we have somewhere.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Input.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So this is uh, so this is for every-
Thank you [PERSON2].
So this is for everyone.
So first of all, I would like to thank everybody for providing their Bibtechs.
I know, that the layout is ugly, but uh, I suggest that we'd leave it like that.
[PERSON3], anyway, if I remember correctly mention that in the system, 
there is some separate the tap, or the publication should be inserted.
So uh, we'll do the reformatting when I'm able to see that tap.
Um, and uh, for now, I think it's it's sufficient as it as it is.
So just everybody make sure that your publications are not missing,
that your public- publications actually made it to this list.
Uh, I send that email uh, on Friday.
Uh, so you only need to put your Bibtechs into the file called Biblio bib,
and that uh, that's it, that would uh, uh, that would automatically include it.
So please, check it actually worked.
Uh, and then, as [PERSON2] said, uh, please have a look the outlook section, 
which is section 4.
And uh, th- yeah.
What what plans do we have?
So we have obviously uh, the Congress as a plan, 
but uh, we also had uh, for example, the Tedx,
uh, uh, we considered the Tedx uh, event.
Uh, and if you have any other such events, that uh, are likely to  uh, to happen,
then uh, consider mentioning them as an option, uh, 
because uh, the more dissemination we do, the the better.
It's obviously unclear uh, if such events will happen in person or remotely,
uh, but uh, just uh, listing them here uh, is good for us,
so that we don't forget about these opportunities and don't miss them accidentally.
So had as anybody have any idea what what we could do?
What would there be any?-
No, not in a moment.
Yeah, I'm also uh, aware only of of uh, the of the Congress,
and actually the MT marathon, which uh, has been silently postponed, it is planned for uh, September.
Uh, and the current plan is to uh, to run it in uh, January, 
but we have not really uh, decided on the main organizer,
because the the past main organizer uh, [PERSON1] <unintelligible/> will be in [ORGANIZATION7], 
and it doesn't make sense uh, for uh, [PERSON1] to organize uh, MT marathon in [LOCATION1] remotely.
<laugh/>
Uh, so we're w- uh, we are not sure, who should be the main uh, person there, 
but I'm mentioning MT marathon because they are really wanted to test the technology again.
So I wanted uh, uh, to uh, to do a live subtitling of English uh, scientific presentations into the many languages.
So that's why I'm mentioning it,
and I think it it's a good idea to put in here, into this uh, deliverable, but uh, yeah.
Uh, I see also [PROJECT1]'s uh, so [PROJECT1]'s subtitling is [PERSON15], right?
Or is it?-
[PERSON14]!
I see [PERSON14] here.
So-
(PERSON4) No, yeah, it's me.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> yeah.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So [PERSON14], you have this uh, this German event, the CCC Conference.
Uh, maybe that's good idea to discuss it uh, now here.
I don't hear you yet.
So maybe a microphone doesn't work.
Is there any chat window?
Yeah, so is-
Yeah, w- wrong microphone, yes, <laugh/> okay.
So [PERSON14] cannot uh, speak,
but uh, I'm n- not sure, whether he emailed it to everybody recently, or only to me recently,
there was this uh, German hackers conference CCC. 
I don't know whether F- uh, [PERSON8] knows about it.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/> very much do
(PERSON3) You you very much do.
Okay, Yeah.
And last time, uh, uh, [PERSON19] was very uh, a- afraid of uh, showing the system to any hackers, because uh, we never focused on security of of the solution.
Uh, and uh, obviously, uh, our focus on the security has not changed uh, much,
but still, uh, I would like to uh, reconsider again, if you would like to try to get to that conference, 
to provide subtitling there because it's it's a nice stress test of of the system.
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) So as I remember, these uh, this is a very large conference in terms of hacker conference, as they do have 9 interpretation at-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
Uh, well, okay.
Yeah, I <unintelligible/> I think that could be good idea, and I think, they'll still be interested security or not.
Um, I just checked their blog and whether or not it will happen will be known in October.
(PERSON3) Okay.
Yeah.
So-
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/> when they will give the the <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Um-hum, yeah.
So could you mention that uh, here,  in the outlook as an option?
That we are like considering, and even all the concerns that uh, we may not be ready-
Wha- what we should be-
So is it uh, is it bigger than the [ORGANIZATION2] Congress?
The [ORGANIZATION2] Congress would be like-
(PERSON8) What is been <unintelligible/>, again?
(PERSON3) Uh, that's f- 400 if I'm not mistaken.
(PERSON8) Oh, definitely bigger.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So-
(PERSON5) H- Hello?
(PERSON3) Yep.
(PERSON5) <another_language/>
(PERSON3) <another_language/>
Um-hum
So [PERSON14]?
(PERSON5) <another_language/>
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Uh, sorry.
Yeah, I've I f- I think, that especially since it will will be held in Leipzig, if it ever happens,
uh, I think it's like 15000 some people like this ?-
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/> was 18000.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
(PERSON5) Like 5 halls and really huge once.
Also, I'm not sure if they've now letl u- let us, but yeah.
I think, it would be nice to have anything-
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) Sorry.
(PERSON8) And I mean, they will want to demo live translation system.
We don't really to do <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yes, exactly.
(PERSON5) A good point.
Also, yeah, it a an opportunity t- to test it on something, because this year will be probably-
We have very few events.
M- when I ask, if we will if [ORGANIZATION3] will be doing uh, anything that uh, uh, uh,
well, where we may be would test, um.
I don't think they have many things plan, so-
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON5) I don't m
Well, it can happen, but I don't think uh, they can plan an international event, 
and then invite us, and uh, um, well ah.
Well, mm, how to say it?
Well the things go slow, so the doing that-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
So there is no chance-
(PERSON8) We does not-
(PERSON5) I don't think the-
Yeah.
I don't think, it will happen.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>.
They they can absolutely like will decide in October,
and the reason they will decide in October is because it's all organized by volunteers, generally motivated more volunteers.
And I think, if they are interested in, in what we are doing,
then they will have no problem uh, inviting us in October and and organizing all that stuff.
O- or we o- 
Inviting us on the actual event.
That's that's the point of mechanism.
They'll they'll said then yeah.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON5) If they are interested.
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay, so [PERSON8]-
(PERSON8) Yeah.
(PERSON3) I would like to ask both, [PERSON8] and [PERSON14] to keep uh, an eye on that
uh, because I'm may forgot forget, and I may not look uh, at it in October.
So lets not miss this opportunity.
Lets lets uh, uh, lets plan trying it.
Uh-
(PERSON8) I I can say, ahead of time that while I'm interested, 
I don't think I would be able to attend, actually.
(PERSON3) In person?
(PERSON8) Yeah.
(PERSON3) I don't know the dates myself, so it's uh-
(PERSON8) It's it's between Christmas and New Years.
(PERSON3) Oh, yeah, well, I know that I won't be able to uh, to attend.
So-
<laugh/>
I'm I'm tot- I'm totally busy with uh, with a family during that time.
Uh, so and also [PERSON15] uh, will be already in Germany by then, 
<censored/>
Uh, and-
<laugh/>
Yeah.
Uh, and um, he uh, over the Christmas the break, he could actually help us.
So this is this is more promising.
<laugh/>
I don't want to uh, to uh, to commit [PERSON15] to anything without uh, his 1st uh, 1st discussing it with with him so.
So, but there is the the option, and we are trying to get um, substitute uh,  people, obviously.
Uh, so so if w- that that is definitely necessary for the [ORGANIZATION2] Congress.
So there [PERSON15] will try to get back to [LOCATION1] for the [ORGANIZATION2] Congress
and gets like uh, an excuse from missing some of the lectures in in Saarbrücken,
uh, but we need someone, who will uh, regularly uh, test the systems before the event.
So I'll let you know uh, when when I successfully have a person.
I have 1, who is the very skilled, but he is now still in [LOCATION2],
and and it's very uh, difficult to to get him over.
Uh, so we'll see.
Uh, so this is work in in progress on the on the management uh, point of view.
Uh, so uh to to conclude the events uh, I've uh, edit the CCC in Leipzig, 
uh, the MT marathons in [LOCATION1], like a placeholder for that, into the section.
Uh, and also the regular Monday seminars.
Uh, I would like to ask others to add uh, their other ideas,
uh, so the-
If you know about Tedx uh, or anything, then please, propose these opportunities.
And that's probably it.
Uh.
So [PERSON16] was reviewing this deliverable, uh, right?
So was there anything else that uh, that was like uh, bad and should be fixed uh, before sending it?
(PERSON11) Well, I fixed slightly the the executive summary, and then-
It-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
It it is the a c- complete paper and- like complete document and if if if there is- if the deliverable is too bad, then the reviewers will tell us and we will have to uh, redo it.
Uh, that that has happened in other projects in the past,
and it's not too bad if if it's just 1 deliverable.
But this 1 is like actually, um, I think it's fairly uh, complete, it's it's lengthy and-
(PERSON11) I tested 1 section is missing there.
The-
(PERSON3) What?-
(PERSON11) The 1st one the <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah, the J <unintelligible/> yeah, yeah, that's us.
Uh, okay.
<parallel_talk/> So uh, here to summarize, uh. <parallel_talk/>
So it was actually reviewed, yes.
But what is uh, what is needed is <parallel_talk/> uh, everyone uh, propose outlook on events and that's especially [PERSON8]. <parallel_talk/>
Uh, maybe F- it would be better I think, if [PERSON8] writes about CCC uh, than [PERSON14].
<parallel_talk/> Uh, uh, [PERSON8] to write about CCC uh, [PERSON17] about uh, [LOCATION1] events, um. and then uh, what else was there?
No, that was it. <parallel_talk/>
Yeah. 
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/>.
Sorry, well, I guess we're missing Metaphorum because we did-
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
Uh, so uh, do you know anything about it?
I'm not following any updates.
(PERSON16) I I was there, but yeah, that was all I know about it.
Um-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) No matter-
No no for I look, in fact we attend Metaphorum.
(PERSON3) Oh!
Yes.
(PERSON16) It's no there.
I mean <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/>
No there.
(PERSON16) Is it is it suppose to cover all events that we attend at all.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) But lead-
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) Is that right?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON16) Not there, um-
(PERSON3) Well, the uh-
I'm afraid, it could be missing.
(PERSON16) Um.
Okay, let me go.
Papers, we don't have to include conferences, then.
Because that would just be-
(PERSON3) Yes, exactly.
We don't have to include confrences.
(PERSON16) Ah, okay.
Um-
(PERSON3) And this, I've asked [PERSON6] to do uh, spell-checking,
and uh, h- this is still- this is not been done yet.
<laugh/>
So the uh, uh-
Actually, uh, [PERSON2], would you uh, whether the uh, the table, 
that we are collecting in the continuous reporting,
whether this has been checked uh, like item by item?
So that the non-scientific events are uh, are there?
We have this-
(PERSON2) Mm, good question.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Um.
I don't really know, no.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, so that's exactly the Metaphorum, that's colon 0.
So the-
Uh, I'll copy paste uh, the sheet here.
<parallel_talk/> So it is an ugly dissemination activities uh, in our table. <parallel_talk/>
So about the Tedx, I I see also that uh-
[ORGANIZATION6], you w- were you at that at that Tedx e- event?
And did you somehow present [PROJECT1]?
Obviously-
(PERSON7) Yes, actually we we we were not on the stage, 
we presented the project to the audience during the breaks of-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON7) Of the show.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON7) And um-
Yes, and we present the <unintelligible/> video, and we talked about it with people.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
And this is not in the deliverable either, right?
(PERSON7) Mm, I I were trying to check it, mm, but we didn't.
<laugh/>
It's not.
(PERSON3) Yeah, it's not, it's not.
O- okay, ah, that's too bad then.
Because it's uh-
If we have already done some activity and we are not reporting in, 
that will be missed and it we would not get the credit for that.
So it's like to asking-
(PERSON7) Okay,
(PERSON3) Not asking for your salary at the end of the month.
Uh, so-
<laugh/>
(PERSON7) <laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Uh, so uh, then uh, the question is actually, [PERSON2], would you uh, would you be able to uh, to process the table somehow?
Or what uh, what is the best uh, take on that?
W- in the table we even have these uh, these strange numbers.
Uh, so um.
Do we want uh, w?-
What what's the easiest way of listing this?
I think that uh, we should not provide too much detail, 
but we should not miss any of the events.
Uh, so [PERSON2], could you please make sure uh, that there is uh, also-
As as we have like like the boring list of the uh, scientific dissemination, all the papers,
that we also have uh, uh, a boring list of uh, like non-scientific uh, dissemination activities uh, at the beginning of uh, of this uh, section.
And that all the relevant columns uh, from uh, the [PROJECT1] continuous reporting table uh, 
the the google sheet appear there.
Uh, and w- w- 
That there are not even uh, details about it, just mentioning like [PROJECT1] was present at this Metaphorum uh, 2019
and [PROJECT1] was present at this [PROJECT2].
(PERSON2) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) So just make it a list of uh, list of lines uh-
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Uh, and uh, when you where you know, it would be nice to add uh, 5 words of description where you do not know, then leave it just as a as a bullet point.
And then be- bellow this list, there should be the more details about the events, which are already described.
It's like uh, a little bit assorted, 
so that we are not talking about the most important events in detail,
and uh, we are talking about small events in in much more detail, uh, lets live with that.
Uh, but uh, we have to have a complete list uh, at the beginning uh, of that section.
So [PERSON2], please-
(PERSON2) Of course.
(PERSON3) Please ad this-
(PERSON2) Yeah, we will have a something like an overview of all events and then how?-
(PERSON3) And then the details.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So please, do it also today, so that tomorrow in the morning we can polish uh, whatever type setting issues-
(PERSON2) Of course.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> and things like that.
(PERSON2) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So uh, here I will add in uh-
<parallel_talk/> [PERSON2] [PERSON2] to make a list of events uh, uh, at the beginning uh, of non-scientific uh, dissemination. <parallel_talk/>
What is the nicer nicer way of saying non-scientific?
<laugh/>
Like a-
<laugh/>
Uh, yeah.
Uh, okay.
Uh, so uh, this will be to to again done today, and tomorrow uh, we will finalize it uh, during our review of uh, of that.
And the last deliverable that we have uh, is the project management guide, 
which was finished just this morning.
Uh, and [PERSON19] will hopefully review that.
Uh, and uh, by the end of tomorrow, we will uh, send it, so that's what I've talked about uh, at the beginning.
Make sure, that you are not opposed to your names being listed there.
But you are doing the job so the-
You should not be opposed.
<laugh/>
Uh, and uh, I don't thi- I don't see, there is anything critical there.
Uh, hopefully [PERSON19] will sill uh, will still send me the the feedback.
Uh, yeah.
So let me try the uh, the continuous reporting again.
Mm, no, no, doesn't really work.
Uh, so uh, I don't know if you have any further questions to the deliverables or not?
Yeah, no it- now it's now it's totally uh, crushing.
Uh, so uh, we will hopefully finish smoothly this and submit all the deliverables uh, tomorrow.
Uh, we will have to ask you for all the financial details, which we already have asked
and also the uh, the p- progress reports uh, which primarily will say: „All is describe in this deliverable and this deliverable."
And and and so on.
Uh, but some people like [PERSON19] will have to uh, uh, add some more details.
Uh, and uh, my internal idea is to have uh, to ask for this uh, uh, details by the end of July,
uh, so that we can smoothly uh, s- send it for uh, uh, to to the to the reviewers uh, at the end of July or very early in uh, in August.
And then we can run review in uh, early September.
And for the uh, review uh, we should actually uh, prepare that.
Every w- every work-package, we will have to provide some overview ourselves, 
for the uh, for the whole project.
And each partner will have to uh, or each representative of each leader of work-package will have to collect the information from all the partners, who contributed.
So there will be-
We'll prepare an agenda and as we had for the pre-review.
Uh, again, every work-package will be presenting.
Uh, so please, plan that and plan to prepare uh, these presentations.
And I think, that uh, we should probably uh, do a pre-review uh, like a early the the week before.
So what about Friday the the 4th of September?
Would that work for you?
(PERSON16) Uh, so On- [PERSON17], remind this th- what what's the day it the review again?
This is a-
(PERSON3) It's 8th- it's Tuesday the 8th.
(PERSON16) Tuesday the 8th of September, and it's online is it?
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) Yeah, okay.
Um, and it's all in a 1 day.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) Okay.
Um.
Right.
Yeah, I mean how in a [LOCATION1] is week before <unintelligible/> is like a good idea, cause at least and you have time to-
(PERSON3) To fix it.
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah. yeah.
(PERSON16) And we don't naturally haved have a look [LOCATION1] just on 1 day?
(PERSON3) That's right.
Yeah.
(PERSON16) I mean in in fact <unintelligible/> project because it's June and summer will be <unintelligible/> as no way they can-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON16) Be with children.
Couldn't commit having whole day free.
The manager split the review up and it's in 3-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON16) In our sections.
But it's-
(PERSON3) Oh.
E- even even the official review is split?
(PERSON16) Yeah.
Yeah.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
(PERSON16) U- um, I think, I'm okay with having a full day review, 
I don't have every else fells like a bad but-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
So we'll uh, anyway, we-
(PERSON16) But-
(PERSON3) We'll probably sent the doodle poll about this.
Um, but-
So [PERSON16], please uh, please take a note uh, and uh, lets ask about it uh, to uh-
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) To everybody.
So that they are fine with that, but uh, the uh, like dry run should be ideally on Friday the 4th.
(PERSON16) Yeah.
(PERSON3) <parallel_talk/> Dry run uh, of- <parallel_talk/>
(PERSON16) Well, the reviews are sent and choose uh, okay.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) So even I am I uh, I mean that that I m- mean so you're under the pressure to fix your presentations at weekend so-
(PERSON3) Yeah.
You could even-
(PERSON16) I would fix sometimes during that week or-
(PERSON3) So you do <unintelligible/> earlier?
Earlier than the Friday?
(PERSON16) Yeah, I mean Friday is probably okay, 
I mean when you have Monday to fix your presentation.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) You'd not be busy if you not work on it at weekend.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) Uh, so so it's probably okay.
But no later within from a day.
(PERSON3) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON16) It's the it's the latest day, I count it.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON16) Thanks.
Um-
And that-
So so that's review and <unintelligible/> some meeting with the advisory committee was-
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON16) Not.
(PERSON3) Uh-
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/> yet.
(PERSON3) That's not fixed yet.
(PERSON16) <unintelligible/> followed that.
(PERSON3) Definitely and uh, uh, according to the doodle poll, which m- several people, who should be on the uh, advisory board have not responded to yet.
Uh, it it  so base on the current votes uh, the late August, the 19th of August looks best.
Uh, so that is my preference now,
but I still uh, probably need to ask the uh, ask again the uh, those, who have not responded.
So it is definitely not going to happen today.
<laugh/>
(PERSON16) <laugh/>
I was good.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) <laugh/>
(PERSON16) Um.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
So there is-
During the summer we will have to collect all the um, um, materials for the review, uh, which is a financial stuff.
And for all of you this will be a little bit of work, like for your financial uh, departments, at least.
Uh, we expect these uh, details uh, from you to arrive uh, in mid-July, right?
Or some- somewhere around that time, uh.
[PERSON16], when we we ourselves will have this uh, uh, around mid-July,
so that till the end of July uh, w- we will- we we should have it from everybody.
And uh, very early in September uh, sorry, in August, we should uh, we should finalize it, and enter each to the system. 
Maybe, actually the entering of the numbers in is done by each of you, separately.
We'll see how that works.
Uh, in the past, it was sometimes that it was entered by the coordinator,
and sometimes it was entered by the participants.
We'll see, what is uh, what is the true here.
Uh, and uh, we will have the user and advisor <unintelligible/> meeting, 
uh, and we will have uh, the uh-
We need to write progress report and prepare the presentations for the uh, for the review.
Uh, so there is plenty of time, there's but there is also plenty of gaps, where you cannot really work during uh, the summer.
Uh, so it's it's balanced, it's uh, it's doable, but not not too not too comfortable.
<laugh/>
(PERSON11) Yes, and uh, we've the-
[PERSON2], we've the-
[ORGANIZATION4] financial department, probably it's better to warn them ahead because-
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON11) So far, I-
You know.
<laugh/>
It takes a more time than to other partners, so to have the numbers really ready.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON11) So you probably should start <unintelligible/> them earlier.
(PERSON2) Okay, yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Maybe you know.
So in the end, did we get the preview numbers from uh?-
No, not yet.
Okay, yeah.
So we got uh, the the preview numbers from everybody and uh, except for [ORGANIZATION4],
and that's uh, that was the purpose of the test to see that you know, 
who are you accounting people and they know, how to fill these tables.
So it succeeded for everybody except [ORGANIZATION4], who are still uh, uh, preparing that.
So now, getting the update with the full final uh, numbers uh, after the end of uh, June uh, should be easy for you.
Uh, still we need to compile uh, that together and uh, yeah, at at the one missing partner.
Okay, uh, so I think that's it.
Uh, I'm not sure if we'll uh-
Well, we'll be in touch by email,
uh, and I expect uh, that your response time will be now uh, rather than the next business date will be like the next week because I can uh, accidentally ask you, <unintelligible/> or away.
Uh, so I'll- we'll plan uh, things some more- was some more time ahead.
Uh, w- I think that uh, no call will uh, be done over the summer uh, except for any emergency.
Uh, but we uh-
Even before the summer starts, so in the uh, in in the re- till the end of this week, uh, we should uh, figure out the date for the dry run, for the for the review.
And that will be- so we'll uh, see each other uh, only for this dry run, for the review after the uh, summer, right?
Okay, so thanks uh, I think, that's everything from me,
uh, and please, start finishing the deliverables, so that I can submit them in in time.
Okay, so thanks for <unintelligible/> and when we are enjoying summer.
<laugh/>
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON2) Thank you.
(PERSON3) Bye, bye.
(PERSON7) Bye guys.
(PERSON16) Bye.
(PERSON11) Bye.
(PERSON4) Bye <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
