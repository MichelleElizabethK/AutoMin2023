(PERSON8) Uh.
Hi [PERSON6].
Mhm.
(PERSON1) Hello.
(PERSON8) Mhm.
(PERSON6) Hi guys. Hi guys.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
So we are very loud speakers.
Uh, so we will have to mute ourselves probably, uh, to avoid echoes whenever we are not, uh, talking.
Uh, yeah, so [PERSON1] has worked on the whole set up, uh, uh, I was sure that we don't have the long microphone.
Do we?
No we don't.
So, I'll try what what we can do.
We could do.
No that's for the playback. 
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) It's-.
That's for playback for a through a VDA.
Well, uh.
So, so [PERSON6], the idea, uh, well we're still waiting for others.
But the idea is that everybody organises the screens and we should do it as well.
Mhm, so that we will be watching the video in one window and have the subtitles and the, uh, paragraph view in the other window.
And what is new is that, uh, for German, right?
We have three- eh, eh, for English as well?
(PERSON1) Yeah, for English and German. 
(PERSON8) For English and German we have three different levels of flick-, uh, of flickering, uh, so we'll see which of them we, eh, we like better.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/>
In the three different flickering time in the presentation platform and the only one available in the, uh, online text flow.
Hi.
<laugh/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah.
So I didn't hear, uh, the beginning of your sentence.
Uh, I think you were saying that you, uh, you prefer to have three different flickers in subtitling, and only one, the high actually-.
(PERSON6) Hello.
I I since, I'm not that good in German I configured my, eh, desktop, uhm, configuration in order to have the three different English subtitle flickering times in the presentation platform, and the only one available in the online text flow.
And I I cannot provide you feedback for the German one sorry.
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) Yeah that's that's that's okay.
It's just for our interest anyway.
Uh, okay.
So we are still waiting for others I'm afraid.
And I am in the-.
(PERSON6) There is [PERSON5] coming maybe.
<unintelligible/>
And we do not have our setup on the screen.
So maybe if you could do the screen set up <unintelligible/>.
Well, what we are watching.
Do we have the the right setup?
The video and next to the, ehm, the-.
(PERSON1) Everything is set. unintelligible>
(PERSON8) No, in this one.
Because this one, this one doesn't need the pretty view.
This one needs only to generate the sound.
(PERSON1) Mhm.
So, and I'll- make use of-.
<unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON1) So, we will be sharing our screen then?
(PERSON8) So, this is this is for <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON1) Oh, so we should be logging-in?
Ah, okay.
Alright.
That's my guess.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON1) Oh, hi [PERSON6].
Excuse me.
(PERSON6) Tell me.
(PERSON1) Yeah so, uh, using the-.
So in the [ORGANIZATION6] presentation platform I'm unable to log-in using the user <other_noise/>, uh, details that you provided in the [ORGANIZATION4] document.
(PERSON6) Oh really? 
Let me check it again.
(PERSON1) Yes.
(PERSON6) Right.
<unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON8) Does it work?
(PERSON6) Uh, maybe you copied also a space before the, in the username.
(PERSON8) Oh, could be.
Yeah.
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON8) Yeah, that's it.
<laugh/>
Yeah it works.
<laugh/>
There was that-.
What was it.
<parallel_talk>
<unintelligible/>
Where is this place. 
How do I change- <unintelligible/>.
Extend.
<unintelligible/>
That's this magical button.
Yeah.
<unintelligible/>
Because the "extend" gives us the high resolution there, yeah.
(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>
Of that window-.
(PERSON1) Let me do it.
Oh, okay.
</parallel_talk>
(PERSON8) So do we have everybody on the call or are we still waiting?
(PERSON1) So we have here-. 
The <unintelligible/> is out and drag this entire window-.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON8) And one more thing.
(PERSON1) And I'll arrange.
(PERSON8) So we still have only-.
Uh, and then, uh.
Okay.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so I I will <unintelligible/> this window.
(PERSON8) And I think you also need to <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<unintelligible/>
I'm doing that.
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
<another_language/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) When do you get started.
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Okay.
Let's let's redo it.
First try whether it transcribes.
(PERSON1) Uh, someone should be able to-.
(PERSON8) To click into the different areas.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) At the same time- <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Mhm, yeah, so we, uh, so.
(PERSON1) And to make it easier for you.
Just have to, click, ehm-.
Just like press the space.
(PERSON8) Press the space?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay.
Yeah, so.
So, three, two, one, click.
<laugh/>
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
(PERSON1) Shall I pause it?
(PERSON8) Le let's pause it simultaneously.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So [PERSON6].
Uh, uh, are you, are you on the call or not?
(PERSON6) Sorry?
(PERSON8) Yeah.
So we we had-.
We already started it here simultaneously for ourselves.
And for the subtitling.
And we did it as like a little test.
Uh, but we did not synchronize with you, and also no one else joined the call so far.
(PERSON6) Oh, oh, well, uh, [PERSON8] don't worry.
Eh, since through the Pick&See platform I heard you starting the video.
(PERSON8) Okay.
(PERSON6) And I also able to hear the the video playing so that I do not even need to play my own local video.
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) Okay okay okay.
That's.
Okay, that's interesting.
Yeah, uh.
So our screen-. 
Uh, I will try sharing the screen.
What we are looking in, but that will be-.
<parallel_talk>
Share my screen, uh, select window or the screen.
Screen.
Entire work.
Do I, oh, the I'll share screen to.
And that's the one, yeah.
</parallel_talk>
(PERSON8) So if you see it now.
This is our set up.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON8) And that's very cluttered.
So we need to cut it down even for our assessment.
Uh, so, uh.
I don't know what we should avoid, uh.
We should probably focus only, only on English.
<unintelligible/>
Right?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) ... and Czech, because you understand Czech.
(PERSON6) Yes.
I would prefer Czech.
(PERSON8) English and Czech, yeah.
Uh, so <laugh/> maybe if you can also share yours screen.
So that we see your set-up.
(PERSON6) Yes, just let me check how I can do it.
(PERSON8) So <unintelligible/> the subtitles are ok.
We can use many of those and here let's disable-.
What is this one I don't see that.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Oh sorry, I'm-.
I'm not able to share my screen.
Uh, but I can send you, for example, uhm, any major.
Maybe.
<another_language/>
(PERSON8) So we don't switch-.
We know switched to two columns only.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) Both are like quite simple.
<laugh/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) How to share it.
Mhmm.
My gosh.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Okay.
Sorry [PERSON8] I'm going to use also another, uh, <laugh/> different platform for sharing info.
I'm going to upload in these <unintelligible/> live testing channel.
Eh, my actual configuration if you are-.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>
We are not following site.
That's one more thing where we could, uh, share things.
(PERSON6) Okay this is my setup.
[PERSON6]'s.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) <unintelligible/>
We should add?
That one, no.
That one, yeah.
(PERSON1) Okay, so she sent her screen.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8)  Yeah.
So I think.
Your your screen setup, eh, [PERSON6] is better then what we have <laugh/> because we have-
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) Because we have like <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Yes, but actually just because I focus only on English.
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Yes, you will see I'm also trying to record some video here and there.
(PERSON8) Okay.
(PERSON6) Since we always need some some demo video.
<laugh/>
(PERSON8) Yes, exactly that's.
That is good.
Yeah.
Eh.
So let's give it one more try with the, eh, so which video, eh.
So, uh, so in the recording you will not have-.
You will have only the sound of the video that we play.
If you are doing any re-.
But no, you are doing on the screen recording, no sound right?
(PERSON6) Exactly.
Eh, if we need we can <parallel_talk> If we could-.</parallel_talk> try to synchronize the audio later <parallel_talk> Yeah, of course.</parallel_talk> since we had the-.
(PERSON8) If we find it useful-.
Yeah yeah that makes sense.
<unintelligible/>
Uh huh.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Just enable Czech and English in the-.
(PERSON8) There wouldn't have.
We don't need the video anyway like it's-.
(PERSON6) I know, but.
(PERSON8) I will- I think that we need more of this space and that is actually, uh, better achieved simply by-.
With-.
This, this is not disturbing much.
<unintelligible/>
The right one?
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON8) So-.
Oh.
Double click it's too slow.
<unintelligible/>
So which one should I disable?
(PERSON1) Just refresh it.
(PERSON8) Okay.
Refresh it and load.
So and which Czech? 
This Czech?
(PERSON1) There is only one Czech.
(PERSON8) And English <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) So we should have E all of them, right.
<unintelligible/>
Three Englishes.
That's it.
<unintelligible/>
Yeah.
Yeah okay.
And then we can <unintelligible/>
So this is probably the best set up that we can get.
So [PERSON6], I'll now-.
You see our current set up, uh, in our screen sharing.
What I'll stop, stop the screen sharing, so that the the network is, uh, less, uh, loaded.
(PERSON1) I think [PERSON4] is, should be here.
(PERSON8) Uh, is he?
I don't see [PERSON4]-.
Uh, aha, tell him he is on <unintelligible/>
<unintelligible/>
<unintelligible/>
[PERSON4].
Uh.
Are you there?
So you about one, two, three, four right?
So one, two, three, four is probably [PERSON4].
We cannot hear you.
It worked with [PERSON6].
<parallel_talk>
<unintelligible/>
Uh, but, uh, [PERSON6] tested, uh, it was good that we could hear, uh, that she could hear us.
That she could hear us.
She, uh, heard the video playing from our machine. 
Okay, uh, can you hear us?
</parallel_talk>
Yeah, so so if [PERSON4] can hear us.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) And, uh, for [PERSON4] I'll share one more time the screen.
Uh, screen number 2.
So that, uh, [PERSON4] knows what we are looking at.
We, we are looking at different versions of, uh, English, uh, , subtitles for different flicker.
And we are also looking at a Czech, eh, output.
And in the paragraph you we have obviously only the, uh, the single view, there's no no need to change the, the flickering.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) So [PERSON4] can't hear us.
(PERSON8) Oh, okay.
That's strange.
<unintelligible/>
Hmm.
(PERSON1) I think he can follow a chat when it's like <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, I'm I'm using the chat window <unintelligible/>
So.
Hmm, mmm, uh.
Well, then the problem is that we we cannot really synchronise, with [PERSON4] if he doesn't hear us.
(PERSON1) I think I can provide something in the chat window <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
Oh, [PERSON3] is here.
Hi [PERSON3], can you hear us?
Hm.
So we have [PERSON3], uh, but-.
[PERSON3] joined.
Hmhm.
[PERSON3], please confirm if you can hear us.
This machine seems overloaded.
Do we have new charger?
<unintelligible/>
I cannot hear at the moment.
Let me see.
There is a-.
Yeah, mhm.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON1) Okay, so [PERSON4] has texted you.
(PERSON8) I know.
And he says he is trying to figure out some, uh, setting in [ORGANIZATION5].
Okay, so can you hear us now?
Yes perfect, and [PERSON3]?
Are you here?
So [PERSON4] can hear us, [PERSON6] can hear us.
Yeah.
[PERSON3] has his cam, uh, switched off, that's okay, but if you hear-.
If you are able to hear us, then you will hear the French sound from the-.
Uh, that's what that's what [PERSON6] experienced.
She heard the the sound from the from the [ORGANIZATION5] already.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Do we also have [PERSON5]?
I don't know.
Uh, yeah so, uh, that's bad.
<laugh/>
<parallel_talk>
I cannot see video either, just loading, uh-.
Yes, uh, we are, uh, not yet running it. 
Running the video, uh, the video.
But uh, try to change, uh, your settings so that you hear us.
</parallel_talk>
Okay, so let's give it, uh, three more minutes.
And in three minutes, uh, we will start the video.
And then [PERSON3] will have only the chance to watch the subtitles.
Uhm.
<other_noise/>
<parallel_talk>
...don't get our sound by then, you will only be able to, uh, watch [PROJECT1] platform.
</parallel_talk>
<other_noise/>
<parallel_talk>
or paragraph view
It is good to have the paragraph view open, uh, because it will collect some history for you.
Avoid, uh, reloading in the history.
</parallel_talk>
(PERSON8) Okay [PERSON3] disconnected.
<laugh/>
And he is try-
Yeah.
So he is trying.
He is working on the mics again.
So I'm stopping, uh, the shir- the screen sharing.
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
That button.
Yeah.
Uh, and let's.
So let's get started, right?
So here is the- <unintelligible/> that you want to watch.
<unintelligible/> is it the space or is it-?
<unintelligible/>
<another_language/>
So I'll just forge this space button-.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Space or click?
Which will do it?
(PERSON1) Click.
(PERSON8) Click.
So, uh, I'm stopping the screen sharing.
Yeah.
So, let's start [PERSON6].
So [PERSON6] is here, hopefully [PERSON4] can hear us now, I'm not sure, uh, and I'll start the playback and we'll we'll see.
And we'll, uh, keep watching for ten minutes, is it?
(PERSON1) Seven minutes.
(PERSON8) Seven minutes.
Yeah?
The video for seven minutes.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Uh, yeah.
So I'll add-.
<unintelligible/>
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
So three, two, one, go.
<another_language/>
That's it, right?
Okay.
<laugh/>
So-
<other_noise/>
Yeah.
I'll, I'll stop it.
I'll try to stop it.
<unintelligible/> Sorry.
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
Ok, so, uh, who, uh, who we have on the call?
We have [PERSON6], who can speak, right?
<other_noise/>
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, yes, yes, uh, there was little lag.
Uh, and we have [PERSON4] who cannot speak, right?
And we have [PERSON3] and probably [PERSON3] cannot speak, uh, either.
Right?
So [PERSON3], and [PERSON4], if you can hear us, uh, then write into the [ORGANIZATION5] chat, that you can hear us.
Um yeah.
So I don't know what.
<laugh/>
<unintelligible/>
Uh, so [PERSON4] is has disconnected.
[PERSON4] was not here.
Uh, okay.
So the only, uh,-.
The only person-.
Oh, he's trying to reconnect.
Yeah.
<laugh/>
<other_noise/>
So, uh, [PERSON6].
Since we-.
Yeah, we'll se whether [PERSON4] will be able to join or not.
Uh, what were your impressions?
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Well, uh, I haven't looked at the video before doing this demo.
So that I, uh, would like to, uh, understand what I'm really able to understand the from the automatic transcription and translation.
Uhhhh, I do not know, if you instead have the list of content presented?
So that you can check me, check I understood correctly.
<laugh/>
But, uh, my feedback is that.
Uhh.
The part regarding dif, I, I, hmm, I identified at least, uhm, three different news.
The first one was related to, uh, COVID-19.
Ehm, they had a an Italian correspondent, uh, from a radio, or from a if I correctly remember, uh, and I probably there were the Prime Minister, uh, speech of the last days translated? I don't know.
Translated in French.
The second news.
I don't get the topic.
But it was a matter of honour, um, between persons, I don't get the content.
And I have to say that the last parter regarding, um, the pension reform, was much much clearer.
Em, and I think I got the point.
Uh, regarding the, uhm, uh, interface usability.
(PERSON8) Mhm.
(PERSON6) Deep the fact that, uh, the presentation platform, not the world subtitle is displayed, uh, was a problem.
Uh, bec-.
I don't know, if it is a matter of resize of the window.
But I think that in most of the time.
And you can see it in my recording video.
Uh, the second line of the subtitle.
Uh, was, uhm, hidden, uh, in the black box.
(PERSON8) That means that means that you, yeah, that means that your font size was too big, uh, given our setting of the number of characters that we put into one line.
So if you changed your font size, one level below it would probably have fit, uh, but the the the final, uh, answer is that it needs to be the logic in the browser, uh, that breaks the lines.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) This is was-.
This was a not that nice.
I enabled all the three, uh, English subtitles flickering times.
And I definitely prefer the third one-
(PERSON8) Which was, <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) It was the one, uh-
Which, uh, doesn't flick, uh, too frequent.
(PERSON8) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) Uh, regarding the online text flow.
(PERSON8) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) I really appreciated the, uh, paragraph representation since when I missed some part.
I was able to scroll and re-read what has been said.
What I disliked instead is the fact that the gray, uhm, and the not, uhm, consolidated dypo thesis.
Change is frequent, and it confuse me as, an user.
(PERSON8) Yeah. Okay.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) It works pretty well.
(PERSON8) Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, the that's perfect, that's that's a perfect summary.
Uh, and you were also, compared to me, much better in getting what's in the news.
So, for me it was quite easy to follow some bits from the from the virus news.
But I didn't get the details that there was some Italian correspondent from somewhere, for example, that, uh, I did not get that at all.
I know that there was some number a of, a of dead people, and they were con like they were talking about, uh, how do we keep of trust between the government and the people.
Uh, so they, they were uh, mainly ss preparing the the people, h, to keep the, to, to keep trusting the government.
Uh, because that's the only, uh, security that that you have, in the very changing, uh, situation.
And uhh-
So this was that was quite, uh, followable for me.
I didn't get the the Italian, uh, reporter.
Then, there was something which I didn't understand at all, and I didn't even.
So the you said that there was a topic that you did not follow, uh, either.
You.
And you identified there was it was this thing from the pension topic.
I didn't even spot the the change from the unknown topic to the pension topic.
So I thought it was two topics in, uh, in the talk the the the virus, and then pension, which was totally incomprehensible at the beginning.
(PERSON6) Well, we have to first check it.
<laugh/>
Because I'm not 100 percent sure that there were the three different topic.
(PERSON8) Yeah, uh, so, uh, we have to see what what was the problem.
What was the, uh, the middle topic, uh, if it was something keywork that was missing, so that we didn't get it.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON8) I was lost for pretty long-. 
Yeah.
(PERSON6) I think that there are some, uh, per person names.
Uh, that we missed.
And this probably made a mess in the translation issue.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah, so, so I also realised that when understanding-
When trying to understand the text.
I rely very much on my background knowledge. So that was the reason why I was able to understand, uh, the Corona virus discussion. And the, uh, the discussion about the trust between the patients and the doctors and the governments and, and the health care system and the and the citizens.
Uh, because this is like general world knowledge, and also, I have some knowledge about the area of the current situation with the Corona virus.
Then, uh,  I was totally confused doing the second part.
And then as suddenly the the word pension appeared there.
And that occurred to me that I vaguely know from other news, uh, that there is this pension reform that has just been been accepted in France, or or something like that.
Uh, and there is a lot of, uh, negative, uh, response to that from from the people.
And so there, uh, the key word in the in the output of the machine transitions system, uh,  like started, uh, or brought all the little background knowledge that I have.
And that suddenly helped me to understand somewhat.
But I- uh.
Compared to you-.
I did- I did- I do not have the impression at all that I have understood the message.
So I don't know at all what was the the message from the last part, I just realised that it is about pension reform, uh, pension reforms.
So, maybe your background knowledge on that has helped you, or may- I'm I'm like trying to figure out how come that you understood the last part so well. 
Uh.
(PERSON6) Uh, I get that, well actually, I know nothing regarding the pension reform.
Especially the French one.
<laugh/>
If I, If I- I think that they are talking about, uh, a pension reform to be made in the next years.
And why it's important to make it.
(PERSON8) Mhm.
(PERSON6) And why is.
Yes, why is so important to apply this new kind of reform and uh.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so, so your background knowledge is not any better than mine.
So maybe the error that I made was, uh, I was attempting to like catch up.
So, uh, I was like scrolling little bit back and scrolling forward and, uh, uh, thereby I actually uh, disturbed my own concentration.
So that's.
I think that's the critical point if the user is fully concentrated on the paragraph view, not disturbed by the the gray flicker, uh, and only follows the content.
Then it's, uh, it it works.
You can get the message.
But as soon as you as your thoughts wander, or wal like walk around.
Or as you are trying to catch up with something.
You immediately start losing, uh, the content.
So, uh, this is different from listening to language that you understand.
If you are listening to a language you understand, you do not need to pay attention to it.
And still you get the recording, you get the transcript in your head.
Here to get the transcript, sort of, you really have to read it.
So that's, that's totally critical.
And, uh, I'm wondering whether don't not in the not well  for the Congress or maybe not within [PROJECT1] at all, but whether it would actually make sense to to have your, uh, your mother tongue produced by machine translation, spoken to your ears.
Which would relief your reading ability, and it would give you the chance to, uh, to like have this transcript, uh, collected in your head for free.
In the same way, as as I get it, if I if I listen to, to the radio.
But, yeah.
That's a, that's just a side question. 
So, uh, essentially my messa and my, my take home message from the looking at the outputs is that I could not follow the subtitles at all, because we also had this font too big, because we were juggling with the windows.
And in the second lie was, line was never shown there.
Uh, so the subtitles were of, of no use to me, and even when when I reduced the font size.
Uh, still, it was jumping too fast.
S- So I and I didn't have time to figure out which one is the lowest flicker, so that I could follow the the lowest flicker.
I was, uh, mainly, uh, trying to follow the paragraph view and there it worked pretty well.
But still, there were some, uh, uh, like ugly jumps.
So what was not bad for me was the too many changes in the gray part.
If the grey part is, two or three lines long.
That's totally ok.
Uh, but if the, uh, yeah if the greyish text becomes longer, then I suddenly start reading text, and then it can become disturbing.
And the most annoying observation or most the annoying situation that I had was when this long paragraph, which was dark grey, turned black.
And it made a big jump in the column.
Uh, so that that unsmooth, uh, jump was was the annoying most annoying bit
But if I would decides to ignore flicker or whatsoever, then it's uh, em, and so I would like actually hide it.
So that's something that [PERSON7] is working on anyway.
To have just one switch, which would say," I do not want to see any of the grey output at all." if, if the gray output is is hidden, then I think that following the the paragraph view, is is easy.
Uh, and if we do not run into the mistranslational or out of vocabulary problems, then it is really usable.
Uh, so it is still needs the full attention, uh, but it is, it is usable.
Having said that, the long paragraphs are still a problem.
So we should really focus on the segmenter, uh, so that we have as small units, uh, of translation as possible.
It must not be worse, obviously.
Uh, but if we can go for clauses or something like that.
Then it would do the best for for the user.
Yeah.
(PERSON6) May I ask you to [PERSON1] to share the piper used during the demo?
(PERSON8) Yeah.
We can share the piper.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I I'll upload the-.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Thank you.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah.
And we also have comment from [PERSON4] that the.
He says that the paragraph view is much easier than the subtitle view.
Because you can see the the history.
Yeah.
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, so, uh.
I don't know if I understand correctly [PERSON1] what you are saying.
Uh, you are saying that, and nobody actually follows the subtitles?
So.
(PERSON1) Many people.
I have seen people watching different paragraph <unintelligible/>
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) Yeah, the paragraph view.
Yes.
So so far, we have very little uh.
Yeah, okay.
So [PERSON4]- [PERSON4] is complaining about the the way the paragraph view moved without his control.
Uh, so [PERSON4] was obviously or that's my guess.
[PERSON4] was reading the paragraph view from the top to bottom, uh, and, he would prefer to scroll it manually as he reads.
I guess.
Uh, and maybe ga gather longer delay, compared to the original sound.
Uh, yeah, uh while the sub-.
The paragraph view is now uh, trying to keep the level.
So it makes you.
It makes it easier for you to to follow the most up to date, uhm, the text, or most up to date information, and the history is harder to access.
Uh, I think it is, uh, a yeah it is.
I think it is it is possible it will-.
We will simply, uh, avoid the-.
We will disable the scrolling.
So the new feature that could be considered for the paragraph view is that the scrolling will be fully manual.
So you will be listening and you would be manually, uh, clicking scroll down, and the text will be growing at the at the bottom only.
And if you stopped clicking, uh, then suddenly, uh, like you will stay at, on the page where where you are.
So that's that's-.
This view, ehm, this manual scrolling, uh, is good for people who want to follow everything.
At the cost of, uh, mhm, like gath gathering the delay and also at the cost of having to to manually, uh, scroll, uh, that screen.
But but it's definitely not usable for any setup where you don't have buttons on there.
Yeah I would have make summarisation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ha ha, okay.
So it works for [PERSON3] now.
<laugh/>
So this, this room will get busy with students in fifteen minutes.
Uh, I do not know, the weather ss, yes.
[PERSON3] I don't know whether your microphone works.
Whether you can still say anything.
(PERSON3) Can you hear me?
(PERSON8) Yes, yeah.
Okay, well, you should have rebooted <laugh/> before, before the session.
<laugh/>
That's why I always use this this windows machines that I never use them for anything else but phone calls.
And I regularly, uh, check for updates and reboot several times before the session.
So I spend half half a day is just setting up the machine for the call.
And that, and that works for.
<laugh/>
Yes.
So [PERSON3], did you have any chance to, to, see the subtitles, or the paragraph view during the video play back.
(PERSON3) No, I didn't see anybody,<unintelligible/>.
I saw nothing.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
So you didn't.
You didn't follow the [ORGANIZATION5] or the paragraph view?
(PERSON3) I was so busy to <unintelligible/> to work I didn't <unintelligible/>
Sorry.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, uh, so do we know how good the French ASR was? 
Yes, uh, we have no idea exactly.
We have no idea.
How good the French ASR was.
Uhh.
(PERSON3) Were you able to follow the talk or?
(PERSON8) Yeah that's that's what we discussed.
So this, uh, this session is actually being recorded.
So, uh, you can hear the description of [PERSON6] afterwards.
We will we'll share the recording of, of this.
Because, [PERSON6] was- 
She was pretty successful.
I would say, like half way successful, which is pretty good.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) So I can I can say from this point of view like the the requirement that we had for the the development of this so far.
So on like to translate usually the it shouldn't necessarily be so that you can just listen to, just read the transcription.
And from that, you properly understand.
The idea was always that these ASR systems were developed for us for the lecture translator.
And for that it's like the students are sitting in the lecture hall.
They can hear the the speech, which they don't really understand.
And they can see the the presenter and they can read the transcripts, and from that all together from all those sources together, they will be able to to follow the talk.
So.
And I guess you have the original talk here as well, so hopefully that will be enough.
(PERSON8) Yes, except it was French.
So, there it was a set up where- I, I, yes I do remember.
A couple of words where I understood the French word, and then I spotted it in the translation.
Uh, of so that that is so it is could be similar to the situation that you are describing. 
Where you maybe a little bit understand the original language.
And I think in the lecture translator, if the lecture is on maths, then it's actually easier to to follow.
Because there there the terminology is somewhat more international, than the politics or our, yeah, or regulations, and and management of of of health and the pension reform.
So maybe the synchronisation with the unknown language, works easier for for maths.
Yeah, listening to TV news without pictures is not always easy.
That's that's what, uh, [PERSON4] writes.
Yeah, uh, so I had one more observation, and that was, uh, we are also planning to work, uh, on some censorship.
So that bad words, do not get into the outputs.
Uh, and this, uh, was planned to be particularly important for the high school students, but since the the fair is cancelled, because of the virus, then we are not putting any, any pressure on this anymore.
But I realised, uh, here.
It was in the middle part of the talk, where I didn't understand anything I just spotted sentence, where they said," the whole thing is managed by animals." 
And I don't know whether, whether this insult was really said in French or whether it is-
<laugh/>
So, I'm, I'm mentioning this because our censorship whatever it is, it will definitely have no chance in spotting, uh, such insults as "the whole thing is managed by animals".
<laugh/>
Yeah.
Okay, so we've gained a few, a few new things to.
Ah, [PERSON3] we, we getting to see you.
That's amazing.
<laugh/>
Yeah.
So let's, les't digest what we have learned from this lesson.
We'll share the recording of of this but it does not include the-.
So [PERSON6] has the screen cast of the subtitles, right?
So [PERSON6]'s video in synchronisation with the recording of this call would be th- the best way to to look at it.
If you want to replay, uh, replay that session, uh, just as a reminder of what we have observed.
And, uh, what, how how do we proceed, uh, uhm, in like with this goal in, in the future.
So the goal of this of this French watching session, was to assess the real usability for the users.
So how do we work on the real usability?
We know how to proceed in ASR model improvements, in segmenter model improvements.
We have gained a few tips for the user interfaces here, what to do.
I think that the best set up, [PERSON6] that you can-.
That you should focus on is the, uh, uhm, is the combination of that paragraph on in the side pane, and then the video or the slides in the in the main pane.
(PERSON6) Actually, I can-.
I would like to test a different kind of a- we already talk about it.
Different kind of presentation approach, uh, which she introduced a small delay, but based on our experience, makes the subtitles be a real subtitles and much more readable, uh, for the end user.
This is the reason I ask the [PERSON1].
(PERSON8) The pipeline.
For the pipeline would like to try to make some, some test.
Maybe next week, or today.
Ehm.
Let's see.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah, okay.
(PERSON6) Yes. We are also going through the revision of the presentation platform.
<unintelligible/>
Ehm.
So this was really interesting also for the user experience of the web application.
(PERSON8) Yeah, yeah.
So so [PERSON4], [PERSON4] was successful in finding the French original.
Well, the the the surround script, I guess?
As I don't, I'm not able to read it.
And I don't know whether "gérés" means is governed or run by or managed by.
I recognised the animals.
And so maybe it was an ASR error.
Uh, so, so, back to my question, uhm, for the usability?
How do we proceed with the overall usability.
I suggest that not in, not the next week.
But maybe in two weeks from now, uh, when we had gathered some further improvements again.
Across the board.
We should try another French watching session, uh, but we should focus on more things.
A so.
We should be better prepared in in the sense that we would, for example, be able to measure the ASR qual-.
Ehm, we will know the ASR quality.
So we should pick something where there is a gold standard transcript for the French, and-.
Uh.
Yeah.
So this is- 
Yeah.
So the, so the next French watching session should be run on the test set which we have objective measures for.
So that's, that's it.
So we-.
This is what we are working on for the IWSLT shared task.
Uh, uh, uh.
Em, to solve that's that's a question for [PERSON3], actually, as well.
Have you received the mail by [PERSON2] and for [PERSON4] as well.
That we are like working, or putting together a submission to the share task, which I'm organising, and it is still not not not ready properly.
Uh, but the [PROJECT1] system should be evaluated by objective measures in in that.
In English to, uh, Czech and German translation.
And, uh, with these objective measures, uh, in place.
We should run the next French watching session as well.
So that would be French to Czech and German and English.
For example.
So another set up, but the same technical tools.
And, uh, the we should, uh, use this for the next transition net next  French watching session to establish, uh, uhm, relation between our observation our impression and the objective measures. So that we know how good or bad ASR word error rate of of six is and, uh, how good a bleu score of of forty is.
So whatever the numbers are.
Yeah.
So this is.
Yeah.
So let's let's let's plan it like that.
<unintelligible/>
Sorry?
(PERSON3) There is an alternative <unintelligible/>.
<other_noise/>
<unintelligible/>
Ant the others can follow <unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) I I didn't get.
Sorry because of the song, sound quality, so, no no no its its like-.
It's okay.
But it is it is just speak slower.
And the yeah that's it.
(PERSON3) Well, instead of having a talk with the gold transcript we could have a talking say in German or Czech.
That someone wants to understand and the rest tries to follow and the native speakers can estimate how good the match to what is said is.
(PERSON8) So what you are saying, that native speakers would be watching the ASR and checking the ASR quality, uh, and speakers who do not speak the language would be checking the, uh, the translation quality, uh, but-.
(PERSON3)  But the native speakers can also check the translation.
(PERSON8) You can do it at the same time.
So that's that's the problem of, of like, uh, overload of of the brain.
But we have we already have a number of Czech talks that were transcribed.
So, uh, we can-.
We would.
Yeah, ee, we will figure out which which of the source videos would be the best.
Czech could be an option because we have the transcriptions.
If we find something from the European Parliament, uh, which is in French.
Then we can do it there as well.
And I would slightly prefer to follow a language that I do not speak.
Then I-.
Because then I have the-.
Then I can make my own assessments as well.
Yeah.
So Italian.
I would be happy with Italian.
<laugh/>
If we chose an Italian source video.
Then we can also test Italian ASR.
So this is something which we do not need for the Congress, uh, but we the that plan in [PROJECT1] anyway.
I think.
Yeah.
So I think that the the first set, we should try would be indeed, uh, French, because that is one of the languages we need.
Or possibly Russian, which I do not speak either, and we also need it in principle.
Uh, yeah, uh.
So, so, I do not see much benefit from your proposals [PERSON3], uh, because it's the compared to my proposal, my proposal is to select something where we have the objective measures for.
And I think we should be able to find something.
You are probably proposing the simpler set up in case, we do not find anything with objective measures, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so this room is it going to get students very soon.
And I think that we should pack it here.
Uh, and if you do not have any further comments now.
Please still try to go over your experience and put that into the French watching, uh, session document.
And we will share the recording of this [ORGANIZATION5] call and [PERSON6], uh,  it would be great if you could share the the recording that of your of your screen with the subtitles.;
(PERSON6) Sure.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON8) And the I think that it would definitely earlier the regular [PROJECT1] call.
And there we will discuss whether we- 
When do we run the next French watching session.
(PERSON6) Okay, thank you.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
So thanks to all of you participated, uh, and yeah it's it's always a new experience, so it's, I I like it.
<laugh/>
So thanks very much.
And the next time will make sure that everybody reboots their machine a couple of times before.
Before the call.
This this machine is also asking for reboot.
<laugh/>
Okay. 
Thank you.
Thanks.
(PERSON3) Bye bye.
(PERSON6) Thank you.
Bye-bye.
(PERSON8) Yeah.
