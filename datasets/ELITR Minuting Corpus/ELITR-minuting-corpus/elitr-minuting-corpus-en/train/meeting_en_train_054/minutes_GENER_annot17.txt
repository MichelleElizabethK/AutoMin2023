[PROJECT3] Internal
Date: 07. 09. 2020
Attendees: [PERSON10], [PERSON11], [PERSON5], [PERSON8]
Purpose of meeting: discussing project updates

- Discussing a last week's call with project partners.
-- [ORGANIZATION8] representatives were introduced to the current situation of the project. 

- Discussing [PROJECT4] progress.
-- Problematic communication with [ORGANIZATION3] colleagues.
--- Even though the preparations for experiment have been going on for 8 months, there is still only one user.
--- Acquisition of users was supposed to be the main contribution of [ORGANIZATION3]. 
--- We do not know why they are not providing more people, but we will prompt them to do so and ask what the problem is. 
-- No estimate when the experiment will end. 
-- First, there is the need to get actual people to participate. 

- Discussing [PROJECT1]. 
-- Discussing the possibility of moving the models elsewhere, to a different machine during the experiment. 
--- Not recommended, the experiment would be altered by doing that.

- Discussing [PROJECT2]. 
-- Several people in [ORGANIZATION4] are working on a similar project.
--- Once their contact information is obtained, we will get in touch with them. 
-- Discussing connecting the idea of interactive machine translation to [PROJECT2]. 
--- Interactive MT is also related to neural MT.
--- The techniques for neural MT could be therefore useful for [PROJECT2]: interaction with back translation, adding constraints wherever convenient etc.

- Discussing administrative issues. 
-- Because embassies are currently closed, it is difficult to get a [LOCATION1] colleague to [LOCATION2]. 
-- We must investigate whether it is alright that he would come here as a tourist, without a visa.
-- Also keep checking to see when the embassies open, so that he can apply for a visa straight away. 

- It is preferred that the [PROJECT4] experiment and the [PROJECT2] are separated.
-- That is safer for the project.
