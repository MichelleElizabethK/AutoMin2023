(PERSON5) Hello.
(PERSON10) Hi [PERSON5].
(PERSON8) Hi everyone.
(PERSON10) Hi.
(PERSON11) Hi, I'll be back in a second. 
(PERSON8) Okay, I think [PERSON9] was telling me that he's not joining today and other than that I I think [PERSON1] is also not joining today because there's nothing to be uhm handled.
Uh in the administrative area.
So ha ha there were there was a call last week uh and some some of us were participating uh so let's discuss what was what was happening on the call.
I don't know if I should wait for [PERSON11].
He went away.
But okay so in in a nutshell, what happen call.
We were we were uh introducing uh the new representative from the [ORGANIZATION8] to our progress so far, right?
And there was some introductions, some summarization of of the of the previous work.
Uh nothing important in particular.
Like for us.
Maybe one important thing was that the [PERSON2] was is is going to leave the project.
But I think [PERSON5] and [PERSON9] are still properly in contact with the uh [ORGANIZATION3], is is that right?
(PERSON5) Uh, yes, yes, that's correct.
(PERSON8) And okay.
So so now there are uh uh I sort of started uh uh is everything going according to plan?
Or are there any I don't know uh any catch?
(PERSON5) Uh well, uh we prepared the experiment for like 8 months and so far we only have one user.
Which is uh lower number th- of users than we would like. 
And then uh we had for our run of the experiment, like which which we did on <unintelligible/> year. 
So I'm <unintelligible/> kinda disappointed, but still hoping that uh the majority of users uh is still to come.
Because tha- this was the uh uh main contribution of-
This was supposed to be the main contribution of [ORGANIZATION3].
To provide the people.
So I would be very disappointed if only a handle handful of them would join.
(PERSON8) Mhm.
So do we know uh where is the problem?
Why why there are not providing more people?
(PERSON5) No. 
(PERSON8) Uh okay.
And have you tried asking them?
(PERSON5) Uh huh.
Not yet.
Uh I want to give them some time, because urr they appear to be quite stressed, but I will write them.
(PERSON8) Okay okay okay.
So uh that's probably everything related to [PROJECT4], right?
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON8) Okay.
From [PROJECT1], I think [PERSON9] is still running his experiments, he want to- 
Uh his his doing with [PERSON4], so that's that.
And I think he's on vacation now, so so I think there's no problems with that part.
Uh I wanted to- actually, I can ask [PERSON5], since he's here.
But there was uh mhm some request like how how is our s- how is it with our system at at [ORGANIZATION2]? 
Right now, the paraphrasing system?
Because uh uh mhm [PERSON12] was asking whether we can move the models to uh weaker GP <unintelligible/> or something like that. 
Like whether we really need the those titans for for the- these paraphrasing experiments?
(PERSON5) Uh, I was not yeah- I was not included in the spreads so this information is new for me.
But uh uhm uh I I think [PERSON9] set up some batch jobs to paraphrase uh all the sentences and that it's finished now.
And that it didn't interrupt uh the experiment, because that wasn't there was only the one user uh.
And so far it runs smoothly and quite fast.
But well I don't know I don't I don't have any further information so.
(PERSON8) Oh okay, I will ask [PERSON9].
Like the thing is that uh it is not uh- like we're not in hurry to kill it or or m- move it, but uhm we should do something about it.
Like I don't know maybe dismantle or some-
Like they were asking us wha- wh- u- until when we are going to use use the [ORGANIZATION2] for this.
Uh but they are I'll I'll kas [PERSON9]- [PERSON9], so.
(PERSON5) Well-
This-
Uh <unintelligible/> another question as to how long we plan to be open with this experiment?
(PERSON8) Yeah I think that was the question, right?
But we are using it in the [PROJECT4] experiments, right?
(PERSON5) Yeah yeah, yep.
But I meant uh in [PROJECT4], uh how long we are going to collect the data and allow new users to join?
(PERSON8) Well, you don't know right now, right?
(PERSON5) Yeah.
(PERSON8) Because we are still waiting for the people to actually participate.
(PERSON5) Yeah uh but I'll try to write uh [ORGANIZATION3] to-
(PERSON8) Mhm.
(PERSON5) Get us some estimate about the number of people and yeah.
(PERSON8) Yeah but but till the the question I had in mind is whether it is possible to just move the module to a different machine during the experiment.
But that's probably not uh what we want to do right?
Because the-
(PERSON5) I mean it will be possible, but uh I wouldn't recommend that, because-
(PERSON8) Yeah, there won't be downtime, right?
(PERSON5) Uh tha- that's not the big issue.
But we would also alter the um environment by doing this.
Because some users would uh do the experiment on faster paraphrases, some would do them on slower paraphrases.
We should introduce some noise into the data.
(PERSON8) Okay, so I will tell [PERSON12] that we we cannot do it right now and we currently don't have even the estimate when the experiment will end.
I think that's fine.
Like i- it didn't seem so urgent, more like with with the like thinking about the future, right?
(PERSON5) Mhm.
Yeah, okay.
(PERSON8) So so it's all right.
Uh okay so.
[PERSON11] also again left, but yeah, we can we can uh move move on to the [PROJECT2], right.
So hi [PERSON10].
(PERSON10) Hi.
(PERSON8) Uh I I m- made the note that I still need to remind [PERSON6] sending us uh the information about the people from [ORGANIZATION4].
[PERSON11]?
Uh like the- they were they were mentioning that some people from [ORGANIZATION4] are doing similar th-
Yeah, okay, so I will ask [PERSON6], so he provides us with the contact.
(PERSON10) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON8) And maybe some details.
And then I will uh message to you, [PERSON10].
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON8) Uh I don't know.
Uhm do you have something you want to discuss today?
I think you mentioned that you have something?
(PERSON10) And actually I've been reading about direct machine translation and uh-
(PERSON8) Mhm.
(PERSON10) With what I found, most papers ascribe directive predictive machine translation, which is uh trying to predict-
The machine translation is trying to predict and <unintelligible/> warning the target language.
And the user oh is human translator, that knows the target language and he corrects the the this <unintelligible/> when there's a mistake a-
But I I don't know exactly how to connect this idea of interactive machine translation yet to to the [PROJECT2].
However, I'm I wath thinking about an approach that mm I don't know if you we- we are u- using this already with the paraphrasing uh part of the project.
That is to make uh the back translation of the of the sentence and and make the user select what he wants to avoid uh <other_yawn/> uh uh I mean we we have the use the back translation to uh ensure the the the options to the user.
So the user can see what's that he doesn't want uh uh w- w- he wants constrained in the <unintelligible/> you know.
So- but this is the only thing that I uh I thought about, making this interaction of the translation, but it it uh I I didn't know <unintelligible/> because we are considering that the user uh doesn't understand the the target language, right, so.
(PERSON11) Yeah.
Yeah, uh uh I think you've you've made a v- a like very good uh c- you've collected a good impression about the interactive machine translation.
That is true.
The reason why I was pointing that out, uh was uh because uh it was very active uh research area with phrase-based MT.
And I've lost touch with that area since then, so I think it has been also uh uh uh then revived for neural MT.
And the uh the backgr- the back end techniques uh could be interesting for us.
Uh because in interactive uh machine uh translation you are essentially exploring the [PROJECT2] in some way.
(PERSON10) Mhm.
(PERSON11) It's uh I agree just the next word.
Uh but what what to do with the uh with the neural network search could be uh u- in uh good inspiration for us, what we should do.
Obviously we are searching further in the list.
And uh like uh ensuring that we avoid some words or or include some words.
Uh but uh the techniques could be uh relevant.
The techniques for neural MT.
So that's why I was pointing that out.
And I think that y- you probably also uh got some recent more recent papers uh on neural MT and uh that that would be those more important to read.
And for the uh interaction with the back translation, yes, I totally agree.
So the uh uh we had uh the call uh uh uh the [PROJECT3] uh call with uh [PERSON3], the new person from uh [ORGANIZATION8] and so on.
And there someone uh uh it was possibly [PERSON13], the [ORGANIZATION8] guy, was asking uh and I was answering uh what is the interaction of the [PROJECT2] module and the rest of the modules.
And what you're talking about now is exactly this type of interaction.
So I see it as like one more module uh i- in the [PROJECT4] layout for example.
Um and the uh uh you can use the module for of back translation to click on words and indicate I like this, I don't like this.
And uh uh then there will be this um navigation module and that navigation module would accumulate uh these uh uh this preferences.
So uh you would be adding uh constraints uh with uh wherever you wherever it is convenient to to express them for the user.
And you would uh then uh delete them if you realized that they are bad in this uh in this module for uh for the navigation.
So that's like the front end of the [PROJECT2].
But there is also the separate thing, the back end.
And they need to be in like developed uh closely together, so that uh uh like the front end specifies what the fr- what the back end needs and and supports.
But you're you're on perfect track, that's that's very good.
(PERSON10) Yeah, okay.
So I I will try to read uh more about interactive machine translation in the in the sense of the the the back end the use, right.
So I I I w- I read the the idea and thought okay, I don't know if this uh uh has some connection.
But okay, I will I will read uh further.
But I think there uhm then I'm I think I'm understanding the task now and um I will keep uh looking for uh some directions on this.
Thank you for the explanation [PERSON11].
(PERSON11) Yeah. 
Thank you.
And and I have uh administrative uh question, the embassies.
Have you have you checked? <laugh/>
(PERSON10) W- w- w- what happened?
Oh, I I received an email from [PERSON1], is <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON11) Ah, [PERSON1], we pronounce it [PERSON1], so I don't know- <laugh/>
(PERSON10) Oh, sorry. <laugh/>
(PERSON11) Oh. Her name is [PERSON1], actually, so-.
(PERSON10) It is?
[PERSON1].
It's like Portuguese, so okay, I can pronounce that. <laugh/>
But uh well I I didn't send uh her the the document yet, because today is a holiday here in [LOCATION1], so everything's closed and I don't have the document, so- <unintelligible/>
(PERSON11) Okay, yeah.
But the [ORGANIZATION1] is is open, right? 
The-
(PERSON10) Oh, sorry, about the [ORGANIZATION1].
Uh uh the [ORGANIZATION1] is closed.
(PERSON11) Yeah so-
I'm I'm curious if there is any news on the [ORGANIZATION1] in in [LOCATION1] uh-
(PERSON10) No, they they're they're closed and they don't know uh when they will open again.
So I I created a <unintelligible/> to keep checking if they they post any new <unintelligible/> about it-
(PERSON11) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON10) But uh I'm not uh I'm not sure when it will happen.
I <unintelligible/> should be there as soon as possible.
There's an alternative I was thinking about that.
That uh I don't know exactly, I didn't investigate it enough.
But uh as a person from [LOCATION1], I can be around uh I can go to to to the Czech Republic for twe- ninety days. 
I can be there without a visa, so-
(PERSON11) Mhm.
(PERSON10) But I don't know if since this is uh a business trip, I don't know-
(PERSON11) This uh <other_yawn/>.
That's a good question for [PERSON1], actually.
She should ask uh in what way do we n- need you here.
I think that it possibly can help our administrative people if you arrive as a tourist.
But I'm not certain pers- like I'm I'm not quite certain.
So uh is is [PERSON1] on the call or not, uh [PERSON8]?
No, no.
So please t- please like let her know, that you have this option.
So i- if if I understand correctly, you could just catch uh the the nearest the soonest airplane and come over, right?
In principle, yes.
(PERSON10) Yeah I will have to check that, but-
(PERSON11) Yeah.
(PERSON10) Because I can enter EUrope without a visa.
Uhm. 
But-
(PERSON11) Because I-
(PERSON10) I just don't know how I- if this is okay <unintelligible/> tourist <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON11) Yeah, I think that uh I think that the uh uh Czech uh regulation for COVID now would not let you in.
(PERSON10) Oh, yeah. 
That's that's <unintelligible/> a problem <unintelligible/>.
I will check this.
(PERSON11) So that's that's that's yeah, that's another thing.
But anyway, we should investigate because uh because ther- once the embassies are reopened, there will be huge gueues uh for sure.
Like they- in the the processing will be stalled. 
Uh so-
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON11) Uh so [PERSON1] should investigate in any case if your arrival as a tourist would be useful or not.
If it would be useful, then uh when the border is open for uh f- uh like uh citizens of non-[ORGANIZATION7] countries.
Uh b- and I think it's closed now.
So when the border is uh open, then uh uh it would be good if you arrived as a tourist.
But I think it's actually uh more likely that they will say that uh it's more of the of the correct uh type of arrival that we need.
And in that case, it doesn't make sense to arrive as a t- as a tourist. 
(PERSON10) Yeah.
(PERSON11) So but we need to explore the options before you start buying the tickets, obviously, so <laugh/>-
(PERSON10) <laugh/>
(PERSON11) We we need to we need to know what sort of-
Yeah.
(PERSON10) Yeah.
That's a good thing.
Yeah, let's let's investigate that and uh as soon as I-
(PERSON11) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON10) I can go.
(PERSON11) Yeah, great, thank you.
(PERSON10) But about the [ORGANIZATION1], I I don't know, I-
We'll have to wait.
(PERSON11) Yeah uh it's great that you have this watcher that will notify you, right?
(PERSON10) Yeah, I hope it works. <laugh/>
(PERSON11) Yeah, well s- so keep checking every n- uh every once in a while.
(PERSON10) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON11) Okay, thank you.
(PERSON10) Okay, thank you.
(PERSON8) So if there is nothing else we want to discuss, like we can still about the [PROJECT2], but I think we have a separate meeting on on Thursday or Friday.
So-
(PERSON5) Uh c- ca- can I just have some questions?
Uh uh regarding the uh front end?
I should- should I do some work on the front end, or?
Not yet?
(PERSON10) I think not yet.
I have I have to talk to you, because uh I didn't discuss it yet with you.
But uh so far I'm I'm trying to to to think about the back back end of it.
So I I think it's fine.
Uh what we have, the TNT. 
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON10) But uhm maybe we'll have to modify something.
I know that uh uh you won't be around after October, is it correct? 
(PERSON5) Uh no, uh uh I'll still have some part time.
So I'll be able to to some development. 
(PERSON10) Okay.
Yeah, so uh uh I will contact you.
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON10) And we can discuss uh- 
But so far I don't have any any other idea, because uh it's uh to what we have so far, it's okay.
It's uh it's it's fine.
(PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON10) My question is and maybe I just didn't understand, was if this will be uh in the [PROJECT4] later also, or it will be separated?
(PERSON5) Uh, I would like it s- for be separated, but.
(PERSON10) Okay, yeah, so-
(PERSON5) But but we we can discuss this.
(PERSON11) Yeah so, the the reason why we talk about [PROJECT4] uh or [PROJECT4] experiment is because everybody is now familiar with that after all the preparations.
So everybody knows what the modules are, but it's it's just like a point of reference.
Uh and uh since [PERSON5] will be uh remote and not m- not much in touch with the project starting from mid mid October or something like that, I'm afraid that we cannot uh we won't have such a skilled person to run uh another [PROJECT4] experiment. 
Uh with [PROJECT2].
So that's why it's better if it's not uh uh linked uh strongly and not relying uh on on [PERSON5] too much.
So t- uh if if it's separate, it's safer for the project.
If we run a user study with uh [PROJECT2], yes, that will be great.
Uh but uh let's not uh lock ourselves in in presence of [PERSON5]. <laugh/>
(PERSON10) Great, okay.
Yeah, so I'll try to to reach you [PERSON5] and talk to you wh- as soon as I as I have something more specific to discuss.
(PERSON5) Oh, okay.
(PERSON10) But uh so far what I what I what I saw wa- is is okay.
Thank you.
(PERSON8) Okay, so I I think if that's everything we can probably, yeah yeah, end it here today.
So yeah.
Uh it was nice hearing you again, so uh let's see each other next week.
(PERSON5) Yeah, see you.
(PERSON10) Great.
(PERSON11) Yeah, great, thank you. 
Buh-bye.
(PERSON10) Bye.
(PERSON5) Bye.
