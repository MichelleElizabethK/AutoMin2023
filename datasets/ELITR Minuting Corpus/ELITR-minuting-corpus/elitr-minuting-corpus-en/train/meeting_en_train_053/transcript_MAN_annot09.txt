(PERSON4) Thanks [PERSON7] for joining us, thanks to ehm [PERSON3] as well.
(PERSON7) You're welcome.
(PERSON4) mmhm
So ehm - so [PERSON2] w- 
we're going to discuss all the data alright today?
(PERSON2) ehm Yes ehm, do you like me to present which data we have and so how much and how does it look like, yes? 
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
Because I think [PERSON7] is also interested to doing some experiments as - <unintelligible/> in - in our meetings,
so it would be great if you can have <unintelligible/> overview of which data we have and <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON2) Okay, so I will share the - the screen with the table and we'll speak and show you the table.
And if you have any questions, please, ask.
You're <unintelligible/>, because ehm maybe I'm not quite sure what ehm - which information you sh- you want to know,
so just a moment.
I will just turn on the screen sharing.
ehm There.
Can you hear -
ehm can you - can you see that?
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah.
Yes.
(PERSON2) So the link to that table you can find in the agenda.
ehm So you can also open it yourself and use it.
ehm Otherwise -
ehm so it looks like that,
it has ehm different ehm aspects ehm, that I marked.
And ehm -
so two ehm big parts - English meetings - this are all English meetings up to here,
and then ehm Czech meetings.
ehm So as for ehm English meetings, they are divided into groups according to the topic.
ehm Most of our English meetings are form [PROJECT1] ehm - from the [PROJECT1] group.
ehm So Surge meeting, our general report meetings, then some th- <unintelligible/> discussions ehm and something - some - some others.
We also have ehm some meetings from [PROJECT2] ehm and about ehm 10 meetings from the ehm [PROJECT3] group.
This is ehm the group of our Czech colleagues and now they have one Polish colleague,
so they switched from Czech into English, and these are this English meetings.
And ehm this [PROJECT2] - ehm Czech [PROJECT2] is ehm the group - th- the internal group of people working ehm on the [PROJECT2] project.
So this is different from <unintelligible/> calls.
These are just ehm our internal colleagues.
These are the groups, ehm now ehm here we have the duration of the meeting.
ehm This are kind of - this is kind of technical column, that I marked for myself if I treamed it or not,
so I ehm worked with audio ehm and then I gave it ehm to [PERSON6], to prepare the automatic speech reconstruction.
And he ma- he made me the Czech transcript in textual form,
and then I gave them ehm th- th- ehm automatic transcript to annotators.
These are the codes, the first letter of ehm name and surname of the annotator who worked on this ehm meetings.
And then ehm they prepared the ehm correction of the automatic transcript and minutes.
ehm As for correction, ehm I always gave each to one colleague,
and ehm these ehm -
to one anotator, and he prepared - he corrected the transcript and then as - as well as he already knew what was going on in the meeting, he also prepared the minutes for this meeting.
And for -
ehm I tried to duplicate it so to ehm achieve more than one minute ehm for a meeting.
So I gave already tran- corrected transcript, not the automatic transcript but the already corrected, to another annotator,
and he ehm listened to the meeting again, corrected ehm the mistakes if they were there, 
so they mostly - mostly there are some typos- something like that, corrected it and ehm prepared other minutes.
So for example here, for the first [PROJECT1] Surge from 24th ehm January 2020 ehm there were two annotators working on ehm the ehm - the meeting.
A- ehm so we have actually ehm three ehm transcripts - originally done by one annotator and then corrected by second and then one small corrected by the third one.
And ehm four people created the minutes, so we have four ehm minutes ehm of this meeting.
Then we have manual transcript, ehm so this I just marked that we have it so that I can count it in the statistic ehm line ehm below,
I will show you.
ehm This is for the same purpose so I just counted how many minutes we have or-
ehm This is a <unintelligible/> we have transcripts our minutes twice,
and this is the concept duration of what you have.
ehm So the statistics is here, after each language there is a line of statistics.
So generally we have 105 meetings.
ehm The duration - the general duration of all ehm meetings is 116 hours and half.
ehm Put of ehm them ehm we have 76 manual transcripts and 76 minutes.
So this is the - the numbers, actually always the same, because ehm it's kind of rule to gi- give me back c- corrected transcripts and minutes.
ehm And for 33 of of these - ehm 33 ehm transcripts are ehm twice -
33 min- meetings are twice ehm transcribed and 29 meetings are at least twice minuted.
ehm And this is the duration of annotated ehm meetings.
So we have 80 hours - almost 80 hours of ehm m- meetings, which are manually tran- ehm transcribed.
It means ehm that automatic transcripts have been manually corrected and manually minuted.
ehm Well, this is for English.
An for Czech ehm we have ehm [PROJECT3] group.
This a- these are our Czech colleagues.
They began to ehm have meetings in Czech.
That's why ehm many meetings are in Czech and they are here.
Then there is an internal [PROJECT2] group.
They also have begun in Czech, but then ehm - then they get an ehm international colleague and ehm switched to English.
That's why we have also English [PROJECT2] ehm - Czech [PROJECT2].
And this is the [LOCATION1] ehm com- ehm
So this is - this is an external colleague ehm Pra-
how to -
ehm just a moment, I -
ehm <unintelligible/> how to -
[ORGANIZATION3].
ehm They have ehm very nice meetings ehm of different kind.
They're good - very well structured.
And ehm they agreed to ehm record them for us,
so ehm this is ehm -
so we have also meetings from them.
And ehm as for statistics, generally ehm of - for Czech we have 55 hours and out of them 50 ehm -
we have 50 transcripts and 50 ehm minutes.
And for ehm 40 meetings ehm are double annotated.
So we have ehm 40 - 52 hours of annotated meetings.
this is ehm the presentation, please ask.
mmhm Maybe not, just a moment.
ehm I also - I will also show you some other sheets.
ehm This is ehm my table of annotators.
This is the list of annotators.
These people are working for English and this three people are working for Czech.
And here I just write out when they got the transcript and when they gave it back.
So this is just my internal table.
ehm This is the sheet I began to list ehm the people who attended a meeting to ehm to control ehm the ethics -
if the- if they sent the ethics protocol ehm - the consent forms.
So ehm I think ehm it could be <unintelligible/>.
This is all I can present, maybe you can ask me for something.
(PERSON4) Okay.
So, <unintelligible/> thanks you for ehm presenting the <unintelligible/>.
So ehm, one quick question.
<unintelligible/> is ehm. For the shared task ehm do you think that we should be annotating more?
Beause ehm essentially we have ehm -
if - if I'm talking from <unintelligible/> point of view, essentially we are having -
(PERSON2) ehm I can hardly hear you -
sorry, could you just get a little bit closer to the microphone?
If we get from which point of view?
And then - and then what?
(PERSON4) ehm Yeah, [PERSON2], can you - can you hear me?
(PERSON2) ehm I'll try to.
So <unintelligible/> it seems that you're little bit far away, I don't know, what's - what's the problem.
(PERSON4) Okay.
So, what - what I'm trying to say is that you think that ehm -
like I would also like to listen from others that the number of instances that we have currently for the meetings are a bit less ehm from a machine learning point of view.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON2) So what?
ehm I just - I don't understand the question.
(PERSON4) So, I'm asking that the data set that we have currently ehm, we have more annotations, right?
Because I can see we have 76 instances of English data and around 50 <unintelligible/> instances of Czech data, right?
(PERSON2) Yes, yes.
(PERSON4) So ehm I think that ehm for using the data, as far for the shared task we need to do more,
but what should be the - like what should be the exact number we should target, I don't know, but -
(PERSON2) I don't know.
I have no idea how much you should,
how -
I have no idea how much data we should release for the shared task.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so that is something -
maybe we need to ehm think about.
(PERSON2) So, why not the proposition was to use ehm other open meeting corpora ESCI.
ehm each ehm -
probably they can be ehm proposed ehm
there is hardware difference in how ehm minutes ehm or kind of summaries are organised, because what really ehm - what [ORGANIZATION1] corpus has are actually not ehm minutes in our understanding.
They have either an abstact of ehm kind of coherent text for each meeting.
So they have abstract of summaries and this is an - ehm coherent ehm paragraph of text for each meeting.
All of them have some abstactive ehm summaries and these are excerpts of lines from the transcript.
So ehm neither of this ehm refers to what we call minutes.
(PERSON4) Alright.
(PERSON2) It's all then.
(PERSON3) ehm Excuse me [PERSON2], ehm what did you say that abstractive summaries in <unintelligible/> are not related to the minutes that we have for -
(PERSON2) They definit-
no, they are definitely related, of course, but they have a little bit different form, it should be stated.
(PERSON3) ehm
(PERSON2) Definitely kind of close to that, but they have just different form.
(PERSON3) And by the firm format you mean the format that they are saved or format that -
(PERSON2) No, no no, no.
No, the idea -
I don't mean -
seved we can of course convert it anyhow.
ehm But -
so in [ORGANIZATION1] corpus ehm the ehm first of all the meetings are ehm mostly played specially for the corpus.
So 70 <unintelligible/> corpus was ha- ehm played.
Spec-
the meetings were organise specially to- for the corpus to be created.
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON2) Annotator was asked to listen to the ch- to the - to the minute - to the meetings or to the <unintelligible/> <parallel_talk/> Aha. <parallel_talk/> and to write a paragraph of text.
(PERSON3) Yes, I get it, I guess.
(PERSON2) So we don't have paragraph of text, we have kind of bull pointed ehm points that were discussed and some decissions mabe, some ehm generalisations,
but ehm they look differently.
So it could be stated at least.
We can use it.
Definitely they are summaries.
But a little bit different form ehm - format.
(PERSON3) Yeah, I got <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) mmhm
(PERSON3) And something else I want to ask ehm is that: Do we have the access to the participants of each meetings?
The ehm - the thing that [PERSON4] wanted me to change and ehm you t- told me that you will ehm kind of organise it.
(PERSON2) ehm You mean - you mean from ehm - for ehm consent - for our consents?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
(PERSON2) Yes, ehm mostly we h-
so d- definitely we have e-mail adresses to all or them.
Mostly they are ehm kind of colleagues, so we have really -
ehm I think it should be -
so I should ehm be - so I should -
if you ehm take ehm - if you begin to work with that, I w- I will really  ehm
<unintelligible/>
I- ehm 
so <unintelligible/> really help you a lot in that, so adjust the people, not - not to gi- to let it to the overview.
ehm
(PERSON3) ehm Yes, but, so- something is that we have to rename the characters in each meetings.
And for that w- ehm I have to ehm - I have to r-
I require having the every name in each meetings.
So we have that?
(PERSON2) Yes, ehm I will show you.
ehm Again, so just a moment.
How we <unintelligible/> looks like.
Share screen.
Screen -
ehm Can you see my screen?
ehm For example.
Can you see my screen?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
(PERSON2) ehm So what we have ehm in manually generated minutes ehm - we have the name of attendees, for example.
(PERSON3) mmhm
(PERSON2) ehm So ehm mostly ehm so- or sometimes they are not -
mostly they are <unintelligible/> surnames.
And -
but ehm this - this is the names I use - that I used in - in the meetings,
and we can reconstruct the surnames if needed.
(PERSON3) Aha, so I can work on this right away, yes?
We have a <unintelligible/> minute.
(PERSON2) ehm Sorry?
(PERSON3) ehm I - I - can you hear my voice?
(PERSON2) ehm Yes, but I'm maybe -
yes, I can hear your voice very good.
(PERSON3) Yes, okay.
Let me repeat.
I said that we have everything that we need, so I can start right away, yes?
(PERSON2) ehm Actually yes, but we will have to excerpt the names.
ehm If you can do that automatically.
So probably ehm - so -
sh-
maybe say I-
say me if I should ehm excerpt these names and put it to this table.
So - so that for each meeting you have the names of the attendees.
(PERSON3) ehm If you have time that would be good, but I can also try automatically to do that.
(PERSON2) So I began to do that but I didn't finished it.
Actually, for example, for [PROJECT2] meetings this is the same group of people and ehm for [PROJECT3] meetings this is also the same group of people.
ehm Probably ehm I will worked it ehm little bit more and say - ehm
(PERSON3) Okay so just <unintelligible/> when finish, just tell me so I can start to work.
(PERSON2) mmhm
(PERSON3) As soon as possible.
(PERSON2) mmhm Okay.
(PERSON3) I'm waiting for your statement then.
(PERSON2) Okay, mmhm.
Yes, I actually - it was also my plan to finish it as soon as possible and to say it to you, but I didn't finished, so -
(PERSON3) Okayy, thank you.
(PERSON2) There will be problems -
so it s- seems to be the- this [PROJECT2] plenary calls are ehm very problematic and probably we will - we will have to exclude all these meetings.
ehm This 10 meetings, because there is at least 1 person and ehm probably 2 persons who are objecting from having the ehm data in the corpus, so we should take it the data -
I will so - I will also inform you about that.
(PERSON3) Okay.
<typing/>
ehm mmhm, anything else?
(PERSON3) ehm No, I guess.
(PERSON4) [PERSON2], so what is the - what is the <unintelligible/> of the plan for the <unintelligible/> data, like you and Aegon was ehm <unintelligible/> to getting?
So ehm do you think, that we should be starting ehm the manual minuting on those data?
(PERSON2) ehm We didn't speak with [PERSON5] personally yet,
so actually what I did I read the same e-mail from [PERSON5] ehm,
so ehm I ehm - I ehm -
so we with [PERSON5] should now decide ehm if ehm -
I haven't seen the data yet, so I don't know how to look at them with eyes to keep the annotators, how ehm -
I actually need to look at the data and I didn't - and I didn't see it yet.
ehm So I have nothing against giving it to annotators, so ehm -
but I should first open the data.
<typing/>
<unintelligible/>
Well actually what I can see is that ehm there are quite big textual files.
[PERSON5], are you there?
(PERSON5) Yes, I'm here.
(PERSON2) ehm When you looked at the data, didn't you see the agendas there?
Or some minutes or something like that?
Because they refer to the agenda all the time, but I can't ehm understand if there is something ehm -
if there are agendas <unintelligible/> - they are probably not, yes?
(PERSON5) I don't think there are -
minutes for sure there are not, but agendas - maybe there are some short descriptions of each meeting, like -
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) So if we give this to annotators, it means that -
(PERSON5) They will read the entire thing and they will produce the - the minutes.
(PERSON2) And produce the minutes.
And as I see - as I see this list of ehm many many many [ORGANIZATION4] - [ORGANIZATION4] ehm TXTs ehm -
(PERSON5) Yes, I already specified <unintelligible/> that there are 9000 and something exactly.
(PERSON2) Aha, and ehm how - how long are they actually in terms of, I don't know -
(PERSON5) There are different lenghts, like there are 8000 words, 9000 words, 5000 words, 30000words...
(PERSON2) So you <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON5) 80000 -
(PERSON2) 80000 words -
(PERSON5) So there are different lenghts.
Yes, 80000, 8000, 5000...
So some of them are quite usable, like the 5000 or 6000 files - word files.
(PERSON2) Maybe - we will definitely be not able to ehm annotate all of them.
Maybe if you choose ehm a small sub- ehm set of ehm shorter meetings, I <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON5) I already said this in the e-mail, [PERSON2], did you read the e-mail?
(PERSON2) ehm Yes, but maybe not very attentively.
I -
(PERSON5) Okay, so I already said that we can select the ones that are short enough, <parallel_talk/> Yes. <parallel_talk/> like 8000, 9000 words.
And the ones that <unintelligible/> dialog <parallel_talk/> Yes, the diary. <parallel_talk/> cause we don't need monologues.
(PERSON2) But I would -
(PERSON5) So I already stated this in the e-mail <unintelligible/> to - to select this - this ehm - this - this documents, that are -
(PERSON2) Yes, this is - this is what I read, but I din't understand if you are able to technically -
(PERSON5) Yes, I can - I can do it automatical, because the <unintelligible/> set pretty much very st-
like I -
properly structured and it's - it's easy to count the number of words in each file automatically.
So I can filter the - the shorter ones, the ones up to 1000, the ones up to 8000, whatever.
It's not really hard to do it.
(PERSON2) Perfect.
So then maybe ehm could I ask you to make this to <unintelligible/> ehm -
(PERSON5) Yes, I will create some - some - I can crete the words with some folders, with each file up to -
for example folder, which - with 10000, which contains all the - the files up to 10000 words.
One 5000, one 7000, and then we can decide which one you use, dependin on the lenght that - that we want.
(PERSON2) Yes, and ehm please do it only for English.
I suppose that in Cz- for Czech it is the - they are just translated.
(PERSON5) I don't know that, but yes, I can only for -
(PERSON2) They would do the same, this is the parallel corpus.
(PERSON5) I don't know, this is the source.
This is not the parallel version that <unintelligible/> for machine translation.
So, I'm not sure about -
(PERSON2) Yes, but ehm [ORGANIZATION4] is just a parallel - ca- ca-
have the idea of parallel texts, so it's - would be logical if the meeting are the same, but translated into other languages.
(PERSON5) Okay, okay.
(PERSON2) So let's do it for English.
(PERSON5) Yes, sure, of course.
(PERSON2) ehm So pleas choose, how many.
I don't know, 40?
Shorter dialogues - dialogue meetings.
(PERSON5) I will produce different versions and then we can decide <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Okay.
(PERSON5) But there is also one catch - there is also one extra thing, but somebody has to see inside and somehow remove -
so spot the ones that are only monologues.
Because there are couple of monologues there -
(PERSON2) So this is what you can't do automatically, you c-
(PERSON5) ehm No.
So somebody has to go there and - but it's - it doesn't take a lot of time I guess, because you just see 1, 2, 3 different <unintelligible/> and you see it's a - it's a dialogue.
(PERSON2) Okay.
(PERSON5) If you go down, down, down and can't see different speekers, then you can delete it, cause it's monologue.
(PERSON2) Okay.
(PERSON5) So I don't think it takes much time.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes yes yes.
It will not take much time.
ehm Perfect.
ehm Then let's try to put <unintelligible/> and see how much meetings we will get before ehm -
(PERSON5) Yes.
From 9000 and then something?
I guess we can come up with some hundreds of good propriets.
(PERSON2) Yes ehm, yes, but I mean how many meetings we can anotate before the deadline of the data -
(PERSON5) This - this depends on the annotation capacity.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON5) Number of annotators and their capacity.
(PERSON2) Yes, well, let see.
Hopefully we get something over 30. 
Okay, this is clear.
What next?
(PERSON4) [PERSON2], I - I also e-mailed about the probable ehm time lenght that we should be looking for, ehm so did you have time to go through the e-mail, maybe?
(PERSON2) Proposal submission November 2020.
Data release Januarly - January.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
So ehm this is what we do - like ehm ensure from <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Insury for what?
(PERSON4) ehm That - that is what we need to ensure for our <unintelligible/> that we -
that - what data we <unintelligible/> to release.
ehm We have to make that ready maybe by the end of this year.
(PERSON2) mmhm
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON2) I means what from my side?
(PERSON4) No, I just wanted to, like, communicate this to all ehm that this is what the time lenght we are looking for.
And suppose -
like we decide that ehm we have now currently 76 - ehm 76 instances of Enlish and 54 instances of Czech.
Suppose we are - we are thinking like - maybe we would release 500 or 300 as part for - ehm as part for data sets.
So, ehm that exact figure we need to, like, agree on and try to achieve that ehm by the end of this year.
That's what.
(PERSON2) That is what I cannot promise.
(PERSON4) mmhm
So, wh- wh- what you - what you think ehm would be ehm - would be a possible number that we could reach by December, [PERSON2]?
(PERSON2) I would say that -
Yes.
I would say that it would not be more than we have now.
Because ehm - first of all, some meetings ehm should ehm have to be deleted.
ehm Some - so something about 10 hours will definitely be dele- deleted.
(PERSON4) mmhm
(PERSON2) And probably we get 10 hours more.
But ehm I cannot definitely promise it.
So it is possible that we get more, but ehm -
Well actually - well I c- ehm -
Data you mean ehm -
<unintelligible/> -
ehm Actually, when I look at the duration -
This is the duration, so now we have 80 hours of transcribed and minuted minutes.
But if we ehm look ehm at that 28 minutes are twice, which means we have about 25 hours more.
Actually, we have now 100000.
If we consider the same minutes for -
if we consider minutes for the same meetings.
How do you count it?
How should we count it?
(PERSON4) ehm Like I can only see <unintelligible/> point of view to ehm -
like mostly I would count all the instances we have, ehm but ehm I think we need to do a bit of study on what should be the number of instances.
Like we would release the <unintelligible/> training as ehm <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) mmhm
Okay, so, I will - I will - I am writing this to - to the agenda.
So ehm you will kind of consider ehm what is the standard n-
so how much data is the minimum possible to be released for the shared task.
(PERSON4) Yes.
Yes, so what I have to do [PERSON2], is I will present ehm - I will present the ehm data statistic that we have as far of our share task this year in <unintelligible/>.
And then we can decide <unintelligible/> that.
(PERSON2) ehm You will present, sorry, what?
(PERSON4) I will present the shared task statictisc of the summarisation.
ehm Shared task that we <unintelligible/> this year.
So far that we can have an idea that should be the minimum number of data instances ww should release <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Yes, maybe also - ehm maybe also focus on dialogue data.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
ehm For the shared task we have any dialogue data -
(PERSON2) I mean - I mean - so whan you use ehm -
So speech data.
Where you u-
Speech manually transcribed data, so how m-
Because this is very different when you w- you - when you work with not speech it's much more available.
(PERSON4) Alright.
I - I - I - I - understand your concern.
So let me do a little review on this and maybe ehm <unintelligible/> and we will get back to you with -
(PERSON2) mmhm
(PERSON4) What is the statistics of the other because it's in speech -
So -
And also shared task - in general shared data.
So then we can ehm, like, decide upon that.
So it's an action point on me <unintelligible/> we do <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Yes, thank you, mmhm.
ehm I'm writing this down to the agenda, yes?
ehm I see the <unintelligible/> that <unintelligible/>, but I'm trying to ehm c- populate the agenda as much as I can.
(PERSON4) Okay.
Anythig else we want to discuss today?
(PERSON2) ehm I would like to ask [PERSON1], is she here?
[PERSON1], are you there?
(PERSON1) Yes, I'm there.
You hear me?
(PERSON2) Hi.
(PERSON1) Hi, hi, hi [PERSON2].
(PERSON2) ehm I tried to ask <unintelligible/> the evaluation, have you proceeded <unintelligible/>?
(PERSON1) mmhm ehm Yes.
So I did ehm <unintelligible/> that ehm <unintelligible/> for that, because the manual evaluation needs the alignment.
Can we ehm just get ehm a call with ehm - a call with the alignment too?
(PERSON2) Yes, this -
No, no no no no.
This is 2 different tasks.
First of all -
So the first one is resolved ehm the alignment and this is what I actuall wanted to ehm do with you now.
And the second one is using this speeches alignment, but we don't have access to here now.
ehm So let's -
(PERSON1) Okay.
(PERSON2) Let's first walk ehm with ehm the criteria the, I don't know, [PERSON5] proposed.
(PERSON1) mmhm So we have to create 2 <unintelligible/> evaluative -
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> some others <unintelligible/> understandability.
So let's just think about different ehm criteria, that we can use manually and now with the alignment.
(PERSON1) mmhm Okay.
Okay, so I have to do it now without alignment.
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON1) Okay.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> So untif- until we have - we have the result of - the alignment results -
(PERSON1) mmhm
<typing/>
(PERSON4) So I think we are running out of the [ORGANIZATION2] 40 minutes slot.
(PERSON2) Okay, mmhm.
ehm So, should we finish now?
ehm Do we have any other -
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON2) mmhm
(PERSON4) Yeah.
[PERSON7] - ehm [PERSON7] or [PERSON3], if you have something to ask or something to add?
(PERSON7) No, I'm okay.
(PERSON7) No, no, no, thanks.
(PERSON4) Okay, wonderful.
So then, like, ehm we can <unintelligible/> today and then tomorrow again?
(PERSON2) mmhm Okay.
(PERSON4) Perfect.
(PERSON2) And [PERSON3] I will - I will write you when I ehm get a little bit closer ehm to the end of this ehm participants list.
(PERSON7) Okay, but if it was hard just tell me and I can do that myself.
(PERSON2) Yes.
Yes, I will contact you.
So I will try to do most wh- what is easy and then ehm -
so what - ehm what kind of demands may understand enough the situation and what ehm technical thing I will adress you.
Thank you.
(PERSON7) yeah, okay, thank you.
(PERSON2) So, thank you.
(PERSON4) Okay, thank you.
(PERSON3) Thank you everyone.
(PERSON2) Bye bye.
(PERSON4) Thank you, bye bye.
