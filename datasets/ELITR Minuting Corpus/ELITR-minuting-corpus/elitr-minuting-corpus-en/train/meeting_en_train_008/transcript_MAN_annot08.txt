(PERSON3) Yes. 
(PERSON6) Well, he is not responding right now, 
maybe he will call back.
Yes, [PERSON3], did he?
(PERSON3) Not yet.
(PERSON6) He go through the proposal?
(PERSON3) I'm not sure.
No, because I don't see his comments.
(PERSON6) Uhm I I I'm trying to open it now.
I opened it.
Yes, I have.
I can see my comments just my comments.
Okay mhm.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
What do you need urgently to discuss [PERSON3] today?
(PERSON3) Uh I think now the things that are left is mostly too, like <unintelligible/> with [PERSON4].
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON3) Otherway uhm I need to add the references that I didn't do so that I have to do.
And there is something on the introduction part.
So that is the first one.
(PERSON6) Uhm, uhm.
(PERSON3) But before writing my introduction, I was like hoping to talk to [PERSON4] first.
(PERSON6) Yes, yes, I agree.
And I can see that there are two more teams left to find.
Yeah.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Okay, uh.
[PERSON6] can you put the name of the annotators in the acknowledgment minute.
(PERSON6) Put the name of what can?
(PERSON3) Annotators, of the annotators in acknowledgment.
(PERSON6) Of all the annotators?
(PERSON3) Yes, the those who have contributed maybe, 
or do you think we just mentioned the annotators?
(PERSON6) Uhm probably so there are 20 people.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
(PERSON6) Should I restore them?
I can.
But I'm not sure it is <unintelligible/>.
As you think I don't know.
So if, if you want, I may list.
I will say how much how many uhm just uhm well okay.
Something about 23 persons.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> only the annotators.
(PERSON6) Uhm, I think so.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON6) Uhm and [PERSON3] you have send me the summarizations yet, yes?
(PERSON3) No, no, no, no.
I I will send you.
(PERSON6) Mhm.
So I have frigh-
(PERSON3) Okay, okay.
(PERSON6)  Okay, just-
(PERSON3) So so all of the you have <unintelligible/> right?
 [PERSON6] only mi- mine is that?
(PERSON6) Yes, I have only pre- I have already prepared the folders.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON6) Which in all the minuting
And for these two meetings.
And in one folder we have maybe seven annotations or eight.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON6) The seven with have eleven.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON6) So and if so after you are send me I will-
<other_noise/>
[PERSON4] is calling,
I will take it.
(PERSON3) Okay.
Uhm.
(PERSON6) [PERSON4] <another_language/>
hallo, halo, 
are you here?
Uhm.
(PERSON2) Yes. Yeah, yeah.
<censored/>
And he will open the document and look at it and control it.
So I will now send him the links.
Where are we?
And the link to the [ORGANIZATION2].
So he will join us in I don't know ten minutes or maybe twelve, 
so we can discuss something before that, 
and then consult with him ju- so uhm  I will write him an email now.
(PERSON3) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) Ah, okay.
Whose kids are these?
(PERSON3) Hello.
(PERSON6) Hello whose kids are these?
(PERSON3) Kid?
(PERSON6) Yes. 
(PERSON3) Oh, I don't know.
Not mine.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Not yours, okay.
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) [PERSON3] it's from the background my way.
(PERSON6) Aha, aha, okay.
(PERSON3) Oh, is it?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) I can hear a lot of kids and these are not mine.
<laugh/>
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> 
(PERSON6) Oh, anyway, what should we discuss else?
I should a lot of questions.
Now, I don't know.
(PERSON3) [PERSON2] did you happen to go through the proposal one.
(PERSON2) Oh yeah, I did see it.
Oh.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So did you mention any comments somewhere?
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> maybe let [PERSON4] discuss <unintelligible/> than uhm maybe I would <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/>
two things like via meeting meeting summarization was involved.
You send me know that look for the reference in all?
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON2) So I did collected that as well.
So maybe let on <unintelligible/> then we I will.
First I think I should make you see that?
And then uhm a little too add to this.
Suppose I need to ask to you about that.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) About what?
About the references?
(PERSON2) Yes, about the references.
And there were two things which we should add to it.
So first I want to discuss with you
and then maybe.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah. 
Please go add then we can discuss now.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) Yeah, 
but I need to show you the references to that document.
So maybe I will call you after.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON2) That's allright with send it maybe let let  first [PERSON4] <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Okay, okay, okay. 
So you are.
Will call me later right?
(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON3) Okay, okay, okay.
Uhm.
(PERSON6) And [PERSON3] do you agree with how I describe what I have I had to describe?
Do you agree with my parts?
(PERSON3) The menu- yes the <unintelligible/> part is okay, [PERSON6],
But <laugh/> we have not we don't have the fine concept yet.
That's true uh,
but I think we should also mention that when we would release the data uh, all the uh participants would be the identified.
(PERSON6) But ah, well, I have actu-
(PERSON3) Okay, uhm. 
It is <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Ah I have actually mentioned that.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON6) So it he- uhm so the personal information is not present in the least data or it has been they identified.
The problem is that it is not true for the moment, 
but I suppose we don't have to say that.
Yes.
So it will.
(PERSON3) We don't <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> release, but now, it's just a lie.
(PERSON3) Mhm.
(PERSON6) Yeah, but.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) It's a lie, okay.
(PERSON6) Otherwise what else.with general questions?
(PERSON3) I'm going to borrow some text from your paper [PERSON6] yeah for the introduction.
(PERSON6) Mhm.
Aha.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Why didn't you do that?
(PERSON3) I was definitely <unintelligible/> you.
(PERSON6) Aha you shouldn't you so you definitely shouldn't say me why didn't you do them before it should it I could <unintelligible/>
should I do that.
(PERSON3) Yeah something on the introduction you have to write about uh introducing uh minuting.
(PERSON6) Ahaa.
Something bla bla bla thing about why is it important.
Yes something that.
Uhm.
I will look if I find it.
(PERSON4) Hello, hello.
Hi.
Can you hear me?
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) I'm here.
I'm the limbic corridor,
and I'll also stay in the corridor because my colleagues don't like me talking in the yeah in the office.
But I need to locate also the [ORGANIZATION2].
So I just arrived.
Yeah,
one thing.
So I'm now searching for the two more participants structure meetings.
Do I have that [ORGANIZATION2].
(PERSON6) I have sent you the link to that.
(PERSON4) Today or when?
(PERSON6) Just ten minutes ago, 
and before that it was sent by [PERSON3]
and asked probably on the Friday, 
but just opened the last email from me.
It is from ten minutes ago.
(PERSON4) Participant.
Oh yeah, okay that's for some reason like the screen is always too small, 
and-
(PERSON6) Especially in the corridor.
(PERSON4) Especially.
Okay, great uh.
(PERSON6) You are on there. 
Did you find it?
(PERSON4) Yes. 
Oh, is it indeed to be this long like is it is it expected that the shared task has this long description.
Ah, ah, it is probably okay.
Ah, but-
(PERSON3) So uh actually [PERSON4] so I have I have prepared it according to the the submissions that we did for <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON3) This <unintelligible/> last year.
Yeah, so it was roughly three pages, 
but here we have included some more description 
because they had <unintelligible/> the participants.
So-
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3)  I think it got a bit lindy, 
but we have like it it should be it would be be around four pages, 
because we have to add the introduction.
And some other <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) And the deadline is two days from now or something like that or tomorrow?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON3) So I hope within by tonight it will be like a fully willing to go.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON4) Call for papers and <unintelligible/> <parallel_talk/>
Yeah al- magical for participation, right?
And I'll actually I suggest that we because the coordination call and trial data is not too clear.
(PERSON3) Uh-huh.
(PERSON4) I will make it round it.
So can we shift the call for participation earlier?
When will they tell us whether we have succeeded or not?
(PERSON3) Uh it would be January 6th.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So I suggest that we make the call for participation already like January seven or something like that.
And trailed data at the level end of January.
So I'm modifying that these <unintelligible/> 
and so so did you want this list to be like <unintelligible/> as a table 
or no.
(PERSON3) We can do it.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) I I don't think it's important.
It just-
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON4) Yeah, okay.
So I will probably read it.
And yeah.
(PERSON3) So [PERSON4] I specifically need your input in some sections, 
which are like which are vital like why this session si special, 
like what makes this session special for to be included as a shared task in interspeech.
So this is one question that we need to answer.
And that is section three.
And there is another thing is section 4.3, 
um where uh we need to specify that uh why this is something that that could not be covered in in the speech a main conference.
Why do we we are doing a separate shared task for this.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
Uh well, it's just to be visibly distinct from the research papers.
So to say so it's-
(PERSON3) We have written like something that we agreed upon.
But maybe you can uh include something more uh.
So section three request exactly five points.
(PERSON4) Exact what they say, right?
(PERSON3) Exactly five points why this shared task is special.
(PERSON4) Yeah, do you have so where should I find the uh assignment to the say in third speech 2021 called four papers or-?
(PERSON3) Okay, let me post the link.
(PERSON4) Actually important dates calls satellite events, special sessions and challenges, right?
(PERSON3) Yeah, right.
Yeah.
(PERSON4) Title of the proposed session names in  <parallel_talk/>
Up to five bullet points on what makes yeah so up to.
I don't not exactly up to.
(PERSON3) Yeah, oh, okay.
(PERSON4) <parallel_talk/> up to one page.
I think we I think the document is really too long.
(PERSON3) Uhm, uhm I think the proposal summary we have skipped to one page like in the second page.
Uh do you want to <unintelligible/> what?
(PERSON4) <parallel_talk/> something other than oh yeah <parallel_talk/>
And the submission deadline for the regular interspeech paper submission.
That's May fifteen, right?
Is that correct?
Yeah?
Because we have to copy-
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON4) We have to copy their structure.
(PERSON3) The paper submissioned deadline is March 26th for interspeech.
Yeah, but we have to like the papers for approved special sessions have to be submitted following the same schedule and procedure as regular papers.
The papers will undergo the same review process by anonymous and independent review.
Special session organizers will be involved in the reviewer assignment and the <unintelligible/> decisions.
So there really has to be uhm the standard timing for the papers.
(PERSON3) All then ah then it is very tough, right?
(PERSON4) Yes, it will be tight the deadline will be very tight, 
but I don't think that's killing anything.
I don't think it is too big a a problem.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So we want that we we have the paper submissions do you want March 26th itself?
(PERSON4) <parallel_talk/>
What do you mean by announcements?
Just a quick question.
That is like the the results, right?
(PERSON3) Lika after yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON4) And system submission.
Ejeje so that is to mhm.
So what is the for [ORGANIZATION1] the the sessions uhm the workshop for [ORGANIZATION1] that has already been 
ah, ah, ah, like the deadline for those has passed, or not yet?
But we are-
(PERSON3) For proposal proposal submission <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Yeah, it is past.
(PERSON4) Yeah, ah so the uhm it's very mm.
Yeah, we should, we should check.
What is I I will probably call ss one of the organizers of interspeech, 
because he is familiar with the interspeech.
So I'll amused myself.
I try to regime just now.
And uhm maybe he will respond.
We will see.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) [PERSON3]?
(PERSON3) Yes [PERSON6].
(PERSON6) I'm looking at these bullet points while this session is special, 
I actually don't understand the formulations.
I I don't think we can leave it.
So, because it's actually not the answer to question where is it special.
So audi- stating the automatic minuting for a low  resource language like Czech actually Czech is not  so low resources, first of all.
And then it's not a big uhm an answer to the question why its it is special.
So I think we should refo- reformulate bullet points.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
(PERSON6) Are you it kind of don't understand it attempting three task on minuting evaluation, as described in section four point two.
It's not clear at all.
I don't know even what do you mean.
We should really 4.2.
(PERSON3) Okay, 
so I'm referring to the tasks that we are proposing as part of the shared task.
Oh, okay, it it should be 4.4.
(PERSON6) Ah, ah yes, then it's a little bit more understandable.
But [PERSON4] I would just I would really may.
I think they should made these bullet points very very declarative and clear.
So why?
Because this is the first <unintelligible/> shared task,
because they are no- not enough of data yet.
I don't know.
So just to say something, 
something like,
because something is something.
This formulation that the reviewer can understand it from the formulation.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) So automatic minuting for language other than English.
(PERSON6) That is not the answer to the question why this special way this session is special.
So why what is what is special?
So what is the so special and not made for General Conference.
Why the fact that we make other languages that Eng- than English, 
why we should organize the special safe session.
So there are a lot of languages analyzed within the main conference not only English.
So the main conference is not a specializing in English.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
So this question is different from why do we want the interspecial session?
So there we have to make the distinct uh wishing between a main conference and special session.
But yes, probably you are right.
We have to highlight that this is the first documenting minuting uh for language other than English.
(PERSON6) I didn't get it.
But uhm I just think that you are an easy English human readable.
So why,
because because something.
Oh.
(PERSON3) Okay.
So actually, it's a kind of cop this information what you have in section 4.3, 
probably in emerged together, 
probably delete this 4.3.
And the information that we have in 4.3 put in si- put to this why this session is special.
So it's actually twice answered the same question.
(PERSON3) Okay but if you can uh see in the call for proposals [PERSON6].
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON3) They also mentioned like about the five bullet points.
And also the summary should also explain why the topic cannot be properly con- covered by <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Ehm, so this is not the summary.
So summary is just some part of the document, yes.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON6) So that overleaf is not what you will uh have what you will use as a single document, 
you will split it into details.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON6) Mhm.
(PERSON3) So whatever points they have mentioned in the <unintelligible/> proposal I tried to cover them.
But maybe we can do some uh real incidents.
(PERSON6) Oh, well anyway, if even if you want to put it in the one one side a one page summary,
I still think that they answer why this why this section is special.
The answer is included to 4.3
and not into this section three at the first page.
So actually, a section three at the first page doesn't answer even a little to the question the the question why this session is special.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON6) But we will already have the answer.
So it's not the problem just to formulate it.
So that.
(PERSON3) Mhm.
(PERSON4) So I've texted the <unintelligible/> organizer for interstates this year, 
because he has obviously many years of experience with internal speech in general, 
and he is busy at the moment in a meeting, 
but hopefully he'll respond to me shortly.
I have described to him the ah our situation.
And I think that ah there are uhm  explicit roads two problems or risks that ah that I see there 
and ah one risk is that actually no speech is involved in our ah task setting um 
and ah that is ah because we have text to text ah data only 
and we don't have consenc for more,
we cannot give voice at the moment but we could do that in the future.
So I think it has to be very carefully worded ah that it's text text now,
but if ah the community is able to ah to get ah sound recordings for the approvals, 
then ah it is it makes more senece to run this task from speech already,
but no- not for this year,
so that this is one thing that we should make clear
and the other problem that I mentioned is the timing,
so really need to have the regular paper submission  deadline on March 26th, 
and in that uhm I would really seek for papers that are related to uhm specificly meetings summarizations.
So like the the speech aspect uhm I <unintelligible/> the summarization aspect or the speech aspect of uhm what we are doing.
So any basic research, any any relevant papers uhm for this partical use it of speech systems would go there
so we would have like a s- special review  procedure 
and I'm asking the organizer if it is okay fot us to have secondary paper deadline for the system paper which would be the one that you suggested in the uhm the May 15th.
Yeah?
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON4) So as-
(PERSON3) Actually [PERSON4] <unintelligible/> I don't <unintelligible/> but I think for Asian we can <unintelligible/> like <unintelligible/> three two tool <unintelligible/> deadlines.
But eventually we have to submit to <unintelligible/>  same camera ready deadline that we have to <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yeah,
so but but we have not applied for Asia workshops, have we?
(PERSON3) Yeah.
Yes, yes.
No, no, no.
(PERSON4) Yes, so, yeah, exactly.
So the [ORGANIZATION1] rules are not relevant for us.
So, so if we don't get into in their speech  then the question is what we should do.
And we obviously can try to join some existing workshop which will make it for [ORGANIZATION1],
but I don't know which one.
And it's it's kind of like going around the rules.
So it that's a pity that we haven't thought of this like early enough,
but I think the deadline was probably in September already, right?
(PERSON3) Yes.
It was, it was too early.
Yeah.
(PERSON4) Yeah, it was too early for-
(PERSON3) But we have but we have other <unintelligible/> so if it doesn't really goes to interspeech we have other <unintelligible/> like six <unintelligible/> I have.
(PERSON4) Yes, okay. 
That's good.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so-
(PERSON3) So that is for <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Uhm so I'll yeah  I think we, we need to carefully review this, 
but I think the document is really too short, so they want to read less.
Ah, so that is.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) Ah, that is important.
So like I would avoid the abstract.
I would put the organizer details on this very last face of the structure, eh.
The structure should copy what they are asking for, right?
So the if you just open this special session and challenges.
They have this six points.
They want to know the title of the proposed special session, 
which is not too clear from our title <laugh/> <unintelligible/>  affiliations of the organizers including brief.
Okay, so yes, the name's information.
That that good.
After five bullet points a summary eh stating the importance of this session should also
<parallel_talk/>
Okay.
So maybe, maybe this, maybe actually you have the correct structure.
Just the title is not lo- not so like shining from that.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) Uh maybe, maybe a proposal is just right, 
maybe just like it took me a while until I matched it in my heads in my head.
So aa it's should be.
Ah, yeah.
Obviously it is not anonymous, right?
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yes.
(PERSON4) <parallel_talk/>
Okay.
I think it should show the names, right?
Should [PERSON1] be part of this or not?
(PERSON3) Um, uh like uh, we are not sure on this.
So what about you. 
<laugh/>
(PERSON4) Uhm well we should probably ask him because he is he is now finishing, 
so he won't be really available at the moment.
Uh I'll email him whether he sh- would like to be part of that, 
because he obviously has worked on that somewhat even if it was destruction.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yes, sure.
So I actually <unintelligible/> asked for all the details from uhm in the minuting group, 
so he didn't respond?
So maybe you can ans- onec again,
(PERSON4) Yes, yeah, okay, yeah, exactly.
I'll put just you and [PERSON6] there.
So that we don't have to spam everybody uh.
<parallel_talk/>.
(PERSON3) So, ah, so one thing, ah, I would like to mention on this like.
Do you want me to condense the proposal to maybe two pages.
(PERSON4) Yes, probably it would be a good idea.
So I think that they, 
I don't like the biographies at the beginning, but that's what they ask for.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, I agree.
So uh the thing is [PERSON4] like uh, then uh like certain things that have added are not maybe require.
For example they are not interested in the proposed timeline or submission platform, other relevant information.
What would be the evaluation metrics and things.
So uh so uh I don't know like.
(PERSON4) So it's okay to have them there at the very end.
(PERSON3) Oh, okay.
(PERSON4) So I would put it like after the non standard resources, probably or as a difficult <parallel_talk/>
Data collection session for a proposal summary.
But your your organization makes sense.
So like it's <parallel_talk/>.
Okay, I will try one more phone call on this.
So I'll I'll have to move to Monday seminar because I I to see how to systems are  <unintelligible/> 
but I had I called [PERSON5] <unintelligible/> his the second chair of all the special sessions.
So do you follow me, 
are you here?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON4) Yeah. 
Yeah.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) And uhm he said that well first uh we we should have read this carefully this I I that that that he didn't say this but but we we should  have realised how how that works.
So this special sessions must not allow for a cheap way to get into interspeech.
So uhm in short we cannot have system paper susbmission later.
We have to have paper submisson dedline on March 26th.
So we should recall it challenge and not call it shared task.
We should call it challenge.
We should seek for papers that contribute in many possible ways.
And we can obviously keep our schedule for the shared task itself 
and with the <unintelligible/> ready people are welcome to uhm update their papers and put the put the summary how they how they proceed it into uhm like in in the special session. 
So that's that's good.
But uhm it's the timing is different and uhm and also uhm in the past there were challenges in interspeech but everybody had it early enough so that they succeed it in in they <unintelligible/> they hit the standard paper submission deadline. 
So in in the sence we're late and that for for that reason we require the participants to to first write the paper and only then submit the the system.
But uhm I think that something that we can live with.
So please modify the the timeline so that the paper submission in the <unintelligible/> the system submission by far.
(PERSON3) Aha.
(PERSON4) And the papers will be judge independently of how they run in the in the competition itself.
 And we ourselves need to submit probably that's my guess uhm like our summary paper for this.
So that needs describe the data set and all and all that. 
And in to that paper we will then feed in the results.
So there has to be the <unintelligible/> submission they want they they they clearly want to keep the the strict the strict <unintelligible/> 
And I think we can <unintelligible/> that.
(PERSON3) So so the <unintelligible/> will be chosen by interspeech or we we would choose?
Our reviewes?
(PERSON4) Uhm I think that specified in the here proposal if the evaluated by the organizing commity <unintelligible/> papers for approach have to be submit follow in the same schedule <unintelligible/> proceeder. 
Papers will <unintelligible/> the same review proces by anonymous and independent reviewers.
Special session organizes will be invovelved in the reviewer assignment and in the final decisions.
(PERSON3) Uhm.
(PERSON4) It's on the webpage.
So it's it's there clearly.
So uhm I <unintelligible/> these now. 
(PERSON3) Okay. 
(PERSON4) But please modified so that we are matching the the deadline that's <unintelligible/> speech wants.
I thinks it's <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON3) Okay, so the so only the papers submission deadline but <unintelligible/> submisson deadline would be later.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON4) And and we needed wo- we need to word it so that we seek papers even on just the topic 
and not taking part in the shared task.
(PERSON3) Uhm, okay.
(PERSON4) So we have-
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> summarization.
(PERSON4) like so what we have now is a list of people who agreed to do this shared task thing,
but what we don't have is a list of people who can submit a a real full paper on that.
So that something that we have to keep in mind.
(PERSON3) Oh. 
Yes.
And.
(PERSON4) Well. Yeah.
(PERSON3) We have still <unintelligible/> by tool because like <unintelligible/> tommorrow.
(PERSON4) Yeah, I know, I know. 
I need.
But I have no idea at the moment. 
I'll I'll try to <unintelligible/> thing.
Yeah.
Okay.
So well, 
Will be in touch.
(PERSON3) And, and.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) And final <unintelligible/> like like do do you think we need to <unintelligible/> to two page or you think <unintelligible/> it is okay?
