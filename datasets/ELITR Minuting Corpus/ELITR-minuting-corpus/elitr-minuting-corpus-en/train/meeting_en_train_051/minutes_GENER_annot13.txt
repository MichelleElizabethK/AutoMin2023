Manual Evaluation of IW SLT Primary Submissions - Microsoft has offered to perform manual evaluation of primary submissions in IW SLT and potentially of the human outputs as well. This is in addition to the automatic evaluation which is part of the paper. The Intermediate ASR is not part of the evaluation and therefore segmentation is important.
Continuous Speak Diarisation –  to be made into tool that is to be used for minuting. Currently it enables to recognise male and female speakers and is able to split them, functionality also allows to show annotation of the sound. However, further adaptation is required as the system is currently working offline only.
