(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
<other_noise/>
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> from someone.
Now its better.
Maybe you have too sensitive mic [PERSON5].
<other_noise/>
(PERSON2) I'm sorry for being late.
And uh, yeah, lets, lets get started, because uh remember we will, kick, kick out of the meeting in 30 minutes or so.
So, what are the news?
I know everything from uh, [PERSON5].
Well, actually, actually not everything.
But I'm curious about the place <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/>
So [PERSON3] has a presentation right?
[PERSON3] can you see it?
(PERSON5) Yes, [PERSON3] <unintelligible/> presentation?
(PERSON3) Yes and we didnt include the video.
(PERSON2) Yeah, because we do not have any.
There was nothing to uh, to include and the moment.
The one, which would be most for one would be the <unintelligible/> video.
(PERSON3) Sir, there is a  90 seconds space, what do we do?
(PERSON2) 90 seconds, that is good.
90 is quite a lot.
And can you edit it somehow?.
(PERSON3) Yes, we can.
We can append to the end, and and they will, they will, they will paste it together for <unintelligible/> need to paste the videos.
(PERSON2) Okay.
Thats is good.
So can can I see the the presentation, the recording is it available anywhere or, or not?
(PERSON3) Yes, I can send your the link and confine it among the uploaded videos.
(PERSON2) So that there are other presentations, also available right for by other teams?
(PERSON3) No only by me.
And i worry that you need to play the two videos separately, because there is one video of me talking, and the other is the recorded screen.
(PERSON2) I see.
(PERSON3) And they are in webm format, if you download them.
(PERSON2) So hopefully will play for me, i think, I have seen some webm, webm files,so thats very good.
Ok.
So uh.
So you know, there is there is a rage.
<parallel_talk/>
They not <unintelligible/> results of flicker.
<laugh/>
[PERSON5] <laugh/> youre again, <unintelligible/>.
<laugh/>
Or maybe its not [PERSON5], maybe someone else's is look at me.
(PERSON3) Its me, because my laptop is stuck in this moment.
I borrowed <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Okay, yeah thats good.
Yeah.
Thank you.
So I will have a look at the presentation.
The deadline is tomorrow, right?
Tomorrow anywhere on Earth, or are those any, any specification of the time zone?
(PERSON3) No. Maybe tomorrow, tomorrow, AOAA, AOI.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
So I'm now looking at the evaluation, the this link, the <unintelligible/> scores and im still curious like confused, its video name.
So maybour so <unintelligible/> is the one that we were subtitling.
And how do we know-
Okay so we do know the reference for the English maybour.
Okay.
So this is, this is what we can present.
But then I'm really surprised to see the <unintelligible/> is like points to into one and two point 19 and thirteen, or fourteen into, into German.
Why is it- Is it correct?
It is in this, this big, uh, like it is the check that bad, or is it an issue with the segmentatio?
In general, the checks course, look look strange.
<other_noise/> <unintelligible/> also very very bad like.
(PERSON3) Yeah, <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) Yeah so-
(PERSON5) I would like to point here <unintelligible/> ASR <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Yes, exactly this only translation, and also need the world error rates.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
<unintelligible/>
So here is the the demo.
I'm opening the demo document now, and I'm searching for that Mabel, Mabel-
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> the demo document in the <unintelligible/> in the <unintelligible/> scrolled <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Okay, okay.
Yup, yeah, okay.
So the <unintelligible/> rate for English ASR, shefers is terrible order rate.
Ok.
That would explain why the <unintelligible/> are so bad, the <unintelligible/> are not so bad.
And uh, so this is, uh, this is what we can report uh, for the <unintelligible/> check.
And this is what we can report for the marble English speech, and actually which of the systems have we used for the demo as well- <unintelligible/>
<parallel_talk/>
(PERSON5) I don't know wha that domain <unintelligible/> has <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) Yeah. So <unintelligible/> <other_noise/>
And so there we would need to look at the the file.
So please, uh, uh, uh, <parallel_talk/> [PERSON5], please provide <unintelligible/> to the ASR outputs as well, as the references.
And same for the bless course here.
So in the [ORGANIZATION1] sheets <unintelligible/> and I'm adding two lines among, and would like to know the <unintelligible/> base directory.
<other_noise/>
So if you could paste here.
<unintelligible/>
<unintelligible/> but I do not know, where the source is.
And then <unintelligible/>
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> lots of noise, if.
<unintelligible/>
[PERSON3] are you using headphones or not.
(PERSON3) Yes, you can see.
(PERSON2) It is strange that is that its making so much noise.
(PERSON5) Yes its quite, quite <laugh/>
So I can paste <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> the translation into czech was like- I would not say that this was so, it was so bad that it would deserve, it would deserve such a low score.
And also <unintelligible/> in the German.
<unintelligible/>
German one were used for the translation for the demo itself.
(PERSON5) Come again sorry, i didnt hear.
(PERSON2) Which- So we have now, for example for the German <unintelligible/> two versions, which one was used.
It was <unintelligible/> system like this one.
(PERSON5) So for today, we are used <unintelligible/> ASR system <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) And the empty is the same in all cases right?
(PERSON5) Yeah theyre <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) Okay , yeah, yeah, yeah.
And this missing cell, this cell C5.
Uh, is it also the <unintelligible/> ASR, and then empty output so should it be the same as, as C7?
(PERSON5) Yes <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON2) I'll have a look at the and and the files and for the czech, this one was also used.
So here in vaguely seems that <unintelligible/> system work worse, but I do not trust these numbers.
So we we should double check.
(PERSON5) Actually I should double check <unintelligible/> the domain adaptation, maybe that could be the reason <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) Yes, but youre talking about ASR scores, and not the bless scores <unintelligible/> in in this bullshit. You are talking about the the world error rates in the table from last surgical from the 90.
(PERSON5) Yeah yeah so basically I used the sync <unintelligible/> to get to get distance script.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) OK still, I Do not think that there is so far any like a new information that so the the general, this is what was used for the demo right?
<parallel_talk/>
So we can safely use these numbers in the presentation.
And for the czech <unintelligible/> we used the general one.
And not the adapted one.
Right?
(PERSON5) Yes we used he general one.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> this morning- <unintelligible/>
No.
I'm talking about the czech the czech ASR because we also <unintelligible/> further.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) And so that was the the the general oneone.
So there could be some little-
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) Ok.
So that is for this.
And that there is only numbers, which should make it into the demo presentation.
And there is no change in the plans like choice of a different video does not really goes like coming to a question at all.
I think this is.
This is perfect.
So that is the the minor than things like fixing the the the <unintelligible/>.
I did not know what the you go to it or <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) And what is important is that you run a test the with the video and the video acually finishes-
