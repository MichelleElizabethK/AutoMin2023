and with the data being complete, the training of the systems can begin.
--It will be trained on 8 GPU's in the firewall.
--Hopefully, the results will be in 5-7 days, so if something comes up
there is some time for carrying out other experiments.
--Cluster is quite free at the moment.
--The concentration is now set on the data augmentation because of the [ORGANIZATION4] deadline.
--Participants in the call were informed, that the two people working on the data augmentation
will consult each other and if there are good results, they will write the paper together.
--Also the meeting creator is informing about the possibility of forwarding email from [PERSON14]
about data sets they use for their multilingual experiments, although it is not certain,
if the data is [PROJECT2] and thus maybe not sufficient for the task.
--With this also informing about probable collaboration with them.

-Update on [PROJECT1].
--The number of users/collected logs has improved to 6.
--Discussing that someone from [ORGANIZATION3] is leaving
and it's not certain who's going to take over from their side.
--The minimum of users to get the needed data is about 50.

-[PROJECT2]s.
--The training of the tutorial was finished and the results can be checked.
--It was decided to do it in FrSeC.
--As of today, the script for the training of the English-Czech model is being prepared.
--After there are results for the model, experiments with constraint decoder can begin.
--Continuing to follow the instructions for the project.
--Baseline model will follow afterwards.
--It needs to be checked which version of FrSeC is the one with constrained data.
--The constrained coding in FrSeC was checked superficially, and it should be simple.

-Update on the [ORGANIZATION1].
--It was checked today and it should also start receiving today.
--Email will be sent to arrange a date.
--It will have to be checked how they will deal with the situation, that will be prepared

--He will send the correct one to [PERSON9] and hopefully, it will be resolved soon.

-Nalejvárna
--It's an introduction on how to work at  [ORGANIZATION2].
--It seems it will be on Wednesday at 2 pm Central European Time.
--It would be great if ([PERSON7] and [PERSON12]) joined in.

ask others for some small details.
-- It would be great if he joined and half paid attention.
