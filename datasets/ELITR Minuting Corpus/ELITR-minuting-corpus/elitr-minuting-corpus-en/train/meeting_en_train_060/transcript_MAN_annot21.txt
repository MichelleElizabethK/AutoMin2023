(PERSON4) Yeah, I can hear you.
(PERSON11) Okay.
Ah, does anyone know if [PERSON5] is joining us today, or?
(PERSON4) I have no idea.
(PERSON11)  Okay, so we'll see. Uh, so anyway let's start.
Uh, what's the progress for the [PROJECT4], or is there any?
(PERSON4) Uh, yes, like translation is still going,
but it's only three or four parts, or, or maybe up to ten parts remaining.
So, definitely tomorrow it will be like a whole bunch of a, or,
or like a  whole Monolingual data will be translated tomorrow, so I can join it and start straining the systems.
And, uh yeah.
So I will train it on 8 GPU's in firewall just to like, hopefully, to have the results in five,
five to seven days. 
Still to have some time like one week ors, or more for, for other experiments,
or like whatever appears, or like comes up.
(PERSON11) Okay, uh I don't know what's the situation but I think uh, the cluster's quite
free right now, so it should be -
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON4) I think so.
(PERSON11) Yeah, yeah, good, uh.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON4) I still have to wait for those like ten pieces to, to be finished just to have all the data.
(PERSON11) Mm, uh uh, okay so, uh okay so, so that's probably it for the [PROJECT5] right? 
Or the [PROJECT4] <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON11) Okay, so the next thing is [PROJECT3].
<laugh/>
Do you have any update?
(PERSON4) No updates, or you have? Okay.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Uh, yeah. Uh, the number of users, uh, it improves to six users right now, we finished it.
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON3) So, I guess if we let- wait long enough, then we will have the data we need.
(PERSON11) Uh, I think that was the, uh the em- email conversation with [PERSON6] 
and that he was trying to push the people from [ORGANIZATION3] but I'm not sure whether it was -
(PERSON3) Well, the thing is that [PERSON1] is leaving, so - 
(PERSON11) Um-hum, ye- yeah.
(PERSON3) I'm not really sure who is going to take over from their side.
(PERSON11) Um-hum. Okay, but that seems like something is at least happening, so, so great. 
Uh, so about the <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON4) Yeah, like the, like the email from, from uh, um [PERSON6],
was that he's also pissed of [PERSON1] and uh like -
(PERSON11) Um-hum
(PERSON4) <laugh/>
I had that impression from the email that uh, sorry guys I cannot help you, 
I cannot even help myself with [PERSON1] so, like. 
(PERSON11) Um-hum. Well uh, we'll see I guess like,
uh if we don't have any other or any plan B that's there's nothing much we can do.
Uh, but how man-, how many uh, participants or uh, logs do we have collected, 
uh, like six? You were saying, or uh how many, how many people?
(PERSON3) Yeah, si-, six people.
(PERSON11) And we would, we would, what's the, what's the minimum we would like to have to,
to have some - 
(PERSON3) <other_noise/>
[PERSON16]?
(PERSON4) Tens -
(PERSON3) I, I mean i-, i-
(PERSON4) Or -
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah tens because you will need  -
(PERSON11) Okay-
(PERSON3) To have, an order of more than what we did at our faculty.
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) And we had ten, so.
(PERSON4) Like fifty users, or yeah, I don't know ho- how many, 
but yeah like fifty users would be okay.
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
Uh, okay so yeah, so if that's -
Is there anything else for [PROJECT3]? Probably not right?
(PERSON4) No.
(PERSON11) So that's, that's great, that was fast.
Maybe last thing, uh what's, what's the progress with [PROJECT2]s, [PERSON12]?
(PERSON10) <other_noise/>
Hey guys, so uh -
(PERSON4) Hi.
I finished training the, the tutorial part of the, of -
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON10) FrSeC, so we decided to Fr- FrSeC,
and then today we start training the, the English, no, uh -
(PERSON2) Yeah -
(PERSON10) English-Czech model, so I'm, I'm preparing the, the script for that, 
and I'm following the instructions from that paper you sent me [PERSON11].
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON10) Um, hopefully, you will start bringing today.
So and we'll have this, this result as soon as possible for us to make the experiments
with the constrained decoder.
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
So yeah, one question uh y-, you train the model from the tutorial, 
or did you already train it with the chained data?
(PERSON10) No, uh first try I did the tutorial - 
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON10) Part, so.
(PERSON11) Okay.
(PERSON10) Now I have the, the results if you want to - uh, you, you like to check right?
That -
(PERSON11) Yeah, okay -
(PERSON10) The results were the same, we can do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, okay, you can, you can send me message on, on Slack, 
and yeah I can, I can look at it and that would be good -
(PERSON10) <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON11) And after that you can, you can start training baseline, and uh,
yeah, I need to check which version of FrSeC, has the constrained - well, 
[PERSON8] will sending emails so, we know which version was it but uh, 
I still haven't checked how, how are constrained coding works exactly in FrSeC so, there's that - 
(PERSON10) Yeah, I check it superficially, but I think that it's simple.
We, we just have to make sure to use it correctly, but -
(PERSON11) Okay.
(PERSON10) I think it's okay. 
(PERSON11) Um-hum, so, um yeah, so that seems that you, you are still quite busy.
That's good, um I don't, [PERSON16] do you have any, any suggestion, what else can be done?
Right now, probably.
(PERSON4) Uh-hum no, I haven't thought about it.
(PERSON11) Um-hum, okay what I, what I think it's good like you still need the baseline model to have something to,
to try the constraints with right?
And that will take s-, s- some time and yeah.
Uh, okay I guess like I'm not sure whether there's any technical stuff, okay.
Like since we went through this, we kept quite fast.
So uh yeah, one question,do you know, do you know [PERSON12] the up-, up-, 
do you have an up- update for the [ORGANIZATION1]? Do you know like if, if it's open, probably not right?
(PERSON10) Uh, perfect um, I check it today and i- it's, it will start today actually -
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON10) To receive um, um, um now, I can send an email to them and try to arrange a date to -
(PERSON11) Oh, that's great, okay. That sound-
(PERSON10) But I'll, I will have to check exactly, um, how they would do that, because u- uh, um,
I'm not sure how they uh, how they would deal with the, with the situation.
I'm really far away from the embassy. So, um I will -
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON10) I will prepare it and as soon as I have an, uh an answer from them uh, I let you know.
(PERSON11) Um-hum, okay that's, that's, that's great. 
Uh and another thing, well since [PERSON7] is here, I'm not sure [PERSON7]- but when,
when, when are you officially starting to work with us, or?
(PERSON2) Uh, I would say first of October.
I think there's would you ever- 
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON2) make up one uh -
(PERSON11) Okay, so -
(PERSON2) So -
(PERSON11) So, so we donť need to uh <unintelligible/>- 
(PERSON2) Yeah I think I -
(PERSON11) <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON2) So, yeah my plan is to come to the [LOCATION1] -
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON2) first of October and - 
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON2) But uh -
(PERSON11) Um-hum, okay -
(PERSON2) Yeah.
<laugh/>
(PERSON11) So that's, that's fine.
Uh, and maybe, maybe last thing [PERSON12], did you receive your payment for last month?
Hopefully there was no -
(PERSON10) No, there was a tragedy for my, my bank -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON10) Actually, I didn't receive anything, because they, they gave me the wrong IBAN which -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON10) identify my, identifies my, my account -
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON10) And they, they give me the, the wrong one, I don't know why and -
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON10) Uh, I didn't receive it yet.  
So they, now I, I, I've got the, the correct one and sent to, to [PERSON9], and they and -
(PERSON11) Okay - 
(PERSON10) I hope to receive someday, I don't know when.
(PERSON11) Okay, I also - 
(PERSON10) <laugh/>
(PERSON11) Hope that, that uh, this will get results but,
it seems that there was no, no problem from on, on our side hopefully, right? 
Like the the - 
(PERSON10) No, no your, your side is -
(PERSON11) Okay, that's -
(PERSON10) Correct -
(PERSON11) That's great <unintelligible/> -
(PERSON10) It was my bad
<other_noise/>
there to really to, to re-, to re- uh
<laugh/>
I'm really bad right - 
(PERSON11) Um -
(PERSON10) At trying to manage these things, okay.
(PERSON11) Um-hum, uh yeah. 
So I guess, I guess that's it, like I can, like if, if there's anything uh,
more detailed that anyone needs to discuss.
I can,  we can, we can uh, move it to, to some personal, uh call or meeting.
Like, I think this is good for now. 
Yeah, or uh just, just to be sure, like there's no, uh, uh like issues with the [PROJECT4], right [PERSON16]? 
Like you're not bec- being stuck on anything right?
(PERSON4) Uh, not yet -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON4) I'm just translating now and yeah l- like -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON4) Start training tomorrow and -
(PERSON11) Um-hum, okay.
(PERSON4) Yeah, I should also start doing things on the real [PROJECT4], 
because this is the, the, just the data augmentation and I'm -
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) concentrating on it just because of the [ORGANIZATION4] uh, deadline.
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) And yeah, so it's the join work with [PERSON15] and -
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) [PERSON15] is moving tomorrow to [ORGANIZATION3], and but m- most of the work,
of the training it's up to me, and yeah I hopefully just, we we just agreed to consult things,
and then hopefully he will help me with writing the paper if there are some like -
(PERSON11) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) Good results or like publishable results.
(PERSON11) Okay, uh so, I'm not sure, 
Yeah, I can, I can also forward you the email from [PERSON14].
Uh, I was asking him about his data sets, they use for their multi-, uh, or multilingual experiments.
So if you, if you have time, or if you want, you can check, check whether it can be used for,
for your experiments, but I am not completely sure whether the data is [PROJECT4],
so it might not be uh, like uh sufficient, like for, for the task, 
but you know, just so you know that we are - 
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON11) trying to -
(PERSON4) Um-hum,
(PERSON11) col- collaborate with them.
Okay, so other than that, uh okay one last thing,
if I notice correctly with the conversation with [PERSON13], uh. 
I think [PERSON12] you also were also receiving the emails about the Nalejvárna,
which, which is basically just some, some introduction to, how to work at [ORGANIZATION2], right? 
(PERSON10) Yes, yes, um.
(PERSON11) Okay, so, I think yeah, it seems it will be on Wednesday uh, at 2 pm, right?
Uh, Central European Time, uh I guess if you're not too busy it would still be helpful
if you also join [PERSON12] and uh, technically if, if [PERSON7] i- is free at that time,
it would definitely be helpful if he also joined because you will receive uh,
some well basically, uh, uh [PERSON7], [PERSON7] knows what nalejvárna means in Czech an-,
and i- idea is that uh it's a it's -
(PERSON10) Sure, I can imagine.
(PERSON11) Yeah, it's, it's a crash course or tutorial on, on -
(PERSON10) Yeah-yeah - 
(PERSON11) How to use stuff in, in at <unintelligible/> place mainly, mainly the cluster and, and other things.
So.
<other_noise/> 
In case of [PERSON12], I don't think it's completely necessary because you know the most of the stuff and you know if,
if there's any uh, troubles or issues you can, you cas as- ask us -
(PERSON10) Alright -
(PERSON11) Directly, for for some small details but a- again,
like I think it will not hurt if you at least join in and pay half attention to the, to the uh -
(PERSON10) Sure -
(PERSON11) Lecture -
(PERSON10) Yeah, it would be -
(PERSON11) Okay -
(PERSON10) It would be coo-, it would be nice to have join them.
(PERSON11) So, okay uh I will s- send you, uh send um [PERSON7] uh the -
(PERSON10) Okay -
(PERSON11) The mail
(PERSON10) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON11) Conversation so you are updated -
(PERSON2) Sure.
(PERSON11) And, yeah and just join if you can like that's the th-
(PERSON2) Okay-
(PERSON11) <unintelligible/>
Uh, okay I think if there's nothing else to discuss, we can just uh,
end it here for today and uh see you next m-, next week? 
(PERSON10) Great, see ya.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON3) Okay.
(PERSON11) Okay.
(PERSON4) See you - 
(PERSON10) See you soon -
(PERSON4) Bye-
(PERSON11) Um-hum -
(PERSON2) Bye.
(PERSON11) Bye, bye. 
(PERSON4) Bye.
(PERSON10) Bye, bye.
