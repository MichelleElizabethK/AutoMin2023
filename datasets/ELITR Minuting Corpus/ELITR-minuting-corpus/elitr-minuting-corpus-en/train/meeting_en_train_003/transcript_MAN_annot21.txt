(PERSON1) Thank you.
(PERSON4) Um-hum. 
(PERSON1) Hi all, everybody.
(PERSON4) Hello.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON1) I -
(PERSON4) Yeah, so okay so.
Ah, today we'll be discussing, the guidelines for using the interface.
(PERSON6) Uh, [PERSON4] actually yesterday, we did not uh,
upload any meeting in transcript, into it right?
(PERSON4) No. w- what -
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON4) You have in there?
(PERSON6) So I -
<laugh/>
So I -
(PERSON4) <laugh/>
(PERSON6) Was just opening that, so if you see this -
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) I have this into uh, I think uh, I have uh, this, the data,
uh, there are lots of minuting data, but it is not selecting any text file.
Uh, uh so, it selects text files right?
It is-, the transcripts-
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) and minutes. 
So-
(PERSON4) Yeah. 
(PERSON6) If, if I just show you in my system, you can see my screen right?
(PERSON4) Um-hum, yeah-yeah.
(PERSON6) If you can see here, there are uh, there are -
if you see, even the dry run minutes, which is they -
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) There are two meetings here.
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) But it is not to say selecting the text files into that interface, annotation interface.
So, if I just select -
(PERSON4) Oh - 
(PERSON6) from the annotation interface, any, so like file, if i go to file and if i select,
like even if I do new, and any there is no text file. 
There are text files here.
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON6) There are 2 generated minutes-
(PERSON4) Okay - 
(PERSON6) and there are 2, but it is not selecting the text files. 
(PERSON4) But, but uh, so the text files are not shown right?
(PERSON6) But yeah, but if I select, ok, if i select maybe the entire folder, uh.
So, I have to select only the folder or the files.
[PERSON1], you might be, you have used this interface right?
(PERSON1) Uh, well, I have just seen it shortly.
(PERSON4) No, no you have to select only the um, like the files.
(PERSON6) File is not appearing here, can you see that?
The te-
(PERSON4) Um-hum -
(PERSON6) TXT file is not appearing, it is not -
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) You see that the TXT file, it's not selecting the TXT file.
So even if I go this dry run minuting, which I just showed you, there are three files here,
one is video and the two are minutes, the transcript and the minutes, which I created. 
So but, there is no, uh, there is nothing here, nothing is coming here.
(PERSON4) Oh.
(PERSON1) I -, I may I interupt you -
(PERSON4) Yeah then, I can -
(PERSON1) May I interupt you two -
(PERSON6) Yeah - 
(PERSON1) For a moment, uh, what is going on now?
What are you trying to do?
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, [PERSON1], so we, uh, no- th-, 
So now that the annotation interface is working on my system,
but then I am actually trying so, this is, this is the uh, interface right.
So I, I just uh, I am launching that interface,
and, so here is the interface.
So I want to up- , I want to, uh, upload the transcript and the minute,
which should appear in these, in this block.
(PERSON1) Did you try that yesterday?
Did it work?
(PERSON6) No, no, we didn't.
We thought it is annotation interface game,
so it will work properly
(PERSON1) Uh-huh.
(PERSON6) So now it is not selecting any, any files, so if I select there is no, it is -
there i-, no TXT file is coming.
And all the minutes and transcripts are .TXT files right?
So I have lots of minutes in my system, which you provided me, 
but none of them is sele- getting selected.
(PERSON4) Um, yeah, I guess uh, there is uh, there are many back and forth, with this uh,
interface, because uh, [PERSON3] has uh, changed something.
And then uh, it was not getting installed, and now like, uh yesterday,
when he looked into that, we tried for several times, and then it got installed.
But really, we didn't s-, like see it coming through that,
it should, it, it, it is not uploading the minutes.
(PERSON1) What does it mean - 
(PERSON4) So uh, next thing -
(PERSON1) What does it mean for me now?
So should it, you need more time, or you need to call [PERSON3] again?
Oh, so what -
(PERSON4) Yeah, we have to call, yeah, we have to call [PERSON3] again,
and uh, so that now this is the -
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/>-
(PERSON4) New problem - 
(PERSON6) Message -
(PERSON4) That popped up.
Yeah.
(PERSON6) Maybe just -
(PERSON1) So -
(PERSON6) Message, let's message on the same zoom room?
And uh, maybe he will, uh, if he is there he can connect now.
What do you say about that?
(PERSON1) Uh.
(PERSON4) Yeah, we, we, we have to talk to him.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON4) So yeah, [PERSON1] you were, you were saying something.
(PERSON1) No, I am just trying to understand what is going on and how can i help.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Oh, okay,
<laugh/>
(PERSON1) <laugh/>
(PERSON4) No, the, the thing is that this has to run and this has to run smoothly.
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) So the thing is uh -
(PERSON1) I understand  
(PERSON4) Without -
(PERSON1) I just thought -
(PERSON4) Without speaker intervention -
(PERSON1) I thought that it is already working, and uh, uh but, it, it doesn't, okay.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so, yeah last day, when the, like i- it took a lot of time to make the interface run -
So -
(PERSON1) Um-hum, um-hum -
(PERSON4) I'm really sceptical that how - 
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) How easily the annotators-
(PERSON6) Annotators -
(PERSON4) Can do it -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON1) Ah, yeah-yeah -
(PERSON4) Because it took a lot -
(PERSON1) Uh. 
(PERSON4) Lot of time with us being the technical persons, but it still took a lot of time for us.
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) Anyways - 
(PERSON1) But it means, what does it mean?
So what should we do -
(PERSON4) Uh -
(PERSON1) What is the.
(PERSON4) It means that, uh, different an-
uh, so that the thing that came out is,
that not all the annotators will have the same kind of operating system, um.
(PERSON1) Yeah -
(PERSON4) Settings - I 
(PERSON1) I understand that there will be a lot of problems.
But how should we solve it?
(PERSON4) We solve it, it.
We have to do for each of the annotators one by one.
Like -
(PERSON1) Uh-uh -
(PERSON4) Try to see what kind of problems they're en-, encountering, 
and uh yeah, so -
(PERSON6) But in case -
(PERSON4) Uh -
(PERSON6) Uh, um, uh, [PERSON4] I think we need to ask [PERSON1] about that,
that they are going to be fixed.
The annotators are fixed, who will be working into this, right?
(PERSON1) What?
(PERSON4) Whoever is the annotator, we have to like have a session with him or her and -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON6) Yeah -
(PERSON4) Get that thing installed, because -
(PERSON1) So should I now choose-
(PERSON4) Really sceptical -
(PERSON1) Uh, should I now choose uh, a person uh, uh to, uh, uh, to begin with?
So for example one annotator, wh- about whom I think,
that he or she could try to install it a- and.
So should we now begin with one of them already?
(PERSON4) Yes, technically yes -
(PERSON6) Uh, we can -
(PERSON4) But let us first do it on our end.
At least first -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) So [PERSON6] can you ping [PERSON3] first?
(PERSON6) Yeah, I did message him on a -
(PERSON4) Ah, you already did -
(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah -
(PERSON6) Uh -
(PERSON4) Yeah. 
(PERSON6) Uh, so uh -
(PERSON4) So -
(PERSON6) Uh-hum.
So what I was saying -
(PERSON4) Yeah, go ahead -
(PERSON6) That we can conduct a session for annotators, for installing into their system, 
but, uh then we need to be sure that this, uh like five person, five uh,
five person who are annotator are, uh, are going to work.
So the uh, annotator should be finalized, who are going to work on-, into this.
And then the second step will be, we will help them to just, uh install this,
uh, annotation tool into their system.
What do you say about that?
(PERSON1) I didn't get, what should I say?
So wha-
(PERSON6) [PERSON1], I was, I was saying that, how many annotators we have for this work, 
are they fixed? 
That we are going to have 5 annotators or 10 an-, annotators -
(PERSON1) Uh, well -
(PERSON6) How many annotators do we have?
Who - 
(PERSON1) Well, we can set up -
(PERSON6) Who are going to work on to this.
Um-hum.
(PERSON1) Uh, well, I can't say that, uh, well,
I- I may ask five people to start working with that.
(PERSON6) Um-hm.
(PERSON1) For example, at the moment -
(PERSON6) Um-hm -
(PERSON1) We can start with five people for example.
So, uh -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Generally, I have about, maybe 10 active annotators at moment -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Really, uh, i- it's it is never a fixed number, because uh, 
I have 23 persons who were engaged, but some of them.
(PERSON6) Hmm.
(PERSON1) They stopped annotating, some of them just begin to annotate,
and some of them, uh for example at the moment, don't have time.
And but, they he had written to me that they will, uh have time in future.
So I suppose that I can ask five people start working with alignment.
(PERSON6) Um-hum.
So I think, uh, uh [PERSON4], uh you will have a clear vision, 
in forming the guidelines in that case, maybe?
And then -
(PERSON4) Yeah, but before that, this should run with us.
(PERSON6) Yes -
(PERSON4) That can be done very quickly, but before that -
(PERSON6) Yeah -
(PERSON4) This interface should run with like at least -
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) We should be ambl-, able to annotate at least two or three meetings,
like randomly, and then we would be able to see the output.
And we give <unintelligible/> the instructions, so this is the meetings, 
this is the minute and this is the ouput, we want from you.
And this is how we are going to communicate with you.
So these things should cared of because first, sin- since we run into another problem.
We have to like again depend on [PERSON3] 
<other_noise/>
and ask him to solve it.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON6) So now, what to do, uh maybe I'm sending him the e-mail as well, 
because I think can prompted in his -
(PERSON1) Uh, I have written him an e-mail, i have just written him memail, e- an e-mail.
(PERSON6) Okay, okay -
(PERSON4) Okay -
(PERSON6) You already have? 
Um-hum.
(PERSON1) Uh, just,
<parallel_talk> calender </parallel_talk>
Well, maybe uh, uh we can stop the call now and afs, as he, uh comes, 
as he answers, we can re- redo it again?
(PERSON6) Um-hum, yes.
(PERSON4) Uh, do you expect that uh, he would answered it now, or?
(PERSON1) I don't know, why not?
(PERSON6) So -
(PERSON4) Okay -
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) We have something else we can discuss in case or when he,
when he says here word back to us, we can discuss this as well.
(PERSON1) Uh, sorry, sorry, I didn't get it again, sorry I probably don't hear it -
(PERSON6) If you have something -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON6) If you have something we can discuss otherwise we can maybe end the call -
(PERSON1) Otherwise.
No I think, it's most important no, for so for me it's no multi-
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Thing, uh, uh I-
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
(PERSON1) Uh, say that it works, say that resolved the problem with [PERSON3],
then the next -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Thing for me, is that I choose five people, five annotators -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) And what?
Should I write them myself, and shou- should I transfer all them to [PERSON4]?
Uh what -
(PERSON6) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Is the next step?
(PERSON4) Uh, next step is [PERSON1], that first this thing should run properly,
at least two or three meetings we should annotate, and then maybe s-, 
like maybe you'd also try to install it on your end.
Like we will, we will help you to do it.
(PERSON1) Okay, um-hum.
(PERSON4) And then when, when we all three or four are confident that okay, 
now it is running fine, we contact the annotators.
Uh, train them maybe for one day -
(PERSON1) Okay -
(PERSON4) Like invite them -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) And say that, that is is how we have to work -
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) And then the job is done from our, from our end.
(PERSON1) Very well -
(PERSON4) Okay -
(PERSON1) Okay -
(PERSON4) But -
(PERSON1) But,
<laugh/>
So but let's wait for [PERSON3] -
(PERSON4) But [PERSON1] -
(PERSON1) So we should be able to open the meeting.
(PERSON4) Uuh, hold on [PERSON1] uh -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) Most importantly than that, is now we have to like very quickly formalize 
our data for the shared task, you know the deadline is near.
(PERSON1) Uh -
(PERSON4) Uh - 
(PERSON1) That means what -
(PERSON4) And because, uh like we have to be very sure,
wha- what is the data with us, okay. 
(PERSON1) So what, uh -
(PERSON4) So we -
(PERSON1) Maybe you shou-, maybe you would kind of describe, what concretely should be done.
So maybe prepare is some table that I will fill in.
(PERSON4) Oh, okay.
I can do that, I can do that.
(PERSON1) Because I -
(PERSON4) Uh -
(PERSON1) I'm not really sure what does it mean formalize, uh-hum.
Probably -
(PERSON4) Yeah, so -
(PERSON1) Yeah, maybe prepare some -
(PERSON4) It, It -
(PERSON1) Empty folder, empty uh, empty uh, table and I will fill it.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so for -
So suppose I tell you, like uh, of all the minuting uh, data,
that we have as part of our minutes, which are the minute we are going to have,
and which we can't uh, like uh -
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> 
(PERSON4) Which can't be a part of our corpus, yeah - 
(PERSON1) Um-hum, um-hum -
(PERSON4) So those, those uh, minutes and then, uh the [ORGANIZATION1], that i have created.
So I guess we all have to see and then decide, because not all the meeting minutes 
are useful, some are, we have to discard, yeah.
(PERSON1) So you want, uh that we see all the data from [ORGANIZATION1] file by file?
(PERSON4) Yeah, maybe yeah.
That's - 
(PERSON1) Um -
(PERSON4) what I'm saying, maybe we can divide that, because there are, 
there are wh-, there are lots of.
So uh -
(PERSON1) Yeah -
(PERSON4) Let me share, so you can understand.
Can you see my screen?
(PERSON1) Not yet, just a moment.
Yes, I can see it.
(PERSON4) You can see right?
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) So you know like, this is the data that we have, 
uh organised according to the dates.
(PERSON1) Each folder is one week?
(PERSON4) So, each folder is one meeting along with its minutes.
(PERSON1) Yes.
(PERSON4) So this is the entire data in the [ORGANIZATION1] corpus, and 
I have organized all that data in form of dates, in which day they occured.
Okay, now you can seems like this, that this is, uh on 17th of January 2000,
but this is only the meeting, we do not have minutes correspondingly, 
because there was none.
(PERSON1) Um-hum, So -
(PERSON4) Okay -
(PERSON1) We'll erase this meeting.
(PERSON4) Yes?
(PERSON1) We should not include it.
(PERSON4) Yeah, because we don't have minutes for it.
(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.
(PERSON4) It's not there on, on the website -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) Okay, now, uh let us come into some, uh random folder,
uh some new data maybe, um, of 2011, yeah, yeah.
So you can see that there are, like there are so many, uh chapters,
of, on this particular date, it is 6th of April 2011, right?
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) And it has so many chapters, but many, you know,
many of the chapters are just blank, they don't have anything inside them.
So if you go inside this, it is just this.
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) So it, it, it, it does not mean anything, right?
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
<another_language/>
So it should be, uh controlled -
(PERSON4) Yeah -
(PERSON1) It should be controlled manually and kind of cleaned up.
(PERSON4) Yeah, I can clean it up automatically, but I think, uh better to do,
in a manual way, so that it's get clear.
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) So, you can see that the majority of these chapters,
do not have anything else, but suppose for this.
Uh, the 4th chapter, this is the 4th chapter of 6th April 2011, right?
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) So yeah, so this is the meeting that happened.
(PERSON1) Yes, and where are the minutes for that? 
(PERSON4) Yeah, the minutes are there only -
Uh, yeah, this is the total minute file, for all the chapters together.
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) OK, so we, we were at the 6th chapter, right?
So this is the minute for the 6th chapter.
(PERSON1) Uh, where can you see that this is 6th chapter?
So, just this?
(PERSON4) You see, this is 6, yeah, yeah, no not just this, six till seven.
You know. 
(PERSON1) And where is that -
(PERSON4) So this one is that -
(PERSON1) Scro-, scroll it down please.
(PERSON4) Yeah -
(PERSON1) To - 
(PERSON4) Uh, yeah -
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) This is 7.
(PERSON1) Um-hum, okay.
(PERSON4) So this is the 6th, yeah
(PERSON1) Uh, uh, please get back, how can I see that I'm in six?
(PERSON4) You, uh in where? 
In the minutes or the, uh -
(PERSON1) Well -
(PERSON4) Meeting -
(PERSON1) Uh, how can I know, uh, 06 is the date, it's not the chapter.
Uh, here is the chapter, uh.
(PERSON4) Yeah, so- sorry this is 04, okay.
(PERSON1) Yes, this is 04 -
(PERSON4) So 04 -
(PERSON1) Not 06, okay -
(PERSON4) So 0, 04, this is chapter yeah.
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) This is the chapter -
(PERSON1) And 06 is the -
(PERSON4) And 6 -
(PERSON1) Yeah, um -
(PERSON4) Yeah is the date, yeah -
(PERSON1) It's okay, it's okay -
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON1) So you want that we, uh some of us will make the manual extortion?
(PERSON4) Uh, the next thing that I can do is, 
that I can split the minutes as, uh in form of chapters.
(PERSON1) I would strongly suggest to do that first automatically, 
maybe mo-, maybe to correct then.
But it's uh, it's really very, very big manual work,
that could be done automatically as for me.
(PERSON4) Yeah, and also, m- uh, I, what I'm trying to do is, 
now, that this is the total entire minute, right?
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) So, I'm trying to split this minute into the corresponding chapters.
(PERSON1) Yes.
(PERSON4) But the thing is the chapters are alt-, are only -
(PERSON1) Yes, also contain  -
(PERSON4) Distinguished by this-
(PERSON1) These numbers, yes, yes.
(PERSON4) Yeah, and these numbers are anywhere in the, uh in the document.
So -
(PERSON1) This -
(PERSON4) I really need to think of a better regular expression to do this, uh -
(PERSON1) Yes -
(PERSON4) Because, yeah - 
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) It is not straightforward, because this 1 and this thing,
you can find many times inside the -
(PERSON1) Well, yeah okay, I understand what you mean, 
totaly, I totaly understand the problem -
(PERSON4) Yeah -
(PERSON1) Uh, but I -
(PERSON4) Um-hum -
(PERSON1) Am not sure, so I don't -, so on uh -, so now, uh different points of view.
I do not know if it is easier or not easier, 
to look for the way to make it automatically.
I think this could be a question to [PERSON2], because I don't ha-
I don't have any experience in that, but [PERSON2] was very, very sure,
that it should be makeable, uh and somehow easy makeable.
Uh, but this is - 
(PERSON4) No, no I'm not saying, that it is not makeable, 
uh, it is, it is, I can do that, but it will take some time,
that's what I'm saying, okay.
(PERSON1) So if to, i- if to sp-, uh spend time for making a script,
or just to make it manually, you think it's quicker manually?
What do you think about it?
(PERSON4) No, no manually it is impossible to do -
(PERSON1) Okay -
(PERSON4) Like there are 959 -
(PERSON1) So what you propose -
(PERSON4) Meetings, it is impossible.
(PERSON1) What you propose -
(PERSON4) I would do it, but I would need some time.
I would need some time to split this into the corresponding,
uh, that like i would split the minutes into the corresponding chapters,
and then, alingn them accordingly, whatever it is there in [ORGANIZATION1].
(PERSON1) So, okay, what should I do now?
In this case, you said that it's really, uh hard enough,
that uh, so we should do it very quickly.
What should I do quickly now?
(PERSON4) Uh, uh so, maybe uh, you can take care of the exact data that is there,
um, thus from the meetings that we are having, so, okay.
So these are the 50, these are the 50, um meetings that we can, um,
release as part of our corpus for the shared task, so freeze that, these are this.
And -
(PERSON1) Uh, so, I should -
(PERSON4) While you do this -
(PERSON1) Shou- now, I should take care for our corpus, our [PROJECT1] corpus,
is it true, is it so?
And, uh make clear -
(PERSON4) Yeah -
(PERSON1) Which meetings we use and which we do not use.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes -
(PERSON1) Okay, um-hum okay and -
(PERSON4) Right -
(PERSON1) With, uh, with, uh [ORGANIZATION1] I, I wait until you, uh split it somehow.
(PERSON4) Yes, so I don't think it will take, uh like maybe by the end of the week, 
it should be ready -
(PERSON1) Okay -
(PERSON4) And I hope so -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) So, yeah.
And yeah, and then like, maybe we do -, we divide the task among <unintelligible/>.
Uh, I can show you the statistics yeah, hold on.
Okay, so I have like, uh organized this, the entire [ORGANIZATION1] corpus about,
uh, how many chapters each of the date con- contents, 
and if they have any minutes or not, okay.
So suppose this is 12 of March 2009, there are 44 chapters uh, for, for
this meeting and there is one minute, because we have not split the minute.
So the, so now the task is, to split the minute into 44 segments or chapters.
(PERSON1) Um-hum. 
(PERSON4) So we have only around i guess 959, we have 959, um meetings
of different dates from the [ORGANIZATION1] corpus, 
but out of them only 427 are heaving overlap -
(PERSON1) Uh -
(PERSON4) With the minutes and the meetings.
(PERSON1) How many? Sorry. 
(PERSON4) Well, 427.
400 and 27.
(PERSON1) 427 meetings have minutes.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON1) And, uh -
(PERSON4) Right -
(PERSON1) Are these 427 are big, uh whole day meetings, 
so they wi- will be further split into, splitted into chapters.
(PERSON4) Correct -
(PERSON1) Uh-huh -
(PERSON4) Correct -
(PERSON1) So they are actually much more.
(PERSON4) Yeah, they are.
They are actually much more -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) Right -
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) Okay.
So, yeah, so so the plan could be, that within this week,
[PERSON1], you try to figure out what kind of data,
we have with us for the [PROJECT1] meetings.
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) And within this week, I figured out, um, what is the f-,
what is the total, uh number of data after splitting in [ORGANIZATION1].
(PERSON1) Um-hum -
(PERSON4) And then in the next week, it is task for all of us,
to like select, that okay, uh this could be a meeting potential,
meeting and this could be a potential minute. 
Because I made a, I made a random pass, and many of the uh,
meetings and the minutes could not be used.
(PERSON1) Um-hum, okay let's try, let's first -
(PERSON4) So -
(PERSON1) See it yeah, let's first -
(PERSON4) Yeah -
(PERSON1) See it and, uh see how it looks like.
(PERSON4) Yeah, okay.
Okay, that sounds good.
So we work, we start working with the [ORGANIZATION1] corpus,
and l- like all of us that which to - we will divide the dates
among ourself and then manually go and see that okay. 
Uh, can we keep this and then we make a separate <unintelligible/> out of them.
(PERSON1) Um-hum.
(PERSON4) Okay.
Okay, uh, yeah, so this is what from the [ORGANIZATION1] site.
<other_noise/>
(PERSON4) So, [PERSON1] are you taking the, uh notes maybe?
(PERSON1) Yes, uh I making it to, uh, to the minutes.
Now, I'm trying to.
(PERSON4) Uh-huh, okay -
(PERSON1) To, to the agenda -
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah -
(PERSON1) <parallel_talk> <unintelligible/> </parallel_talk>
(PERSON4) Yeah, okay.
Ok, so uh, I guess we both were just talking,
So maybe [PERSON6] and [PERSON5] could have some comments that, uh whether,
uh, um about the [ORGANIZATION1] thing or maybe something else?
