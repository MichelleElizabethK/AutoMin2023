<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Uhm, thank you.
Un- unfortunately, I had very little time today.
<censored/>
and uhm even more I so I uhm brought my bicycle to the service.
So I have to go buy food
and t- takes a little bit more time.
(PERSON3) Yes, sure.
So <unintelligible/> I will give give the update from my site.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) So [PERSON4], 
I <unintelligible/> throught <unintelligible/> like seven different challenges in the in the speech community.
(PERSON4) Um-hum.
(PERSON3) And uhm maybe I will saying the you all the <unintelligible/> repaired.
So then the the data varies from task to task.
(PERSON4) Of course.
It's naturally.
(PERSON3) It is- yeah.
So it is like for some task uhm it was like 90 000 hours of data.
So uhm and for some task it was 80 000 hours training data.
And when <unintelligible/> evaluation data.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) So if really ready from task to task.
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) So but-
(PERSON4) Did you analyse did you analyse only speech data?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
These are only on speech data.
(PERSON4) Uhm, okay.
(PERSON3) So, so <unintelligible/> like trying to do now is like I'm trying to finding some dialogues summarization kind of data.  
Because the <unintelligible/> like uhm <unintelligible/> very different from us.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) So I don't know that how <unintelligible/> some one challenge it was the <unintelligible/> challenge.
It was uhm it was it was based on some uhm it was late <unintelligible/> once.
So uhm it was for <unintelligible/> dementia recognition to spontaneous speech, 
it was speech recognition.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) And then there was a challenge it was for zero speech.
So uhm if had data <unintelligible/>
but like the main idea was to do <unintelligible/> learning.
So the data set was really less. 
Uhm size of the da- of of the data.
So <unintelligible/> 70 that released some data that we <unintelligible/> from to our <unintelligible/> minutes to 50 hours.
And uhm can you hear me?
Halo. 
(PERSON4) Yes uhm I just didn't get last sentence from what minutes?
From 20 minutes?
What did you think them.
(PERSON3) To our 30 minutes to 50 hours because <unintelligible/> the data <unintelligible/> some <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yes.
Uhm.
(PERSON3) Okay, okay.
(PERSON4) Uhm, but this this are not meeting so for us it's uhm it doesn't matter.
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, yes.
So I'm trying to find like more <unintelligible/> shared task for our task so I-
(PERSON4) Well, as you are speaking as you are as you are speak- as you are same what you are saying I just understand that uhm we will just release what we can release.
So we can not do anything, 
we can uhm so we can it seems that it is still realizable that our data is not so little
uhm we will and I also have some new information -  uhm say you now,
so we will we will can we can extend the data uhm quite significantly.
(PERSON3) Yeah, 
so uhm this this this idea is really good,
like to do on [ORGANIZATION3] data,
uhm and uhm since there are more structured so the quality of our data would be better
and also uhm the problem that we <unintelligible/>  challenges that would <unintelligible/> 
because the [ORGANIZATION3] data is uhm public available.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) So I think-
(PERSON4) So may I may I spea- yes, 
may I speak a little about [ORGANIZATION3] dat- [ORGANIZATION3] data?
(PERSON3) Yes, sure.
It's it's going.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) So uhm the the last thing we just last thing, [PERSON4] from <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) To the there was another challenge from uhm <unintelligible/> steps will where did provided <unintelligible/> so ground should data should  training and development set 
and aditional <unintelligible/> for the evaluation data.
(PERSON4) Uhm, could you write it down please in in uhm in to-
(PERSON3) Okay, so so we <unintelligible/> [PERSON4].
(PERSON4) Write this into mail.
<unintelligible/>
Which doc?
(PERSON3) I have <unintelligible/> of the valiable <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Oh, okay.
(PERSON3) So let me sending then that would be easier to our <unintelligible/>?
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) Okay, so please going.
You are telling some thing of the [ORGANIZATION3].
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> I just amount of data set uhm okay.
Uhm as for [ORGANIZATION3] <unintelligible/> data set uhm 
so [PERSON6] now clean the data <unintelligible/>  prepared meaningful there with difference size of meeting.
We will get to that a little bit uhm later.
And I I have found that [ORGANIZATION3] meetings also have minutes 
and this minutes are foundable so we can find for these meetings we have
based in on chapter ID and dates of meetings which are in the name of- in the names of the files we can find minutes.
And if you could look at the agenda for todays talk,
you can uhm you can find the link to the example.
Who [PERSON6] are you there?
(PERSON6) Yes, I'm here.
(PERSON4) Uhm could you go to the agenda please?
Uhm I also please ask you to all our calls use the agendas
so that we can kind get kind of all have do what is going on. 
(PERSON6) So what where find the agenda?
(PERSON4) You will always find it in your c- [ORGANIZATION4] calendar in the reference to the meeting.
If you go-
(PERSON6) Ooh, okay.
(PERSON4) you al- you always find the link to the meeting,
and the link to the agenda.
(PERSON6) Okay, so.
(PERSON4) Are you there?
(PERSON6) Agenda uhm yes, uhm.
<unintelligible/>
So yes. 
(PERSON4) Ah, uhm somewhere in between.
There is a [ORGANIZATION3] meeting at example of minutes.
So please open that this link 
and look if it is okay with this example.
So there are rearly example so they are really kind of short meeting is short minutes <unintelligible/> all the meetings. 
And we actually do not need to annotate them again, 
but we can extend <unintelligible/> then find them.
So it will take time off <unintelligible/>.
So it's really I <unintelligible/> task I would probably more likely asked  the annotators to do than to do myself, 
uhm but if-
(PERSON6) Uhm, yes, maybe I I'm not sure if it is <unintelligible/> minute.
(PERSON4) You don't like.
(PERSON6) I'm not sure it's <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Oh, which one is the minute?
(PERSON4) Uhm, so the this uhm it contains six lines report on fall all up bla bla bla the yeah the young [] introduce their <unintelligible/> meeting.
(PERSON3) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
(PERSON4) Uhm it's really not very good,
the <unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON4) Bla, bla, bla.
They the...
<laugh/> 
(PERSON3) They are just <unintelligible/> but <unintelligible/> sections <unintelligible/> sections.
So.
(PERSON4) Well, actually I have looked that the 10 minutes ago, 
probably uhm uhm
I have just to spend some minutes for that.
And I didn't <unintelligible/> the details.
Probably we can find-
(PERSON6) No, no, no.
So I think it-
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> we can find probably we can find something more.
So maybe this is just a short,
and there is there is something more, 
yeah on <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) So I think it's it's uhm <unintelligible/>.
Oh it's cool I mean you go to the next <unintelligible/> the run minutes for each paragraph for each yes, 
for each section,
so where 24 sections 
and run minutes for each section.
Uhm.
(PERSON4) Where do you see it?
(PERSON6) Yes, yes, it's it's completly.
(PERSON3) It seems nice.
(PERSON4) Uhm, where what do you <unintelligible/> 
may I also see what you see?
(PERSON6) You have to go to the <unintelligible/> next full text,
you can <unintelligible/> full text  there and you will find it.
(PERSON4) Ahaaa.
Ahaa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON6) So uhm but point this <unintelligible/> this example do we have can we find is there such an example for all of those uhm.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes, we have <unintelligible/> all uhm<unintelligible/>  [ORGANIZATION3] commu- meetings for-
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) but for all [ORGANIZATION3] [ORGANIZATION3] uhm meetings, 
and there are if they are much more than the just [ORGANIZATION3] corpus.
The [ORGANIZATION3]- 
(PERSON3) This is <unintelligible/> this is very structured and
(PERSON6) So-
Yes, you are at this point there is still some lot of work to do manual <unintelligible/> work to do for annotators
but we we have to know, we have to plan the now we have to really plan  <unintelligible/> annotators.
Because we would give them s- uhm the whole transcript 
and this website with this minutes 
and then they will have to somehow.
(PERSON4) So this yeah this was the idea. 
(PERSON6) something.
(PERSON4) This was the idea 
and now uhm if we if all of us agree that we take the the minutes as they are, 
or if the ha-
if we should change them somehow.
And if we take them as as we are what we want to get as the output.
So some <unintelligible/> basic samples of of the <unintelligible/> [PERSON6] do producer an example. 
Uhm and uhm the size of the meetings.
The size of [ORGANIZATION3].
(PERSON6) So [ORGANIZATION3]-
(PERSON4) The they are really different<unintelligible/>the  minutes 
and different so it's <unintelligible/> another part of the data set with is which is not uhm identical,
what we already have.
But  this-
(PERSON6) But the problem is the problem is to match this minutes the to match this minutes with the whole meeting like.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
This is what I say, 
we shou- we have to do.
So we have to find uhm uhm transcripts from [ORGANIZATION3] for example, 
that we want to get minutes for
and give the task for the annotators the find and they correspond in minutes.
(PERSON6) So probably <unintelligible/> this?
(PERSON4) You can find it so they are searchable.
(PERSON6) So yes the results to the PDF doc <unintelligible/> difference form <unintelligible/> that's okay,
but I don't know how to navigate from this meeting to another.
So this is 11 on October 11 2006 so there is not-
(PERSON4) And this uhm October 11 uhm these 24 kind of minutes are different chapters.
(PERSON6) Yes, 
the different chapters of the entire discussion.
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm. 
(PERSON6) So they a very long like yes they are one one day session for the [ORGANIZATION3] <unintelligible/>
and there are.
(PERSON4) Well just a moment [PERSON6] just a moment. 
This is what I have written in the gender <unintelligible/> say,
so you have excerpted sound articles.
For example, if I look at uhm the document uhm just uhm just wait a little bit I will presented.
[PROJECT1] minute with [ORGANIZATION3] I will share the screen uhm share the screen yeah.
Can you see my screen? 
Probably yes.
Uhm [PERSON6], are you there?
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) Yes, so here is your so here are the folders from [ORGANIZATION3] you excerpted.
(PERSON6) Yes on the source data.
(PERSON4) Yeah, 
I have just opened  uhm something uhm <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> and open this uhm and found this file.
[ORGANIZATION3] 06 11 20.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) Than I just copy that here, 
I opened it 
and-
(PERSON6) Oh, so we have it.
Yes, so the data-
(PERSON4) Yes, this is from our data,
I have opened it I.
(PERSON6) Okay. 
(PERSON4) And I I found the name.
And this is probably.
(PERSON6) Okay, so, so
the annotators can just look at the file names and uhm-
(PERSON4) Yes we can just excerpt some group here
we can just excerpt some folders say for each annotator for example.
And he will from these files he will create basics samples.
Use it them in minutes he will find.
So they are not long.
So for for this uhm file, 
we have <unintelligible/> of minutes.
(PERSON3) So will they just <unintelligible/> just grab the where that say.
(PERSON4) I didn't understand you.
What you scrap <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) They will just webscrape the annotators will <unintelligible/> websites.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
So they they their input  will be this <unintelligible/> file
and  they will open it find the name search for the minutes
and create the new output which already contains th- this files on this co- copy-pasted part 
and plus say summary and copy-pasted part if what is there.
(PERSON6) So yes,
I <unintelligible/> the chapter these right now <unintelligible/> 
So in the <unintelligible/> don't have a chapter ID,
it's just one chapter.
In that day let say  
or that meeting-
(PERSON4) Yeah, oh is it does it happen that in one file contains more then one chapter?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) No one one part is only one chapter.
(PERSON4) Aha.
(PERSON6) But the <unintelligible/> several chapters to one date.
(PERSON4) Uhm yes, yes, yes, 
this is this is a chapter ID 1, to review.
(PERSON6) Not <unintelligible/> with many chapters <unintelligible/> yes, yes.
(PERSON4) Ahaa, okay.
(PERSON6) Chapter ID 87, 22 and uhm.
(PERSON4) Chapter <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Also I can <unintelligible/> that the minutes are could be downloading <unintelligible/> files.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes, I also tried that.
I uhm I opened uhm the uhm minutes okay,
it doesn't matter actually.
(PERSON3) Yeah, good.
(PERSON4) But it's good to know. 
Uhm.
So what can we take out <unintelligible/>?
I propose that we create that maybe uhm that we create the folders with files of the link minute.
But we should decide how much data we need.
So this is our uhm how much meetings.
(PERSON3) We should decide what, what [PERSON4]?
(PERSON4) The amount of data, 
how much how much such meetings from [ORGANIZATION3] we we want to have,
as much as possible yes?
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON3) How much we can.
Yes, yes,
how much we can.
As-
(PERSON4) Well, it seem that it is in in it doesn't have any end.
It's really a lot of.
<laugh/>
(PERSON3) Okay.
So let us let us target at least 100 meetings fast in the fast goes.
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/> 
how uhm 100 meetings it's not it's not a problem at all,
why you should decided beforehand, 
is because of tdecides is because of there and how we choose the meeting.
So if [PERSON6] excerps <unintelligible/> if [PERSON6] excerps the meeting which- meetings which are 5000 to 10000 <unintelligible/> uhm long uhm well it's okay then if we finish we can start with other language.
(PERSON3) So [PERSON4], I I can think of another challenge with this,
like uhm if we can have uhm differents types of data like some data will be fixed for <unintelligible/>short meetings
and some data would be for a longer version of the minute- of the meetings, 
so that the participants could submit two models.
One would be specifically <unintelligible/> for the shorter meetings.
And another one for the longer meetings so.
(PERSON4) Okay, 
why not. Uhm.
(PERSON3) Yeah.
(PERSON5) [PERSON4]  <unintelligible/> with [PERSON6] because you are you are-
(PERSON4) Ehm, so.
(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> screen sharing.
(PERSON4) Okay, what is the problem?
<unintelligible/> 
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> data, 
so why not we divided like medium size meetings, short size meeting then long 
be- because the the models the machine learning models that would work of <unintelligible/> meetings would be good for the longer one, so-
(PERSON4) Okay, [PERSON3] do you have any idea,
do you have any idea we are short meetings end 
and we don't meetings begin at what what is the border line,
how many words?
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, that is something we have to late brainstorm, 
or maybe looking in to the data 
and take decides. 
(PERSON4) I think I think you should I think you and [PERSON6] may then [PERSON1] shoud decide 
because I for me doesn't make any uhm,
so I can just say that our meetings are say about 8000 words long,
this what's [PERSON6] s um  computation.
So our our I mean [PROJECT1] as a one our meeting is about 8000 words long 
and please make the border lines.
And you [PERSON3] say them to [PERSON6]
and [PERSON6] will create folders according to these sizes.
And I will give them to annotators.
If I may ask you to do that to I don't know Monday to our next meeting.
(PERSON3) Yes, yes.
Let me let me do a study
and will quickly get back to you with my study, 
maybe back tomorrow or later.
Yeah.
(PERSON4) Yes, so this is what we need first uhm firstly 
and then-
(PERSON6) Wait, wait, it's not to please don't go don't  <unintelligible/> like
<laugh/>
first we have the <unintelligible/> of minutes,
because I'm checking right now the minutes 
and maybe there are not really what we need,
so.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON6) So don't really go that fast in those thing,
so.
(PERSON4) Okay. 
(PERSON6) Uhm.
(PERSON4) On behalf on behalf yes well <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) It's not really dialogues.
So.
(PERSON4)  Dialogues?
They are dialogues, 
so when you look at the originals.
They actually people do speak,
so this they are not dialogues <unintelligible/> sence.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> not spontaneous dialogues.
I think.
<unintelligible/> there are dialogues like but they are like each of the <unintelligible/> speaking something.
(PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON3) but it doesn't not spontaneous <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yes, they are not spontaneous
and <unintelligible/> they are in different languages.
I suppose.
So if you look in a in the [ORGANIZATION3] uhm on the [ORGANIZATION3] website,
you can look at uhm videos of uh they are uhm meetings.
And each first speaks in his language,
so actually the these are not really dialogues, 
but short speaches.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) And this is the problem,
yes so if if this is a problem,
we should just uhm forget about [ORGANIZATION3] corpus, 
and release our 100 our.
(PERSON6) No, no.
I think the point here is to to have the annotators to  give them these match.
Lets say transcript 
and website with minutes
and have them read these minutes of kind of <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Maybe, uhm.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> spontaneous speech lets say
and remote this things for example <unintelligible/>  question <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Why do you mean by spontaneous speech?
They can not make this speech in [ORGANIZATION3]?
(PERSON6) In a sence like <unintelligible/> everyday live speech lets say.
Not this very strict formal language.
Report of the proposal <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Maybe, maybe.
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> so this are not really very useful.
(PERSON4) So you mean well actually it's not so formal <unintelligible/>
I just read it.
Introdu-  somebody introduced the report.
Somebody spoke somebody.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) Yeah, it's not very formal.
It's not uhm but it al- it's also not very i- i-  informal in- it's very not very informative.
You just get the idea that somebody introduced <unintelligible/>
but uhm you don't know from the minutes what did he <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON6) Yes.
(PERSON4) And this is that the problem.
I see more problem in that it doesn't contain any information.
(PERSON6) Yes, the <unintelligible/> yes. 
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON6) Brr.
What are <unintelligible/> what is <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Our meetings also as sometimes our minutes are also little bit that somebody report it.
But I tried to make then annotators also reflected content.
So I really try it.
I I didn't always have success.
And it's an <unintelligible/> so some to the minutes are all around the formal and not informative uhm the annotators really didn't understand the context, 
but sometimes they are more informative. 
They are different. 
You I'm sorry, guys, I have to leave.
Maybe you will think a little bit more about long about that.
And I will then listen to that, 
maybe you write it somewhere to the agenda.
<censored/>
(PERSON3) So I think [PERSON4] you were <unintelligible/>required for discussing the data.
So.
(PERSON4) What? Uhm, uhm.
(PERSON3)  <unintelligible/> required for discussing the data.
So why I would propose that uhm <unintelligible/> go throught the [ORGANIZATION3] meeting 
and the minutes and try to understand that uhm <unintelligible/> include this in our data set.
(PERSON4) Okay, so uhm.
(PERSON3) And than give back give back tomorrow with our inputs.
(PERSON4) Tomorrow? 
No.
Tomorrow not. 
(PERSON3) Oh, tomorrow is sorry sorry. 
Late.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) Monday, Monday.
Sorry.
(PERSON4) <censored/>
It seems to be <unintelligible/>.
But I can 
(PERSON3) And what about [PERSON2]?
And what about [PERSON2], <unintelligible/> [PERSON2] because very to take important decisons about these things, 
so.
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON6) You should join us you should join us in one of this meetings. 
(PERSON4) Yes, 
uhm but we can prepare our decision before he.
So uhm.
(PERSON3) Because you interested with the [ORGANIZATION3] meetings.
It seems so from <unintelligible/> this minutes. 
(PERSON4) So I feel that you like [ORGANIZATION3] meetings.
Ah at the same thing this time I feel that it is uhm very different
and that's why we didn't take it from the very beginning, 
because this speechs and not a spontaneous are they are in different languages.
And so so on.
Another thing that actually add should be also other sources.
So it sure is to all the political meetings also have minutes.
So it's not a problem to find a minutes of [ORGANIZATION3] 
I don't know [ORGANIZATION2] uhm meetings.
And ask annotators to uhm make transcripts for that, 
for example, 
so maybe it could also <unintelligible/>.
Lets really-
(PERSON3) And in that case, you can directly  ask them to to summarize this [ORGANIZATION3] transcript,
to transcript already good.
I'm.
(PERSON4) Uhm.
(PERSON3) The point was to shorter on the worker of the annotators.
So this thing that you found in the where this minutes the point of using it's, is not use it.
(PERSON4) Yes, yes, yes, yes.
But if-
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> is use exactly as it is,
because it's not very good.
(PERSON4) Yes, but-
(PERSON3) But the transcripts, but the transcripts are very good, 
so very good transkripts and not very good minutes.
So the point is to somehow plan uh kind of activity-
(PERSON4) But it's also not a spontaneous speech, 
it's not spontaneous speeches that uhm.
(PERSON3) Yes, yes, the transcript some not very spontaneous 
but there are well structure and uhm minute.
There are some kind of of dialogues. 
Some <unintelligible/> meeting dialogues.
They represent some kind of real realistic meeting dialogues,
because not whole meeting dialogues are spontaneous.
So they are there should be somehow included.
Not-
(PERSON4) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
(PERSON3) but <unintelligible/> not completely but the so the problem is how to plan the annotation proceder.
(PERSON4) Yes. It's also, yes, yes.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> this transcript check this transcripts procedures the website with all this <unintelligible/>
(PERSON4) Uhm
(PERSON3) And then somehow produces better-
(PERSON4) Yeah better produces just uhm <unintelligible/> more <unintelligible/>.
Yes it could be done.
(PERSON3) This is the point how to plan how to plan the kind of annotation procedure that is create from the annotators but they have to <unintelligible/> like <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Well.
Oh.
I think they can <unintelligible/>,
so they already have some experience with uhm creating m-
(PERSON3) Oh.
(PERSON4) And if they get some uhm some <unintelligible/> they can uhm put more content in in that.
I don't see any problem <unintelligible/>.
So but we should uhm take the decision if we do that.
So we should be really-
(PERSON6) No I would <unintelligible/> have [PERSON2] I would <unintelligible/> have [PERSON2].
It will <unintelligible/> about them.
(PERSON4) Yeah, 
of course we we will take the decision with with with [PERSON2] together.
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON3) So yes.
So yes <unintelligible/> search for something similar like [ORGANIZATION2], 
[ORGANIZATION3] uhm there should be some consider.
Yes but but <unintelligible/> transkripts 
and then I don't know <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON4) Yes, why why I'm speaking about other sources is because of different languages <unintelligible/>.
So it's really very, very unnatural situation.
As I looked at videos now
because you see one person's speaken <unintelligible/> for two minutes,
the uhm uhm and he is getting kind of translated to uhm <unintelligible/> languages, 
European languages then another person is speeking <unintelligible/>.
And that first third person <unintelligible/> required the English
and so it's really it can be hard- hardly uhm understood as a spontaneous conversation it's really on European languages.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible/>
within the minutes which uhm like <unintelligible/> to something different?
So does <unintelligible/> of the minutes are uhm not very straightforward.
(PERSON4) Mm-hmm.
(PERSON3) In the [ORGANIZATION3].
So I've been through a couple of minutes.
But some minutes are very, very different forms sponataneous meetings.
And and-
(PERSON4) Yeah.
(PERSON3) There are mostly <unintelligible/>
(PERSON6) Because-
(PERSON4) Yes, yes.
And no information just names names <unintelligible/> reported <unintelligible/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Uhm so clear I I'm sorry I really have to leave.
And uhm that's maybe let us make this decision on Monday with [PERSON2].
Lets prepare their idea, please pre- both of you prepare uhm kind of your opinion.
What do you think and write it down to the agenda.
So that we decided together.
Yes?
(PERSON6) So one more thing.
Now I guess we are completely the chat of [ORGANIZATION4],
so somebody please cripple down <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION1] chat, [ORGANIZATION1] hangout 
and because we don't need it anymore.
We have all people in [ORGANIZATION4].
Okay,
so who is uhm the administrator of this.
(PERSON4) [PERSON3].
(PERSON6) So [PERSON3] please remove everything,
we don't need everything here.
Right?
(PERSON3) So you one to delete that uhm conversation?
(PERSON6) Yes, <unintelligible/> conversation of [ORGANIZATION1] hangout,
so we have everything we need now in [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON3) Okay, but w- w- what is the point of deleting that?
(PERSON6) Because we don't need it.
I guess, the content is already I mean,
I think we have some importantly <unintelligible/>.
(PERSON3) Yeah, <unintelligible/> we we won't check word this.
(PERSON6) Why you don't would like to leave content in [ORGANIZATION1].
So. 
If we don't need it with deleted. 
(PERSON3) Okay.
But I think there is there are some important links shared
I don't-
okay let me to check.
(PERSON6) Yes, you can check a little bit.
I'm checking right now. 
But some in usually it's usually zoom links that we already use like the previous meetings,
our spreadsheet that we have.
