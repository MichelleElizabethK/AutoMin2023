[PROJECT2] [PROJECT4], 19.08.2020
Attendees: [PERSON6], [PERSON3], [PERSON7], [PERSON8], [PERSON4], [PERSON5]
Purpose of meeting: [PROJECT2] dry run, presenting new work packages, brief overview of the project

Summary
• this presentation was kind of a extension of a demo which was ran for project officer 
• [ORGANIZATION12] is the coordinator of the project
• [PROJECT2] is a research and innovation project
• few research partners ([ORGANIZATION8],[ORGANIZATION1])
• integration partner ([ORGANIZATION9] - [LOCATION3]), user partner ([ORGANIZATION10])
• six core languages (English, German, Czech, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian)
• [ORGANIZATION2] languages are 24 EU + 19 additional languages
• Work package 1 - data collection
	• it is a central role in the project
	• 43 target languages
	• sampled large multilingual parallel corpus
	• EU project Paracrawl - focused on cooling a parallel data
	• 40 000 sentences per language
	• collected data is used to evaluate ASR, MT and SLT systems
	• 92hours worth of meetings in ENG, 50hours in Czech
• Work package 2 - ASR
	• sequent to sequent models is wanted
	• several components of ASR had latency problems
	• two second delay in the online system
• Work package 3 - spoken language translation
	• ASR and MT work together better
	• ASR produces imperfect transcript, so MT is used to make it perfect
	• ASR and segmentation are changing, could be real problem
	• latency and flicker are both user interface issues
	• bad ASR means most of the segmentations are very disruptive for MT
	• [PROJECT3] is how much the translation changes meeting updates
• Work package 4 - multilingual machine translation
	• baseline models - 3-4 [ORGANIZATION2] languages
	• some of the models are English centric
	• idea is to have one neural network which translates into several languages at once
	• other focus is on multi source translation
	• training is on 10 000 language pairs from 100 languages
• Work package 5 - machine translation
	• populate the agenda topics with the corresponding conclusions of the minute
	• different segments of clusters for even up to 10 sentences
	• preliminary scores - current prototype reaches up to 16%
• Work package 6 - integration and deployment
	• face to face conferencing, and remote meetings
	• developing presentation layer integrated with the [ORGANIZATION9] service architecture
• ethical matters problem - collect consents from human participants
• make meeting recordings as anonymous as possible for persons who doesnt agree on being recorded

		Milestones
