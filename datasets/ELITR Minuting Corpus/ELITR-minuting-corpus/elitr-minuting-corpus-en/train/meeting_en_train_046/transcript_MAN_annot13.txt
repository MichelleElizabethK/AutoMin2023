(PERSON12) Hello. Does it work?
I don't hear anything.
(PERSON1) <another_language/>
(PERSON12) <another_language/>
Hi [PERSON5].
(PERSON5) Hi [PERSON12].
(PERSON12) Yeah. 
Yeah.
I'm.
I see people coming in. 
That's great.
Yeah.
I am totally failing to get down to the SLT <unintelligible/> IW SLT evaluation.
The deadline is May the 20th?
(PERSON5) The 27th.
(PERSON12) 27th, yeah, yeah, Okay.
Yeah. It's getting worse and worse.
<laugh/>
Yep.
Okay.
(PERSON5) I think this weekend. 
If we speak the weekend, we can put time on it, but don't worry about it.
I I I'm just doing my stuff, and I'm not contributing in [PROJECT4] now.
And so it's not blocking things.
But I think maybe this week <parallel_talk> Yeah.</parallel_talk> we should have a meeting and decide about it. 
And just-.
I am touch, I am in touch with [PERSON2].
And [PERSON2] is preparing that, that Jupiter.
So I think everything is there and everything is fine.
I saw it and it's good.
So now we need you know something to me and you decide together I think so.
(PERSON12) Yeah. 
I am happy to hear that it it's making a good progress.
Yeah, Okay. 
Great.
I see most of you are actually here, thanks.
So let's, let's go quickly over the topics that you have listed.
Today is the last Tuesday meeting before I have to somehow close the Surge points for this month.
And so if you have not listed yourself yet, this is the last call.
And I'll I'll somehow process it onwards.
So just serious reminder.
And then on Friday we're running the demo for the Project Officer and it is 
surprisingly complicated.
Be, given how many tests we have already done.
So I'm I'm really like-.
I was not anxious before the preparations for the demo started.
And I'm getting more and more anxious as as they are running.
And uh, I have 2 questions for [PERSON6] because today he mentioned in another call that we had, that we lost some of the copies of the of the [ORGANIZATION7] model.
Is is s that true?
Can you-?
(PERSON6) That is definitely true.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So this is-.
(PERSON6) I tried get it back from-.
So actually had some autom some scripts also which made work-.
Oh sorry.
I also had some scripts which made the work easier.
Those have also been deleted.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So this is a big big warning for everybody.
Never, never keep only one copy of things.
Always have things versioned and always have things like on multi, in multiple directories.
So to say.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
Probably you are right.
(PERSON12) So and and and if you remember many months ago.
Uh.
I have set up with directory in net data [PROJECT4], which was called something like models.
Uh.
And that was supposed to be the copy off all the systems or maybe systems. 
Net net data [PROJECT4] systems.
And that was supposed to be like a static back-up copy of all the systems.
Uh.
So that if anything goes wrong, we would have a a source to to copy them over.
So, so, how much work is is needed to get this to get this local copy up again.
(PERSON6) So actually I have the links from [PERSON14] so I just need to download them.
So that is not a-.
So that is like-.
Almost like 50 percent work and then I get into to do more 50 percent.
Like writing the scripts again.
Then, as you said, you need also domain adaptation.
And.
Yeah.
(PERSON12) So these days there is no way to do the quick domain adaptation that we used to do? 
(PERSON6) No, not quickly. 
Like single person, not like a key person.
(PERSON12) And it used to be like that?
(PERSON6) It used to, yeah.
(PERSON12) That's-
<laugh/>
Okay.
That is really a very big warning for for, everybody make.
It is much better to have half the the mess in the files and too many copies,
then to have one copy somewhere, because accidentally can get deleted or or damaged.
And it's then, yeah, okay.
So the talk level domain adaptation is also out of question for the Fri for the Friday session, right?
(PERSON6) Yeah, that could be all released subject to worry right now, so.
Like right now our main focus should be to get the pipeline and the whole system running successfully at least.
You don't want to lose that.
Forget about the domain adaptation level.
(PERSON12) Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And my last question bef before I let others speak well. 
<other_noise/>
It's stupid.
Is if anybody has ever tried injecting sound output to an application which is recording the microphone.
So, what we want to do is to-.
Imagine that I wanted to play a music to all of you now.
So what should I do?
How how should I send the sound from the Music Player whatever M Player into the exip call.
And I've read that player control should be able to do that.
But I've actually failed.
So I've found a link-.
So if anybody has ever experimented with with redirecting sound in Linux, please let me know
(PERSON6) Yeah.
Just give me a minute and I can try it.
(PERSON12) Yeah, Okay.
So actually, I think that it works for everything.
Except-
I try it now.
If you will hear some some strange Czech person talking instead of me, then I have successfully switched it.
(PERSON6) Do you hear something?
So, did you guys hear something?
<another_language/>
(PERSON1) I hear a Czech lady talking.
<another_language/>
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON6) Yes, we can h-.
<another_language/>
(PERSON5)  Yes, I think [PERSON12] we cannot hear you.
(PERSON12) And now you can hear me again and not the lady anymore.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON9) Yes.
(PERSON6) I think you change the sound setting and took the input from the monitor, right?
(PERSON12)  Yes, but this was not possible with Zoom.
So Zoom ignored this. So that's a problem of the Zoom platform.
(PERSON5) Maybe you could just br bring the Zoom on the Zoom developer forum and they they will probably reply to you even in like a day.
(PERSON12) They will reply.
I saw some messages which where they said it's only in Windows and Mac OS.
(PERSON5) Oh, yes.
That's that's the desktop kind. 
(PERSON12) [PERSON12], I think Zoom has.
You need to configure the input sound for Zoom separately.
So if you're seeing Zoom at the bottom left, there is a mike option.
And if you click there is a-.
I will open a dialog box, which has a list of input sources.
And I think you need to explicitly change it there.
(PERSON12) Okay, so.
So if.
So that.
Let's lets dis discuss it later with [PERSON6] when I managed to get to work.
So I'll I'll get there around 5 I guess.
And then we will try it.
Ok, so it's. 
Thank you for for this test and yeah-.
It's always little bit more complicated than than we like expect.
Yeah, okay.
So with [PERSON3] there is now no need to ask for for the domain that talk level adaptation.
(PERSON6) No. We should definitely have it in case it runs you know-.
I can like manually do the things.
I can get it ready.
So I I definitely want the domain adapted words to get, to have ready in hand at least.
(PERSON12) Okay. 
But we don't have.
We never had the German ASR, right?
(PERSON6) No, no, no no. We we didn't have German ASR.
(PERSON12) So for English there is nothing to-.
There could be like our [PROJECT4] talks that we could list in.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So I'll think about it ans I'll ask [PERSON3] what what he can prepare for for Friday. 
It's very very soon.
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
So now, let's go over the list.
So [PERSON11].
Oh, yes, [PERSON11] is on mock con interpreting conference.
I would like to join that when get to work as well.
And he was reviewing the data from the past mock conference.
Fixed some bug, going to-
Yeah, yeah. 
So so there is an [PROJECT3] submission, which we did.
And there is still 3 days to update it .
So, uh, and then.
And then so there is some sense things delated related to the paper.
Then uh, we should receive the feedback on our IW SLT submissions in 3 days, again.
And then we will have 10 days to improve the paper.
And the important thing is to work on the SLT deliverables for the [PROJECT4].
Okay, that's that's good.
So I did it.
I did the summary for [PERSON11].
And now, [PERSON2], he is working-
Oh, you are here, right?
(PERSON2) Yes.
Yes, I'm listening to you more right now than to the conference so.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So was there anything you wanted to add?
(PERSON2) I replied to [PERSON10]- [PERSON10] about the SLT yesterday by email.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
And I fixed one bug in the back end ASR.
So [PERSON6] if you are using it, then you can pull new version.
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
Yeah.
I'm using it right now.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON12) Yeah.
Yeah. 
So, speaking at, still getting back to [PERSON6] and the demo for the Project Officer.
Who is available for or-
[PERSON6] are there tasks where you need a hand?
Do you need some coders who would frantically help you in bug fixing?
(PERSON6) Like what kind of bug fixing are we are we talking about?
(PERSON12) Exactly.
That's the, that's like-.
Is there something that you could delegate?
(PERSON6) I I I'm sorry.
I didn't get your question.
Like what is-.
(PERSON12) Is there, is there something that you could get some help with?
Like getting something running, getting to putting together script which whatever-.
Ways-.
(PERSON6) Like some extra hand.
Kind of.
(PERSON6) Yeah. Some extra hand?
(PERSON12) Hmm. 
Yeah. 
I mean-.
(PERSON2) I think the best would be if someone reviewed the scripts before the event.
(PERSON6) Yes.
Yes.
I would like kin kind of tester kind of.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So someone who would be kind starting the pipeline from scratch, right?
Like on his machine, getting getting the same set up running.
(PERSON2) Yes.
(PERSON12) Is that the thing?
(PERSON2) Yeah, and just check the outputs whether languages are correct.
Whether there are not some duplicated lines in the output.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON12) Yeah, I saw I saw the EN language text in in interleaved with in the Romanian outputs and things like that.
(PERSON6)  So today I had an issue that the German to English [PROJECT5] worker, it has been integrated with [PERSON11]'s [PROJECT6] wrapper and it it it-.
I mean it was running successfully until few days back.
I tested it during the weekends but it was repeatedly failing today.
And there is like a specific error which I see now and then or along with other workers also.
I I exactly don't know how it is.
Maybe when I I can talk to [PERSON11] about it.
(PERSON12) Yeah, so-.
So the now in this call who would be available for this immediate help, and and bug fixing in the coming days?
So I'm looking at at the list of you, who are present in the call.
I can think only of [PERSON1] actually and [PERSON4].
<laugh/>
I think you're the the only 2 candidates, who could help immediately.
(PERSON1) But, maybe I m- what  <unintelligible/>
Is there like some exact work that needs to be coded?
I can-
(PERSON12) Not. Not yet.
(PERSON1) I can help to co code something if it's if you need hands [PERSON6].
(PERSON12) But we are-.
Various debugging.
For example the testing whether the port is free or not.
So [PERSON6] are we going to use back end ASR or are we going to use the old set up.
(PERSON6) Back end ASR. Back end ASR.
(PERSON12) Okay.
So the back end ASR that connect to mediator and that's it, right?
(PERSON6) Yep. 
And if you're worry for the pipe like checking if the pipe if the port is and came on, I've already fixed that.
In my current.
So when I s at the check-
When I start the [PROJECT1] it starts locally, it first-
(PERSON12) It will tell you.
(PERSON6) No.
It will delete.
It will kill all the exi existing [PROJECT1] server in there.
And just start the new.
(PERSON12) This is again risky.
Because imagine that you run the script where you actually want some other instance running.
So, it's-
This, yeah, this is the w-.
It is a working solution but it is a risky solution. 
(PERSON6) Yeah.
This is like, I don't know, I kind of agree, kind of.
(PERSON12) Yeah, so, but can we?
I think it would be, yes.
So what we could do, is that is that we would give one of the set ups to [PERSON1] and [PERSON1] should test it so that it runs.
And another set up to [PERSON4].
If [PERSON4] is here.
[PERSON4] are you are you on the call?
(PERSON4) Yeah I am here. 
I just I just don't know if I if I will have enough time.
How how much do you estimate that it could it could be in hours?
(PERSON12) It's only until Friday.
Friday at 10 is the event.
So actually it's like tomorrow, and today tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and how much you can give.
Because it will involve some learning how to run it.
(PERSON4) Yes, so maybe like I I have I have very little time these days.
So maybe.
If it woks, I can do it.
But but if something breaks I can't guarantee that I will have the time to-.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So, let's not count on you at all.
And and [PERSON1], you are you available kind of in these days?
(PERSON1) Yeah. 
I can ha, I will have some time on a Thursday.
So-.
(PERSON12) So, that's too late.
(PERSON1) Maybe tomorrow like evening.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
Yeah.
So, we'll yeah we'll.
Maybe we'll send you some some command that you should try running regularly and let us know if that worked for you or not. 
And maybe not.
Okay. 
So that's.
Yeah.
So thanks.
I I think that's that's that's it for now.
We we cannot like do any any better.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
So.
Now, let's lets move on with the with the progress report for the various people.
<another_language/>
So [PERSON2] is maybe on the call, but it doesn't work or him.
And then he is working on the analyses of IW SLT.
And, yes.
So that's that's it.
There is.
That's a lot of work to be done.
[PERSON6] is working on the preparation.
The [PROJECT6] wrapper, wh wha so so far you have not used [PROJECT6] wrapper and you are starting only now? 
Is that correct?
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> 
This weekend I integrated it and I'm using it from Monday.
Whatever test we have done until now from Monday.
(PERSON12) Mhm. Okay.
(PERSON5) [PERSON12]. 
(PERSON12) Yep.
Sorry could you-
I think because I spoke with [PERSON2] maybe if you can't you know if you can't you know.
Make a-
(PERSON12) Look at this email-.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON2) No, no,no, no.
Maybe if you can give the de the details of this task you want, maybe [PERSON2] can contribute also.
Because he has some times this week, based on what we have spoke before.
But he-.
Because I I think you should just inform him about what you want exactly about this.
(PERSON12) Yeah, thanks. 
So I'm I'm.
So we have like three halve or quater persons yeah who who we could ask.
Thank you.
(PERSON5) Yes. 
Okay, okay.
So just-.
(PERSON12) Yeah. Thank you.
So the the [PROJECT6] wrapper is now in as part of the demos, part of tests, right?
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah.
(PERSON12) And the [PROJECT2] model? 
So the delay has been fixed, right?
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've I've tested it also.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
 So which-.
(PERSON5) Ca ca can I just ask.
Is it is it completely fixed or is there some some small still some small delay?
Or is it completely-.
(PERSON6) So, I have not run kind of like a regress tests.
It was like maybe 2 or 5 to 7 minutes minutes of read recordings it played and it was pretty fine. 
And I could observe a significant im improvement <unintelligible/>
(PERSON12) Le let me make a wo big warning again.
We have now replaced a critical part of infrastructure, the [PROJECT6] cache with [PROJECT6] worker.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON12) Which behaves differently and also the [PROJECT6] model going from [PERSON13]'s to [PERSON4], right? 
So you are now using [PERSON13]'s or [PERSON4]'s set up.
(PERSON6) I have both of them.
<parallel_talk> Which is.</parallel_talk>
I have both of them right now.
(PERSON12) And we have no idea which one of them is better.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON12) And both of them are new.
So it's, that -
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> so basically I'll tell you that in terms of like-
So basically both are like fast on ss same levels.
But the quality?
I cannot judge the quality.
So someone has to do this.
(PERSON12) Yeah. Yeah.
(PERSON1) From the submission it looked like [PERSON13]'s model was better.
(PERSON12) From what submission? The IW SLT?
(PERSON1) Yeah.
(PERSON12) But that was tested only on the Dev set, right?
(PERSON1) I think so, yeah.
(PERSON12) So, maybe I'm thinking what would be the best task-
Would be the IW SLT test set indeed and everybody should translate the IW SLT test set with their models.
So someone should do it with the [PERSON13] ones.
But we did we have this, right?
So so we need only like a preliminary number from [PERSON2], right?
(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(PERSON12) Plain translation but the problem is that this this involves also the ASR set up.
And we want to just assess the quality of the [PROJECT6] system alone.
And we have not fed the true correct transcripts to the [PROJECT6] systems, have we?
We have not, right?
(PERSON5) For some of them, yes.
I think for all of-.
(PERSON12) I think none none of the systems has access to to that.
Yeah.
So the task is is now, yeah, there is there is some to do.
For a few people.
So that's like to do for the demo.
So that would be [PERSON6] to fi or so [PERSON2] to share with everyone the true transcripts of English IW SLT test set.
[PERSON6] to feed this through [PERSON13]'s model.
[PERSON4] to feed this through his model.
[PERSON2] to evaluate it, right?
(PERSON6) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON12) In the terms of ble only.
(PERSON2) We have it, so-.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So could this, could this be done today or tomorrow?
(PERSON6) Yeah.
 I I can use [PERSON11]'s scripts which he used for IW SLT.
And it it depends on how, how many files do we have.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
It's not too many files.
It's-.
And it should be actually the [ORGANIZATION9] files and then the [ORGANIZATION2] is not that interesting.
Well, maybe to concatenating all?
What about concatenating all?
Yeah. 
And then we can split it afterwards.
Concatenate it for [PROJECT6] systems and split again before evaluation, right?
(PERSON5) You mean the voices, [PERSON12]?
(PERSON12) Yeah, yeah.
The transcripts.
(PERSON5) Transcripts only.
(PERSON12) So the number of lines is fixed. 
It's only the ble evaluation.
Yeah, so only ble scores.
So the number of lines needs to be preserved.
(PERSON6) I have I have like <unintelligible/>
Which is like a quick to fix the Friday deadline.
So [PERSON7] said that she can review the Romanian transcripts.
If if if we generate the transcripts of any video and an we can give her.
So, what I say is that we give the Romanian transcripts generated from the  [PERSON4]'s model and from [PERSON13]'s model and that [PERSON7] decide which which one is better.
(PERSON12) Is better.
Yes.
<laugh/>
(PERSON6) Because we want to be sure of Romanian at least.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So here, here is the requirements.
Common constraints, preserve number of lines, translate form English into Czech, German, Romanian.
So manual check by [PERSON7] and-.
Sorry a second.
<another_language/>
Okay, so-
Manual check by [PERSON7].
And what else can we do with the list?
Do we-?
We are going also from German into English, right?
(PERSON6) Yeah, so right now I am using that [PROJECT5] workers and that was crushing today.
(PERSON12) And why [PROJECT5] workers?
Are they the best ones?
Because [ORGANIZATION7] has this World War II bomb, right?
<laugh/>
Yeah, they had World War II bombs found in their office so they have barred people from entering.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
(PERSON6)  And it happens to be that that very office is very close to the server room where all the all the [PROJECT4] systems or records are.
(PERSON12) So in the-
To to make life easier in 3 or 4 upcoming days to make life easier, they are going to diffuse the World War II bomb found during reconstruction and they must not enter their building, so-
<laugh/>
And they also had some hard drive failure again so they lost some files as well.
So this is like-.
Yeah.
(PERSON6) Yeah. 
Everything crushing at once.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
<laugh/>
Yeah, exactly.
So.
So please [PERSON2] concatenate all for [PROJECT6] systems.
Transcripts of English and also German as the-.
And we also want Czech actually because we also have one system for Czech.
Yeah, we want everything.
So we want translates from German into English, translate also from Czech into English.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so we basically-.
(PERSON12) Yeah, and then we will-..
(PERSON6) Yeah, please please.
(PERSON12) Yeah, so so [PERSON5] please ask [PERSON2] to concatenate all the files in a parallel fashion and send and or provide 3 files to [PERSON4] and [PERSON6].
One will be English, another one will be German and another one will be Czech.
And all these 3 should be translated by all the systems.
(PERSON5) And then [PERSON2] can evaluate them.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
(PERSON5) This. 
So you need, okay, 2 files.
One for all the <unintelligible/> and for all test sets, yes?
(PERSON12) For all test sets toge together, yeah.
(PERSON5) Yes, Okay.
(PERSON12) The whole IW SLT test set.
(PERSON5) Okay, okay, so-.
Maybe he is listening to us, but I think-.
(PERSON12) Yes, please double check.
Yeah.
So this this should be done today.
And today it should be translated with the existing systems.
From English into Czech, German and Romanian.
From German to English and from Czech to English.
And then we will thrust the pivoting.
(PERSON5) Okay, yes.
Just, who can-.
Who should receive these files?
(PERSON12) [PERSON6] and [PERSON4].
(PERSON5) [PERSON6] and [PERSON4], okay.
(PERSON12) Okay, great.
And then we have [PERSON9] and [PERSON9] says that there is test data for almost-.
So, let's let's move on to [PERSON9].
[PERSON9] are you on the call?
(PERSON9) Yes, yes I am on the call.
(PERSON12) Yeah, okay, so you could help us equally.
Test data almost finished for 40 languages.
Let's do this comparison as well.
So, let's do it only for the English to-..
(PERSON5) I just, [PERSON12].
(PERSON12) Yes.
(PERSON5) I leave a call because I have a call and I want to answer the phone.
Can I leave the call now?
(PERSON12) Yes, yes, yes.
Than you. I think we have discussed everything.
Thanks.
(PERSON5) Yes, ok.
Thank you.
Bye.
Goodbye everybody.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So [PERSON9] you should do the same thing as [PERSON2] should do.
Only going from English to the many languages.
So, please have a look at your [PROJECT4] test set that you are putting together.
Concatenate all the English files in a way in which you can easily break it up back again.
(PERSON9) Mhm.
(PERSON12) And then provide this long English file to [PERSON4] and to [PERSON6] and they should translate into all the languages that you have.
So, what what is the set of languages that you have?
So the-.
In your email-.
So, so the, please concatenate all the English files in reversible way, so that you can easily break it up again.
And send to [PERSON4] and [PERSON6], uh, sorry [PERSON6].
So this file concatenated file, the names of languages where you have the target side.
So this will surely be Belarusian <laugh/> and or whatever you have.
(PERSON9) Yes, sure.
(PERSON12)  And into all these in-.
(PERSON9) All those files are not validated. 
Only 4 languages are validated by the annotators.
So.
(PERSON12) Yes.
Are are the files at lest parallel?
(PERSON9) Yes.
But, I am not sure because yeah some sal some files have 1 sentences and some files has 2 has 2 sentences in the target and source side.
So.
<unintelligible/>
So that's a problem maybe.
So that's the reason I co discussed on Friday if we can assign-.
(PERSON12) Let's preserve the line for line convention.
(PERSON9) Okay.
Okay.
(PERSON12) Let's not care if there is more sentences on one line.
Some of the systems will survive that and produce more lines, more sentences.
But they must always produce the same number of lines.
So it is critical that the number of lines remains correct.
(PERSON9) Okay.
(PERSON12) So [PERSON6] ant [PERSON4], can you make sure that this holds?
(PERSON6) Yeah.
This is focus, this will be the focus after after Friday right I do it.
(PERSON12) I wanted this to be-.
To help us to decide which system to use.
But you're right that it's safe to give this task only to [PERSON4] and not to you, because you need to debug the pipelines.
(PERSON6) Yes, because you wouldn't want to risk the whole system.
(PERSON12) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, and [PERSON4] you have never run anything through mediator or have you?
(PERSON2) I have but I don't know what to run and uh-, uh-.
Yeah, maybe it won't be-.
Just.
I I think that it would be just simpler to just do like a visual test.
Like, like have the have them in the on the website.
Like like in two columns and someone who knows the language would just see directly.
I think that-.
(PERSON12) It's not that simple anyway.
<laugh/>
Because it's like circulating 40 emails to 40 people.
It <laugh/> and asking for their judgement.
(PERSON2) Okay, okay. Sorry.
I I meant like for Romanian or or something.
Okay. So.
(PERSON12) Okay.
For Romanian, we'll do this for Romanian. 
(PERSON2) Okay.
(PERSON9) I think we have Romanian already evaluated in different <unintelligible/>
Maybe I need to check.
(PERSON12) Yeah. Okay.
(PERSON9) I have a Spanish, Spanish and Spanish data.
(PERSON12) So anyway, [PERSON9] please make sure that your, that you have as many languages parallel.
Like line for line.
That the number of lines matches and concatenate the English side and send it to [PERSON4] and [PERSON6].
(PERSON9) Okay.
(PERSON12) And also let me know where the references are.
And be ready to receive the translations in all the many languages.
And if we succeed, if [PERSON6] succeeds, then we will give it to you and you will score it
with against the references.
(PERSON9) Okay, sure.
(PERSON12) So, actually none of these test sets are multi-parallel, correct?
(PERSON9) Uh, some we have 22 languages, not only 20, 22 languages have multiple multilingual parallel <unintelligible/>.
Like [ORGANIZATION5] and [ORGANIZATION3] data is equally parallel but equal translation so we can use this data.
(PERSON12) And it is ar all committed in the properly committed in the directory, right?
In the [PROJECT4] test set.
Or is it still floating around somewhere?
(PERSON9) Yes.
[ORGANIZATION5] data is already uploaded on the data in the [PROJECT4] test set.
And I think, uh, if I'm correctly reme if I remember correctly so Polish and some Spanish and Cata Catalan is already uploaded on [PROJECT4] but some languages are n are not uploaded.
So I will upload maybe tonight or tomorrow.
(PERSON12) Not maybe but for sure and do it within an hour, okay?
<laugh/>
Within an hour after the call.
And I'll I'll have a look and you-.
So so the assignment holds but there is a pre-requisite, before concatenating the files, put everything into the repository.
And then do the concatenation.
Essentially, send us the command line that does the proper concatenation.
So that we we will do the the clone get clone and we will concatenate it ourselves.
And send us both, the output of the concatenation and the command line to run.
And we will compare whether we got the same thing.
Okay?
(PERSON9) Okay.
(PERSON12) So test data.
Please concatenate so actually it's-.
So please, there is one thing, uh, uh, make sure to have all current test sets components.
Current test sets components pushed to [PROJECT4] test set repo.
Send us the command to concatenate the English sides and send us also the output 
<other_noise/> of the concatenation.
Yeah.
And that's so that we can compare.
So that we can double check we got the same thing.
The-.
Yeah.
Reversible way.
Yep, yep, yep.
So this is all.
This all has to be.
This all has to be done in a reversible way and sent to [PERSON4] and [PERSON6], right.
(PERSON9) Okay.
Please, if you just really coul could make it as simple as possible for me because I really really-.
I'm trying to do all the those stuff at once, so-.
(PERSON12) Yeah. 
So for [PERSON4] it is a-
It should be one plain text file in English from [PERSON9] that should be translated into all the languages in your model.
And for [PERSON4] it should be 3 input files from [PERSON2].
One in English, that needs to go to all the languages but we need Czech, German and Romanian.
One in German that needs to go in English.
(PERSON9) Mhm.
(PERSON12) And one in Czech that needs to go to English.
And this is it.
So it should be 4 files for [PERSON4], right?
(PERSON9) Okay. Okay.
(PERSON6) German to English?
What what model is it?
What model are we using?
(PERSON12) Well, [PERSON4] has a German to English model as well.
It is multi, it's English to many and many to English.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON2) Yeah.
(PERSON6) So English is the pivot language, okay, okay.
(PERSON12) Yeah. Yeah.
(PERSON2) Okay. Okay. That is fine. Okay.
(PERSON12) So [PERSON6]. 
For [PERSON6] it should be these same 4 input files but [PERSON6] should run on for now only for those files from [PERSON2] and not fight with the with the with the [PERSON9] file yet.
And I will try to help with that.
(PERSON6) Okay.
(PERSON12) Yeah. Okay.
(PERSON6) And update with the Czech segmenter is that so I observed that the Czech segmenter is segmenting-.
Sorry.
The number of segments in the okay <unintelligible/>.
Okay, so I manually.
I segmented and punctuated a I'm lost.
So I punctuated and segmented and punctuated a transcript using my segmenter which has also been also punctuated manually by you.
It was one of your [ORGANIZATION1] lectures back in back in back in months.
And it has more segments than  a manually <parallel_talk> That's good.</parallel_talk> devised transcript.
(PERSON12) That's better.
(PERSON6) Yeah.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So you have this new version and that that seems to have a higher recall than even the manual one.
Or whatever.
Okay?
(PERSON6) So I I I I have no nothing as of like <parallel_talk> Numbers. </parallel_talk> experimental data which says it has a more recall than a manually devised transcript.
Kind of.
<parallel_talk> But you.</parallel_talk>
But I I visually I visuall I visually observed this.
<unintelligible/>
(PERSON12) Yeah, that's better.
(PERSON6) So, this that's better, yeah.
(PERSON12) Mhm, okay.
So, let's let's quickly finish the the rest of [PERSON9]'s contribution.
I'll be finished, hoping to be finished tomorrow. 
Promised this Sunday to finish it today, but unfortunately it didn't happen.
Yeah.
Cross examination of annotated data sets.
So this is now going to happen very quickly in this test concatenation.
Yeah, and we we still-.
Yeah, I need to revise the emails.
But the demo for the Project Officer is now little bit more urg urgent.
Yeah, building the test, filling the rest of the test data.
Assigned tests to annotators for evaluation.
Start preparing synthetic data.
Yes.
Yep.
Okay. That's good.
And [PERSON4] worked on the performance fixes.
And now will translate the the 4 files.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think, I think that's it for today.
We'll be kicked in a minute, I guess.
(PERSON6) Yeah. Yeah.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
So thanks everybody for participation.
and [PERSON1] we may ask you for some assistance later on, when we decide.
and I need to wait until my daughter comes so I'll come to the office only later.
So [PERSON6] until when are you in the office?
(PERSON6) Maybe 7 or 8.
(PERSON12) Yeah.
