Like, there are already a chain of emails.(PERSON2) Yes, yes, he is writing a lot of emails today.<laugh>
(PERSON3) Oh, okay okay, okay.(PERSON2) He was just was a way for the for for Christmas holidays now.(PERSON3) Uh, yeah can you, can you drop [PERSON1] your message over the phone that we are already online.(PERSON1) So, uh, I'm I'm happy to see you.Is, uh-
Are others also joining, or you don't know yet?(PERSON1) Yeah, okay, yeah.So you are, you are the-
(PERSON3) For others you mean-
Yeah, uh.(PERSON3) On our regular calls, yeah, it is [PERSON4].Uh, uh, and I don't know if you have highlighted the portions of the document with the colourful papers.(PERSON3) Oh, I-.<laugh>
(PERSON1) And, uh, uh, then I I'm really worried about [PERSON5] if he can actually help us or not.Like, I think he might have started some PhD somewhere or or whatever.(PERSON3) Yes, he was about to move to Canada I think.(PERSON2) Uh, he sent me a list of named entities.And now after this Christmas holiday, during the holidays I didn't address him but now I see that he is not going to finish it because he stopped.(PERSON1) But, but, but-
Well, finish-.Who, who-
(PERSON2) Annotator has stopped.(PERSON1) Annotator stopped, okay, yeah, so, uh, so if you, see, if it is an online document-
If you see that the annotator has stopped-.I've <unintelligible> to him and it's an online document so I see that he didn't do it.(PERSON1) Okay, so, that is good that you can finish it yourself, so, please do so.And, then, um, uh, get in touch with [PERSON5] and double check that he would be able, uh, to do the processing, uh,  also at the token level.And, uh, we need to do the second round for many of the words, uh, the annotators-
You and the annotator should have indicated, that it depends on the context.And for these context dependent, uh,-
(PERSON2) Uh-, I don't understand at all what you are talking about.(PERSON1) Yeah, so this is something, that I wanted to also-
(PERSON2) <laugh> write it down.So, I will not be able to transfer all this information to [PERSON5].(PERSON2) Uh, um, we can write it to the agenda if we can find it.(PERSON1) We can actually put it to the to the master plan, uh for the-
Um, um first shared task on automated minuting.Timeline, so we could put it into the shared task components, or we could put it to your agenda, whatever you like better.(PERSON3) So, uh, [PERSON2]- the ma-
The agenda is in the master document so if you can check the Coffee Meetings.(PERSON2) Uh, uh, uh, okay so I've forwarded it now to-
(PERSON3) Okay.(PERSON1) Yes, yeah.(PERSON2) So five-
<unintelligible>
(PERSON1) 0 eight- 
So I thought, I know that I have discussed this with [PERSON5].But if he is not responding, then, like we have to-
(PERSON3) Is-
(PERSON1)  Recreate it, uh, ourselves.(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll write the <unintelligible> here.Uh, so collect, uh, candidates for, uh, <unintelligible>
Annotate at word type level.This is in full documents if, uh, that particular instance is an NE is not ,uh,  an NE, and then insert token level annotations again into the same xml [PROJECT2] documents.Uh, the documents will, um, contain information like, uh, this word was once, uh, was suspected to be an NE, but at the the words type, uh, annotation it was, uh, marked, uh, as a regular word.Uh, this word was suspected NE marked clearly as an NE in word type annotation.Uh, not processed at token level yet, and then, uh, marked as an E at token level, right?So this is not complete, but it illustrates that we want to have the, uh, uh, the finest possible detail about the annotation process.<laugh>
(PERSON1) Yeah.<laugh>
So, but, but [PERSON3] have you read the process?(PERSON1) <laugh>
Yeah, okay.Uh, to the uh, annotation maybe a rename that document, so it should not be a copy of-.But  we can rename it.(PERSON2) He, he asked me to make a copy of his document not to delete the lists so so-.(PERSON1) But yeah, yeah, uh, I, I just would like the name to be more descriptive for someone so it-.But it has to, uh, be this this copy of that is, is, like, just an automatic what uh, what, happens, if if you make a copy, uh, okay.(PERSON1) Proper nouns and personal copy of [PERSON2] or whatever.That's-
Like the word copy is good but this copy od is just automatic what, uh, what that happens if you make a copy.(PERSON1) Okay, well, so the idea, uh, is, uh, at the end we need to have the full collection of all our documents with all named entities replaced by place holders.So the process of the named entity removal has to be very clean, and we have to know at what stage of this process we are.The hard part are the entities which, uh, uh, like are normal names or project names or words, which can be names and may not be names at times.Um, uh, so that's why I suggested to proceed at the two levels, first at the word type level, and then at the word token level.(PERSON2) Maybe I don't understand this entire world type level.So a word type is the word as it appears in the dictionary.And word token is a particular instance of the word in a running text in in the running text.(PERSON2) And after that, we will once more do something with contexts.But some words like Jan or some clear names like it would be totally a waste of time to to do them a token by token, so we can do these words all at once.So that's, professor <unintelligible> mentioned that the word type
(PERSON2) Yes, yes.(PERSON1) and word token in in one of the early seminars.<laugh>
(PERSON2) That's.To do like the bulk processing of the documents and the insertion of the annotations into the Xml and things like that.So that is some programmer's skill that-
If if [PERSON5] is is not available, that will be like seriously in need off.(PERSON1) No, no ,no ,no, no.(PERSON1) So that is not a-
(PERSON2) Yeah, okay.(PERSON1) That's  not a problem like, uh, you have, uh, what you are doing is, is, the, manual, decisions, that's the value.(PERSON1) Uh, like then, uh, creating such a list again, uh, it is very easy.In most cases in in ninety nine percent of cases these tokens, the particular things that you have in the list, they will appear in the list for everyone, whoever does it.(PERSON2) I'm getting into the list so [ORGANIZATION4] once written with M once written with N, once written with MN and so on.once written with-
(PERSON1) Mhm.(PERSON2) <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Remember-.Yeah, so this is, the the typos in named entities are mainly because the people do, the annotators not knowing the correct spelling.So I'm just saying that when I'm looking through the list there are a lot of different words, really.(PERSON1) Yes, that's because there was, uh, probably beginnings of sentences.So all of, uh, the words at the beginning of sentences, uh, also got into the list.I think that [PERSON5] did not use name tag because he needed to collect this list quicker.(PERSON1)  Uh, the, uh, the, student, uh, Martin, uh, Mare≈°.He used name tag so there is, uh, quite a big chance that if Martin creates this list, it would be shorter.(PERSON1) The multi word ones are also a problem.So, if you have World War II, you, you, you will have three words and and, well-.Uh, this I'll say stages and then-
Uh, after that, uh, un-, uh, or remaining or open problems.Open problems, uh, and one  of the open problems is the edition of new documents.(PERSON2) <unintelligible>
I'm not really sure that he has included all the all this stuff in.Yeah, uh and uh, what I want to say, as the last stage is, uh, the actual deno-.Well, actually there need not be a replacement, but like the, like, the actual actual removal of the original text, uh, from the documents.(PERSON1) And what is an unresolved problem as the identity of NEs, um, preservation and now well-.But we do want to ideally we do want to keep that this was like Jane and Peter.Here was a project name and don't make it explicit, whether it was the same project or a different project.So there there will be a lot of gaps in this type of output, but I think it's for the sake of time.Uh, for the sake of time, we can probably afford to, uh, drop, uh, order to to ignore ignore tracing of these chains for projects.For for speakers like, uh, as, uh, utterance labels, uh, bu- f- and persons-
I think that-
Persons, uh-
Well, I do not-
Um but we should not ignore it for speakers, ah, in both, uh, cases.When they, uh, appear, uh, as utterance labels and, uh, when they are referred to in the text.If the annotators already  de-identified, they didn't know who is who so the labels can be A, B, C and so on.And within in the text it will never be the same C, it will be varied.(PERSON1) Yeah, that's okay.I don't think that the data set for the purposes of summarization will suffer much if we if we-.(PERSON1) We might afford tracing, uh, other people who are only mentioned, uh, in the, uh, in the ext and uh, not, uh, taking part in the meeting.Jane is not not a speaker in this meeting, and someone refers to Jane at the top of the meeting, and someone else refers to Jane at the end of the meetings.(PERSON1) Well, if we don't, we don't never mind.Because actually, if the labels of-
(PERSON1) Yes, if the labels are  A, B, C, that is what you said.And I'm happy to do errors in the second part, but I would be very unhappy to do errors in the first part.(PERSON1) And person frame,
Yes, so get in touch with [PERSON5] and check if this is what was discussed with him.Um, so please get in touch with him and extract from him the information if if he can do this for us.And in that case, that probably falls on [PERSON3] for the programmer parts, I'm I'm afraid.So that means that you may need to offload some of your , uh, the what- modelling ideas or to [PERSON4].If I could lock myself in a sanctuary for a week, then I think I will have anonymised the corpus myself.(PERSON3) Yeah, I think I think like I'm not, uh, like certain minutings are still not clear to me.(PERSON1) So what I'm thinking of is, for example, for the token level annotation.If if if I locked myself for that week, it would be a few via macros, and I would be just hitting
F one, F two, F one, F two, F one, F two.And it would be done for a document like very quickly.So, it is, uh, I  I 'm, not so much worried.Uh, but it has to be a skilled person in in this, ah, like text processing.(PERSON1) Plea-, please do plan something-.(PERSON2) Well, [PERSON7] is working on our de-identification from the beginning of January or?(PERSON2) And she has time and she -
(PERSON1) Uh, well she will have to make the time for that.But I, I could-
(PERSON2)  So she has to say, if we have to delete also the names of languages.(PERSON2) Leave English, German, Czech and don't mix it up.(PERSON2) On the same way, so that we-
(PERSON1) Exactly the same way.(PERSON1) So a document is either the transcript or any any minute version for that particular meeting.(PERSON1) So document is any text, uh, in the collection that is very important.So this should be done especially on the [PROJECT1] data, right?(PERSON3) Yeah, okay.(PERSON1) So, back to [PERSON7].And we will then check if the procedure that we are already running is in line with that or if anything else needs to be included in the procedure.(PERSON1) Yes, I agree that these are not personal, uh, uh, data.(PERSON1) Yeah, so, so that's the guidelines.Please [PERSON2] agree on a timeline, exactly.And there will as last resort, there could be like a secondary or tertiary or or final annotation stage.Where we would be still removing something which, like, we 
haven't thought of and [PERSON7] has found it out.And then, the other thing that [PERSON2] needs to discuss with [PERSON7], uh, is the consent forms.(PERSON1) Uh, I sent an email to her this morning mentioning these two things.So, so  we've discussed this before.(PERSON2) Because I have also shown her many times this consent forms.(PERSON2) So it means that we should kind of forget everything that we did before and do again from the ze-, from zero.The first constant form created, which agrees with, uh, kind of working with our data.And then, uh, create a second consent form.(PERSON2)  And give all the participants of all meetings, both consent forms of the same 
time at the same time.(PERSON2) We do, because we have we have we have-
(PERSON1) Yeah.(PERSON2) Kind of, our consent form.(PERSON1) Yeah, that's that's the problem.Uh, uh, we are processing their data without having recived their consent.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) 
And-.So I would now, with [PERSON7], I would focus on the second form which is the consent to publish the data.So he should not be able to, l uh, uh, like feel identified.And trying to get more people, provide us with meetings, and there and there we will need the the first form.And the first one will be on the content to process the data and deidentify it with the forcing goal of publication.(PERSON2) Mhm well, I'm just thinking about this, uh, samples.If-
Uh, so with um kind of preli-, openly said, if we really need all these samples for people we are sure about, like you and me, [PERSON3] and so on.(PERSON1) We can simplify it also by, uh, like giving everybody the full dataset.(PERSON2) So really should prepare the special examples for every consent for every participants.And I -
(PERSON1) Um, well, no.It is a little bit of programming and a little bit of evidence, like, who was in meeting of what?(PERSON2) Yes but neither me nor [PERSON7] will never do that.I understand, that there is, uh, there could be, uh, a substantial amount of administration so to say.(PERSON1) Uh, so I think this is like a pre-release of the corpus.Uh, it is a matter of like a putting it in a directory, wrapping it in a Html uh, or, or,  
, uh, any any browsable format.(PERSON1) What is what is the the tedious part is ,uh, the ,uh, the linking which 
person was mentioned where.(PERSON2) Yes, this is what I'm asking about.(PERSON1) Uh, this should be, uh, I hope that this is in your directory structure 
somewhere.(PERSON2)  Uh, to make it manually it is a very big task.(PERSON2) What I it can probably automatically extract is from is to extract the names
of participants from meeting minutes.Oh, I forgot to record this meeting, is that a problem?<laugh>
(PERSON2) No, you are recording it.And with the consent form sent to Jane or Mary we will say: "Based on our records you were a participant of this and this meeting.(PERSON3) I think we can-,
Uh, what we can do is, like we create a master sheet.(PERSON3) Please, please see, uh, <unintelligible> and check.Yeah, I don't think the the stay-, the extra step of cutting out the extra portion of the master sheet is too tedious.I will leave it up to you what do you find, uh, like the the balance between your labour and and their labour.(PERSON3) Yeah, so once we have, once we have the meeting IDs and these are the partcipants so like, uh, we can easily find to which ID belongs which participant.And when we, uh, know that people will be again opening these files, every gaze to that It's crowd-
It's like, it's crowd sourcing essentially.We will see, maybe there will be no more, uh, outstanding pieces of information that need to be deleted, but maybe they will.And then we will do like a second pass of the data.(PERSON3) Yes, so I think uh what you are suggesting [PERSON1] is like  instead of the master sheet, we could-
We keep one master sheet, but we keep well from the masters.We create the individualized sheets-
(PERSON1) <unintelligible>
(PERSON3) And they will have the remarks.(PERSON1) That is like a purpose-
They will have remarks, they will have, they would have the remarks.We should have a sample document, uh, one meeting or two meetings at most.Ideally, uh, at the end of January.So that we can put it online as to the prospective participants of the task at the beginning of February.(PERSON1) And we need to have the full thing, was it end of March?(PERSON3) A trial data is16 March but training data first April.(PERSON1) Probably, yeah.(PERSON1) End end of February would be a good date for the participants, for the meeting participants, to uh, to get their consents, right?<laugh>
(PERSON3) <laugh>
Yeah, so the data de-identification consent from their end should be done by, uh, February end.(PERSON1) Uh, no was the-.So if we are able to have the data for them by mid February, then I would agree with you.I think that we will have the data at the end of February, and they should then do the consent.Uh, in the first week of February, or something like that?First week of March.And so so talking about the timeline, what should be the time in line for this total task.(PERSON1) Yeah, well it depends on whether we have [PERSON5] or not.But I think that [PERSON2] will be finished with the work type level annotation, uh, well, in 
two days.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) So it is.(PERSON2) So it's it doesn't take-
It's like thousand and a half maybe.Uh, uh, the Xml mark up to to find, uh, uh, uh to extract the token level instances, um?This should happen, uh, by the end of by the mid of February at the latest.Uh, uh-
(PERSON2) No, it's just in the agenda document I didn't see that.Okay, now-
(PERSON1) Yeah.(PERSON1) Just just like, close your eyes for that.<unintelligible>
<laugh>
(PERSON3) Okay, so I will, I will increase the timer.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
Probably, yeah.(PERSON2) And maybe one will thing, as you created the Scientific Committee.So actually, I'm not sure should be in the Scientific Committee.(PERSON3)  If they are participating, so they could also be the potential reviewer.So that is why I have forwarded you the email, right [PERSON2].So I am kind of unsure of if we should invite all of these people to the Scientific Committee.And somebody of them have some Google, some Google, [ORGANIZATION6]'s or something.(PERSON1) Well I would suggest [PERSON3] that you put this list down and you would just put to be determined or in preparation.In the in the Scientific Committee.(PERSON1) Is it in the C, F, P, uh.(PERSON3) I guess I, I emailed you like, maybe in December.(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, that is my fault.Does the document with the C, F, P.
Could we use the same document for, uh, editing the text of that, uh, email?(PERSON1) Okay, yes, oh, sorry.Okay, so please put all the candidates, uh, from the web page to this list and, uh, fill what you-.Uh or let's let's let's call it Scientific Committee, right?I'm now on the [ORGANIZATION6]Sheet, uh, that you will created.So [PERSON3] I have now added column F in the [ORGANIZATION6]sheet.So let's, let's in this [ORGANIZATION6]document, with the invitation email.Make several copies, uh, uh, individualized in in various ways, and I will contact some, and you will contact some and [PERSON2] will contact the Russian ones.(PERSON1) Yeah, that's, uh, we really have to do it, uh, today, right?(PERSON1) Need to, uh, have this information in ten days?(PERSON3) No, I I I would propose that we submit the proposal within the January seventh or eight.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) Oh, okay.[PERSON1] we have to just submit the proposal because a scientific committee is not, will be fixed.(PERSON1) Well, there are people from a list.From [ORGANIZATION10] I don't expect anyone to be in any good position for, uh, serving on this.<laugh>
(PERSON3) So, uh, so, uh, [PERSON1] can you just, uh, uh, tell me the names?(PERSON1) Put them, or put all of them there, and I will delete the lines, or like cancel 
them like strike them out.(PERSON1) And you can also suggest some more people like you would you would want to write.So I will propose that at least if we can have fifteen people, fifteen people, that would be great.In a Scientific Committee.So I suggest that for the sake of time, let's finish the call now.(PERSON2) This [PERSON9], I have written to you.(PERSON2) Yeah, just the short questions.(PERSON1) No, I I I haven't seen her answer.(PERSON1) Yeah, exactly.(PERSON2) Ah, okay, okay, mhm.So yeah we will do it -
Let's do it later when she replies.(PERSON3) Uh, so ,uh, another thing [PERSON1], just to I would be adding you to the [PROJECT3] repo for this.(PERSON3) Yeah, uh, it would be great if we could have one.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) So, obviously we have to ask the old dinosaur well, not dinosaur, but the experienced people from the 2006, or what was that instance, the the AMI corpus?(PERSON1) And I'm happy to ask them also with the, uh, with  request of being on the committee, we should ask these two questions for these three persons.And then, uh, I would ask Ian <unintelligible> if he would either himself be, uh, like agree or have someone else to to suggest.(PERSON3) Yeah, okay, that would be great.(PERSON3) We can delay these <unintelligible>
So let's start writing the emails, uh, two prospective people here.<unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.(PERSON3) So, so the plan is like we will do it latest by 10th.I I will also-
(PERSON1) Not today, like, yeah.(PERSON2) I will I will come to [ORGANIZATION3] at Thursday.(PERSON2) And and I will also write [PERSON7].(PERSON1) Remotely, that's okay.Please [PERSON1], [PERSON1], could you please i will send yu the three prepared letters.(PERSON2) So, I think it would be better if you send it.Just for them to feel better to be on the <unintelligible> Committee.(PERSON2) Just to <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Okay, I can do it.I thought it would be better from you because, you know them, but never mind.(PERSON2) I also can send it, but if you send it it is.like from higher.9A) I have privilege because they have points  for cooperating with foreigners and I'm not a foreigner enough.(PERSON2) So, it's really a financial question.So if they get an email from [PERSON2] Nedoluzhko, it's too Russian.(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) Bojar doesn't sound?<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
Everybody knows, everybody knows that I am Russian.So it will be better if they will cooperate with you than with me from the financial point of view.And and you can at at the same time you can actually word it in Russian because I can validate whether you are saying good things or bad things.(PERSON2) I I think it's be better, I think it's better in English.<unintelligible>
(PERSON1) Yes, of course.(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) I'm, I'm just telling you that like I I can validate Russian.No, let's say it in English, I think it's better in English.(PERSON1) Okay, let's let's do it this afternoon.
