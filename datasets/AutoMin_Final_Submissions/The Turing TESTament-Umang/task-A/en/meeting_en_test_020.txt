(PERSON2) Hi, [PERSON1].(PERSON1) Hmm, mmm, mmm, today, I am in the office today.I'm in the office.<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) Is [PERSON3] joining us?(PERSON2) Yeah, I was just going to message him that <unintelligible> are we meeting today or not?(PERSON1) And by the way did you do [PERSON6], the annotator?(PERSON1) Uh, uh, [PERSON3] was supposed to do here on Friday.Aha, I actually should ask [PERSON3] about it.(PERSON2)  He usually joins, uh-.(PERSON1) Hi.(PERSON2) Yeah.(PERSON2) Yes, I am so <unintelligible> you are usually there on time.If everything is fine and you are joining or not.(PERSON3) Oh no, everything is fine.Looks like we have to like replan everything now.(PERSON3)  So the thing is that we are not going for special sessions, right?I think [PERSON1] can translate that for us.(PERSON1) Uh-huh that Czech text you mean.And, um, thank you for the email, uh, we had a te-, tech- a technical communication meeting.And uh, the results are the following: that their are papers for for special sessions, uh, should  
fill the same criteria as all other papers and the same timelines.Uh, if you plan to make a special challenge session, you should, uh, just follow these rules.Uh, you should do what you want just coordinate it with something like <unintelligible> two more  
higher.Un, ah, ah important bit is that uh, the uh, the articles are not in the proceedings of  
[ORGANIZATION4].(PERSON2) So I think the same, uh, was written by [PERSON4] as well.So this is usually for some full fledged workshop.Uh, not really for shared tasks, which are very focused.But, uh, like this gives us much more flexibility and freedom to choose our event, or also like  
accept papers.Ah, but the thing is that we have to do much like almost double work with this.(PERSON2) So that means it is going to be,uh, like we are going to, uh, handle the track alone, right, is 
it?Is it so, or did I said yes?Did I understood everything?So program committee, key note speakers everything we have to choose, okay?And, uh, then, like, uh, [ORGANIZATION4], will only be there.They will just promote our, uh, workshop in their webpage and nothing else.(PERSON3) Yes.(PERSON2) Uh, for a satellite.Yeah, yeah, yeah.(PERSON1) [PERSON3] may ask you, do you want to do that?(PERSON3) Yeah, um, we don't have any option right now.I forgot [ORGANIZATION11] or not [ORGANIZATION11], something different.(PERSON3) [ORGANIZATION5].(PERSON1) And why not to do a shared task at [ORGANIZATION5].(PERSON3) I would propose both, [PERSON1].If we do not get in [ORGANIZATION5] like, do we have some other option as well after [ORGANIZATION5]
(PERSON3) We have to go on trying, we have to go for [ORGANIZATION10].Ah, [ORGANIZATION10] spoken language technology workshop.But I 'm strongly feeling from, uh, like whatever [PERSON4] said that our, uh, work is not exactly in  
the domain of speech, it is [PROJECT1].So, uh, so, because there is nothing like no concept of speech here.But the thing is that the proposal for a [ORGANIZATION16] workshop this year is over.So, uh, [PERSON1] what I would propose is.Like, um, eventually we have to try and see.Uh, like, uh, it's better that if we get either of the two, um, [ORGANIZATION5] or [ORGANIZATION4].Because both of them are well recognized in the community and our.(PERSON3) The only the only <unintelligible> that I'm finding now is, going with [ORGANIZATION4] is like they 
will not allow us a space in the proceedings, which may, uh, deter some of the participants.Like, um, like, I am not sure that how much, how much they will be excited to publish a paper in  
[PROJECT2] or [ORGANIZATION9] is a big no.What I can understand is the last time that that differ-.The like, uh, time periods between proposals, submission and your, uh, final paper submission was  
five months.But this time it is only three months, so uh.(PERSON1) Uh, may I just make here one more thing.So they are supposed suppose during this three months to, uh, write a program.So to make, uh, this, uh, minuting somehow.(PERSON3) Mhm, mhm.Uh, if you are if your proposal is accepted for a workshop, uh, then we have much more independence 
than special session.But for the special session, we have to strictly follow whatever [ORGANIZATION4] says there.(PERSON2) Ah, one more thing, uh, which is coming to my mind is.If we have to prepare, like, in three months, like, like all the, if you are just emailing all the  
participants to take part into it.<parallel_speech> They are supposed to prepare <unintelligible> <\parallel_speech
(PERSON3) Yes, I think, like, in three months our data will be prepared.Like the proposal submission, the last date of submission, submitting the proposal is February  
twenty eight.And before that, we have to get an ISC endorsement that the speech community is endorsing our  
proposals.So by March fifteen, we know that whether we are, we are accepted in [ORGANIZATION4] workshops.But before submitting the proposal, uh, we have to get everything ready, like the website uh our  
program committee, key notes, the program, everything.And then only, uh, we have to make a full fledged, uh, proposal for like workshop program and then  
submit.(PERSON2) So so but when is, when is the date, uh, for submitting the full papers to participants.(PERSON1) We can set it up.(PERSON1) Up to us.(PERSON2) Okay.(PERSON1) I will be back in two minutes.<other_noise>
(PERSON3) So it should be very much double work.(PERSON2) So, uh, right now, is the deadline the same?No, for the satellite event it is February twenty eight.One is endorsement from [ORGANIZATION12] and when [ORGANIZATION12] endorses we have to, uh, submit.(PERSON3) Submit and then they will say.So it is a long process now.(PERSON2) And so anyway, we have prepared the, uh, this document.(PERSON1) If they accept us both to [ORGANIZATION5] and uh, uh, this [ORGANIZATION4].(PERSON3) [ORGANIZATION4].(PERSON2) <laugh>
Yeah.(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON3) Yeah, see, eventually it will be online.Just, uh, like we have to manage this submission and do our thing.So, I think that better, [PERSON4] will, uh, will have a better say.Because both have a very good visibility.(PERSON1) Yes, but ,uh, can we find so many participants.(PERSON3) I think so.(PERSON1) Yeah, okay, okay.Because, uh, since it would be entirely on to us, we don't need twelve submission.(PERSON3) Like, I have seen workshops in [ORGANIZATION6] having two or three submissions only.(PERSON1) So, [PERSON3] you are here to go to both.And to begin with, uh, workshop now.(PERSON3) Yes, yeah, but it, but it means double work.(PERSON1) Yes I understand, but you are very good.(PERSON3) <laugh>
(PERSON1) <laugh>
My response.<laugh>
(PERSON3) <laugh> Oh, okay.(PERSON3) I talked to him, and there was some things <unintelligible>, <laugh>.(PERSON3) <laugh>
Yeah, okay, uh.For like, for um like, for all of us, to submit to the [ORGANIZATION12] workshop administration portal.So for this, [PERSON1], I shou- I should contact [PERSON4] right?(PERSON1)  I missed the point.(PERSON3)  So we, we have to take a membership to submit the proposal.(PERSON1) I do not know, really.[PERSON3] don't don't ask me about these administrative plants.(PERSON3) Okay, no, I'm just asking, suppose [PERSON1] where, we have to pay some fees somewhere for our  
workshop.(PERSON1) Yes, aha, [PERSON4] and he will forward you to [PERSON5].(PERSON3) Uh, okay, okay, I got it.So we have to pay two forty Euros for institutional membership, maybe.(PERSON1) Yeah, yes, I think it's not a problem at all.But, uh, ask ask, uh, [PERSON4].(PERSON1) Um, um, no, I don't know what.(PERSON3) Okay, so let me prepare this as part of the content that is required.I have to study some, uh, other satellite events that I got accepted to an [ORGANIZATION4] last year.And the, uh, the additional thing we have to have to do [ORGANIZATION13] management, uh and um,
[ORGANIZATION13] management and especially we have to invite the program committee now.And to make a website for our propo-, uh, for our shared task.Interesting..
(PERSON1) Yeah, it is really big work all of it.(PERSON3) And and, uh, another thing, uh, [PERSON1] so ,uh, can you tell us a bit more about [ORGANIZATION8]?(PERSON1) Hm, I would.I would rather advise you to [ORGANIZATION7]it.I do not know, um, much more.(PERSON1)  I 'm not really interested in all these points.So I probably published there something once or twice.But ,uh, I didn't make a  a reche-, a research about ,um-, what is-.Probably there is some points, I don't know which points.(PERSON1) Either [ORGANIZATION7]it  or ask [PERSON4].(PERSON3) Yeah, I got it.(PERSON3) Um-hum, okay.So [PERSON4] is the technical editor, so it makes sense.(PERSON1) Yeah, probably.Yeah, I'm very, very anti-organisational type.(PERSON2) Which journal?(PERSON3) The [ORGANIZATION8].(PERSON2) Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, mhm.(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, actually.Ah, very good papers.(PERSON2) Yeah, yeah.(PERSON3) So do you think that like, uh, the participants would be interested, uh, for a publication in  
this, in this journal?(PERSON3) Oh, because I have never heard of it.I know I have, uh, in in like in my, uh, research duration.(PERSON3) I think it will be mostly focused on machine translation.(PERSON2) That is why I think I have experience with it.(PERSON3) But it is very old.(PERSON2) Yes, actually the like.Um, like all the statistical machine translation, all the paper.So, I read lots of those papers.(PERSON2) I think it was indexed, uh, in like all [ORGANIZATION7] and all that.But let us give it some <unintelligible>
(PERSON3) Okay.(PERSON2) I think editorial board members are really, uh, interesting to see.<unintelligible>
<laugh>
(PERSON3) Mhm, so anyway.So I think, uh, this would be easy for us, like if we have to do [ORGANIZATION8].Uh um-hum.(PERSON2) Yeah, even if you see to the website of it.They have mentioned that machine translation corpus linguist [PERSON7] morphology, syntax and  
semantics is what-.(PERSON3) But I 'm trying to look at the where it is indexed.Because, you know, like, uh, to a new person, um, they would probably go for where it is indexed.So one good thing for, uh, going for <unintelligible> and would be,  uh, if we go for  
<unintelligible> , uh, the proceedings would be indexed with [ORGANIZATION6] anthology.(PERSON2) Um, that is a good.That is a good positive point.(PERSON1) I would say that the <unintelligible> is better than [ORGANIZATION4] workshop.(PERSON3) Yeah, less work.(PERSON1) This is a little less work and intent and more intensive output.(PERSON3) Yes, I agree.(PERSON2) Yeah, [ORGANIZATION7] I have seen.It is already, uh, written in there.(PERSON2) Yeah, and it will be like <unintelligible>.(PERSON3) But I don't see any kind of like proceedings in this journal.(PERSON2) Uh, proceedings.(PERSON3) Proceedings of any workshop or something, it was not there.(PERSON2) Yes, yes, yes, yes.Yes, any kind-.In any kind of conference or workshop, yes yes.But I think if we are to do it [PERSON4] will take care of that.(PERSON3) Yes, he says, that either either we can go for [ORGANIZATION9] or we can go for [ORGANIZATION8].So, but [ORGANIZATION9] is is no, because, yeah, it.(PERSON2) So I think, uh, [ORGANIZATION8] is very famous to the entire machine translation community at least.(PERSON2) Yeah, so ,uh, not aware of the other summarisation and all people.Uh I, uh, uh, I kn- I know something called, uh, [PROJECT3] from [ORGANIZATION15].Oh, for that, like a what they have, the general specific journals.<uninteligible>
Like applied science and something there are after a certain there is specific something.I'm talking about [PROJECT3] [ORGANIZATION15], [PROJECT3] conference proceedings from [ORGANIZATION15].(PERSON3) Yeah, <unintelligible> they will be indexed in <unintelligible>, [ORGANIZATION7], all the major  
industry services.Okay, maybe we can ask [PERSON4] I think about this.(PERSON3) Yeah, let me let me scan it to-.(PERSON2) It was [ORGANIZATION14] indexed, I guess.(PERSON3) [ORGANIZATION14] yes, it will definitely will be because it is from [ORGANIZATION15].But I think it would also be indexed in others like <unintelligible> or something.Um-hum like, if I would have been so, I would have actually preferred a [PROJECT4] over [PROJECT3].(PERSON2)  Because I have read actually like four papers.(PERSON3) Of [PROJECT4] okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.(PERSON2) The quality of paper is very good, which I've have read.(PERSON2) Yes.(PERSON3) Oh, okay, mhm.<other_noise>
(PERSON2) And [PROJECT4] is also an open index.(PERSON2) Yeah, open access.And, uh, it is uh indexed by <unintelligible>
Directly <unintelligible>
(PERSON3) Mhm, okay, uh, you checked it?(PERSON2) Yes, I checked it from the website of that.(PERSON3)  Mhm.(PERSON2) That can be one, uh, positive point about it that it is open access.So another thing, another thing that we can do-.Um, but I have to ask like we can, uh, uh, we can also do it as part of the <unintelligible> forum.Oh, so <unintelligible> forum has  a very big visibility among the IRN and [PROJECT1] community.I think it was mostly the proposal, right?So we have to revise this and list down the thing that we need to do for, uh, the satellite event.Then, uh, do we meet tomorrow then?Uh, maybe by tomorrow, I can come up with something that what are the additional works, we need to  
do.[PERSON3] thank you very much for willing to do that.Uh, I am sorry that I can't help you on this stage so I really, I have been-.(PERSON3) No, no, it's absolutely okay [PERSON1].(PERSON1) I will -
I would be really glat to help in some contextual things I will really-.I will be glad to read the proposal and to, uh, to write some chapters to the proposal, so-.(PERSON1) I think it i quite, yeah-.(PERSON3) [PERSON1], your your input is absolutely necessary at every point.The only thing is, we have to do double work, ah, that is the thing.Ah <laugh> otherwise, everything is fine.(PERSON1) Yes, yes, unfortunately, it is double work.(PERSON3) You too, you too.(PERSON1) Thank you.
