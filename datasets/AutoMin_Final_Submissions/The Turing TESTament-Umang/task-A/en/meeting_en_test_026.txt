(PERSON1) Yeah, that's good.So I'm curious, if [PERSON4] is here, we don't have [PERSON4].(PERSON3) So basically, I'm a bit, I get stuck with those experiments, because I had notable problems with how to run it at all with explayable mistakes.(PERSON3) And uh currently I'm I started running those experiments that [PERSON2] told me a while ago.(PERSON3) To run the same set up [PERSON2] ran for that test part on other parts .(PERSON2) Yeah, it is it is to complete the GPU test and and to know that one version, one new version of [PROJECT3] really, really works.(PERSON2) So after we done this, then we will know which version of [PROJECT3] we will for the use.Okay, ah, so you are doing it in FP 16, in the half precision, right?(PERSON1) Okay, that run on tesla GPU use, ah, for a comparison.Um, I'm a little worried about the multi source status for the deliverable.And this is also a question on [PERSON2].(PERSON2) Then, then I only need to finish the executive summary.(PERSON1) An an overall, does it look reasonable, or are we uh do we have a problem uh with not enough progress in multi-source?(PERSON1) Yes, okay, that's good.(PERSON1) We could have done the multi-source research also in the text domain.So that's, ah, the one of the reviewers in in the review also ask whether we are, ah, combining, ah, the ah, the document level aspect with the multilingual aspect.You, [PERSON2] played with the Window, ah, approach.(PERSON1) And then it was the the experiment by [PERSON16], which are covered there wheter like small data only and your monkey only.(PERSON2) Yeah, we can use the text from [ORGANIZATION3].So, I I really think that some experiments with multi-source text, ah, in [ORGANIZATION3] should be done immediately after -.(PERSON1) Or actually concurrently with what [PERSON3] is doing at the moment, right?(PERSON2) But I've, I suppose, that text multi-source is not a challenge.(PERSON1) So so sorry, what you are, you're saying that there is no gain to be expected, ah, from multi-source, right?So, so [PERSON3], I think we need to have a separate call with you and [PERSON2].So to say what you are working on at the at this moment and what else you you could start to experiment with the multi-source.(PERSON1) Just say something, so whatever two, two pm or three pm?(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, that's fine for me.Well, I'll send a link, ah, later.But ah, I'll definitely plan it to the <unintelligible> calendar, ah, for you.Ah, and, ah, the one of the biggest thing is that [PERSON10] is leaving, which is listed at the end of the, at the end of the, of the notes for today's call uh.So, [PERSON10] is already hopefully in touch with, uh, everybody, uh, who is getting some of the [PERSON10]'s original tasks, uh.So, uh, [PERSON10] himself will finish the language model checking of ASR outputs.So then we would have a monitor, live monitoring of whether the ASR is producing something sensible or whether something is terribly wrong.And with [PERSON17] and [PERSON4], [PERSON10] will synchronize about the tools that, ah, that [PERSON10] has developed.I've seen [PERSON17] here and he disappeared at the moment.(PERSON4) Uh, not exactly but I'll probably be in touch with [PERSON10] or some sometimes early next week.So I was confused because [PERSON10] said that he could be late for the call and that's probably happening.Then, ah, if the other [PERSON11], who is on the call, ah, can you hear us?Yeah, so I've, have started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you have reminded [PERSON4] that your, ah, profanity filtering is not yet integrated.And, ah, I think this is also an important message for [PERSON17] who has disappear again from the call.So the the important message is that, yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated and everybody should do so.So [PERSON4], when working with [PERSON17] and when, when, ah, like documenting what the set ups are, ah, make sure that it is tested well enough by colleagues such as [PERSON11], or then even [PERSON10] for the language model checks us and and everybody else.Ah, ah, ah, like ah, using MPlayer, or whatever simply play them, follow the sound output on your machine and and see how how that works.Like it's important to first debugg it using the lock files, and then it's important to debugg it in the pipeline.Here, in this case, [PERSON11], it would be most efficient for for all of us.So, so, [PERSON4], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do it yourself integration.Also, I have a call with [PERSON11] later today.(PERSON4) So, we will discussed exactly <unintelligible> with [PERSON11] <unintelligible>  that we have that and if he couldn't <unintelligible> the local copy on his laptop because <unintelligible>.So he also has a chance to use X2Go.(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, that that's also uh very well.We have seen during the last sessions that the new ASR, the end to end ASR, E2E ASR, also suffers from the spasm issues.(PERSON1) They're already in the ASR language.Already the English contains contain suddenly something like uh, oh, oh, oh and there were full stop after every Oh.So it was actually for a second, [PERSON2] saw that I think, for a second ah, the ah the incoming, ah, sentences were like flooded with lots of oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.Ah, so, ah, I I don't think we need to fold proprietors spasm removal, because if we remove the the one from the ASR itself.(PERSON4) Nothing is getting past to that MT worker, so -.(PERSON1) Yeah, but the MT worker can create its own spasm for good ASR.Yeah, you are, ah, ah, so [PERSON4], you have the call with, ah, [PERSON10] later today.Ah, so, ah, that that would be on the dashboard and the monitor.Then another thing that [PERSON10] is passing over to others is the [PROJECT2] check ASR.And [PERSON6], ah, will will get this from him so that we have, ah, so repeat has [PROJECT2] baseline for his own experiments, right?(PERSON4) Oh, I haven't plan the call with [PERSON10].(PERSON4) As MT <unintelligible> profanity filtering.So, when you have a call with [PERSON10], then [PERSON10] has already started, ah, preparing for the upcoming Monday seminar that's going to be given by ,ah, Italian guy, a famous one, the author of [PROJECT4], actually.So [PERSON10] has probably started, but he should walk you through that thing.Ah, so the English, which is robust to the various speakers.So, ah, on Monday we will hear the Italian English and yesterday, ah, we had a chance to hear the Japanese English and the ASR was really struggling with that.(PERSON4) Ah, can I <unintelligible>  I can that the accented English one to caught -.Ah, I mean, I really like to see how it plays out.So, [PERSON6], please include [PERSON4] in this part as well.So for that, I think that [PERSON6] [PERSON6] is now mentioning in in his report here.(PERSON6) I mean they're cutting the recordings to words and done getting together to to create a new, new, new recordings with, ah, different sentences.The current idea that that better is is working on is that he will create new sentences by concatenating words that were spoken in other sentences.So, it will be really multi speaker, ah, sentences and, ah, therefore, the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved.Ah, so the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences.And, ah, we are going to create new sentences by from text only language model by adding the the sound part to that.(PERSON6) If I'm, I'm not su- sure how they apply it.But um, I think that the pipeline, um, the training pipeline, um, which is used for training of the <unintelligible> that uses this same technique.So that is, ah, that was the, ah, like news and and work that is being put on you, because [PERSON10] will be leaving.And another, ah, like a long term, or as well as a short term pile of work has arrived, because of the two sessions that we had.So, I would really like to ask everybody to record the experience from the [ORGANIZATION7], and as the one sessions.Also the there is one more lesson that we have like harshly learned yesterday, when

[PERSON4] was still in in hospital waiting for the covid test or something like that.So, so, we still are totally relying on one person who is able to start the pipeline, and that is a bad situation.So, ah, [PERSON4], this is this is mainly on you and also on [PERSON5] and and [PERSON17].To, ah, like make sure that the whole set up is understandable and regularly tested by others in the team.Then it was restarted by [PERSON9] Williams, ah, in Edinburgh.And, [PERSON4] and [PERSON5] please be in touch with [PERSON17] and propose some solution.So, I actually, I have a call just and while, um, I saw word checks e-mail regarding the girls -.(PERSON5) That he got rolled in the pipe and and I kind of had a ah talk, ah, call with him right at the moment, when I was free.(PERSON1) So, ah, obviously he didn't know enough about the architectures.So [PERSON5], you were during that time you're in some different lecture or, ah, because at some point I suddenly saw that like [PERSON17] stopped trying, maybe.And I was spending him through the pipelines that escaped like, what does each block, what exactly does and how to debugg?Now you are getting this errors how to debugg what what section is exactly the hair issue with so first tribe with the ASR of then try with the <unintelligible> itself, try individual ASR <unintelligible> and things like that.But yeah, because it would not be a surprise if [PERSON17] failed, because he was time for the first time.(PERSON5) Yeah, the the pipeline is pretty complicated for someone who has seen it for the first time too.(PERSON1) Yeah, but I was surprised that like the pipeline, because it was the same pipeline that the pipeline -.(PERSON5) No, the fingerprint was still the same, but the worker was not running.(PERSON1) But when the workers started running, it it didn't work.You know, I mean a bad thing that, ah, if we want to implement [PERSON14]'s worker, we we need to have a separate separate descript.Ah, so please, you three, make a call pre- like set up a call with [PERSON17].Ah, it's a pity he he is not here at the moment.Ah, because [PERSON17] is now, ah, after his experience, ah, he is working on on like, ah, how to make the configuration cleaner.So, next week, I would like to hear from you three how far you got in the in the like specifications of the requirements.[PERSON1] asks [PERSON17], [PERSON5] and [PERSON4] to have a call and provide the first specification of requirements, uh, for a pipeline set ups.Ah, EG easy to integrate, ah, also the profanity filtering.(PERSON5) [PERSON8], ah, I also like to I also like to request you.So you have multiple scripts that start the um that starts you avanti and workers, which is like a multi-edr and multi bigger and multied relevant.So maybe if you could remove these scripts which have the similar performance, or only leave that which which is usable and which is kind of okay for the for our life sessions.Oh, actually, workers for the English to Czech model.I mean, it's up to us, we can control how many languages we want to see the subtitling subtitling platform.But if you think that when starting the worker, if you limit the parameters, if you limit the number of languages there itself.When we were testing a reef [PERSON5], when we were testing it on -.[PERSON11] at a performance stable constructed with the [PERSON9]'s rainbow worker and [PERSON14]'s rainbow worker.And comparatively, ah, [PERSON9]'s rainbow worker were a better, were better side.(PERSON1) So then the, there is actually no point in having [PERSON8] rainbow worker in the pipeline at the moment, right?(PERSON5) But, but -.(PERSON5) If, well, for a fall back solution, it's important like uh remember during the [ORGANIZATION7].(PERSON8) Yeah, but still, basically, yeah, yeah, there are still basically like two things that that are bad with the model.One thing is that it wasn't train trained with the fine tunings that feel used, such as using partial sentences and other stuff.(PERSON5) Ah, maybe this is a stupid idea.But what I think is that if we could have like multiple word, multiple, multiple replicas of your same workers, and, each emitting, a different subset of languages.Like, I don't see that because it should be paralyzing when your -.(PERSON8) Yes, so there are maybe like forty languages, so so there are forty, like the big size is forty.(PERSON8) And for back size for it, it is actually a lot slower than for back size eight, for example.(PERSON8) So maybe like for a better solution.(PERSON1) Still, I think that -.(PERSON8) Use [PROJECT3], yeah.(PERSON1) So I suggest that we do not use [PERSON8] tensor to tensor worker at all for the live sessions.Ah, as the fall back solution, we should have the [PROJECT3] models running as a worker on our side.So, we should be able to launch rainbow worker from [PERSON9] on our cluster.(PERSON4) Yeah, for that uh, I think I located the directory on uh.(PERSON4) Yes, yeah, I'm going to look into it.(PERSON1) Get in touch get in touch with [PERSON3] and others.So actually all of you I suggest that all of you are on the devel at [ORGANIZATION1] mailing list.But this is so like low level issues, that it's worth having this discussion in the devel at [ORGANIZATION1] mailing list.(PERSON8) I think that I'm not either, but also, I am using the newest version of [PROJECT3] actually to train the shortening models.(PERSON5) So actually, when I was working with with [PROJECT3] I had several like part conflicts.There were like chain of parts with which needed to be which needed to be fixed, and kind of unable to backtrack each each of them.Yeah, so I, I, I never tried it, then.(PERSON8) Do you mean path configs like, like, work paths for the [PROJECT3] itself, or for the or in the model config.(PERSON2) If if you talk about learning [PERSON9]'s model then [PERSON9] send us some scripts with absolute paths on their systems, and we just need to replace them with our paths, correctly.(PERSON8) Yeah, I can also try this if you send me the location of the models.(PERSON5) Yeah, it's the subject is UEDIN rainbow audience.But, ah, ah, let me send you again with the part of the -.(PERSON1) So, so, use whatever a communication platform works for you.Remember to that [PERSON3] is also a source of information, because [PERSON3] will now be fighting with that.And he'll be running into the same issues, and and he has successfully fight it with [PROJECT3] in the summer.So let's let's use, ah, [PROJECT1] dash [ORGANIZATION1], also for the technical technical issues.And so I already have the first models, but now I'm trying to vary the amount of data and the length in the dataset, and to see, like, what is the difference in performance and and length.And then when I'm happy with this, then I will get to the second phase, where I will basically translate and and synte- and creating to dig data from the rest of the and the end dataset, and then I will build like the final shortening model.So, here I I actually run into one issue that basically I'm running out of storage quota -.(PERSON1) So, so you just need to come up with a reasonable estimate how much more you need.(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, oh.And also, yeah, also, this is the problem with the [ORGANIZATION4]s one hundred language models, because they they take like fifty gigabytes themselves.(PERSON1) To IT EDU <unintelligible>.(PERSON8) And do you, maybe know, ah, like, how how much space there is available on Troja because maybe I could save something there.And actually, it's since the better GPUs are on Troja.(PERSON2) You can use Command DF and it will tell you the the space on all the disk.(PERSON6) There is a command to check the quota.(PERSON1) So in the, I'll check what is called, yeah.(PERSON1) Oh, that's a different quota.Opt and a few tils?Okay, so on Troja I have fifty gigabytes.So, ah, is there anyone who should report some progress, and we have forgotten about him.(PERSON8) And basically, ah, [PERSON23] would like to <unintelligible>.Tomorrow afternoon, before the call that I have with [PERSON3] and [PERSON2], like tomorrow at two.(PERSON1) So try, yeah, try that, because I'll have called at half past three with Dominic and and [PERSON3].(PERSON5) Also [PERSON1] and there is a guy here in, uh, in Zabrican.(PERSON5) He is an Indian guy and saw the data, it's his name and he mentioned that, uh, he is actually interested to join your group, your team.Maybe it's a PSD or do that at full time job.(PERSON1) It's a briefly the one.So uh he should check uh it's something like [ORGANIZATION1] slash PHD -.(PERSON1) And he should email uh that he is interested uh, uh, to send to PHD at [ORGANIZATION1] and something like that.(PERSON5) But, he expressed his interest to join your group and he also mentioned that he had a discussion with you.I don't know about something during our debruity,

(PERSON1) Yeah, Buffalo, I don't remember so his name.So for PHD application, he should email that email PHD at [ORGANIZATION1].And, ah, I'm beyond my capacity, but others may have the capacity and for the general connection with [PROJECT1].So I'm for tommorow at two I'm trying to send a [ORGANIZATION6] invite.So, I'm now highlighting the experience, ah, from the [ORGANIZATION7] and as you want again.Ah, yes, we absolutely need the evaluation of all systems, all files, ah, in the test set.Ah, like, ah, ah, ah, in, [PROJECT1] test set automated.<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, it's okay.Pretty <unintelligible> strange but having made.(PERSON1) Oh, okay, so you're really like caught in the in the hospital, right?(PERSON1) <laugh>

(PERSON4) Eh, but, I was raised like very late in the night around nine, nine thirty Indian time.So I have a call at two thirty Prague time with [PERSON11] to discuss some of the specifics of that is around the SLTS capability of downloading files.(PERSON1) Yeah, and we have [PERSON7] on the call.So, [PERSON7] will be the person who will pick this up from you.(PERSON1) So are you also planning [PERSON7] to be on that call with [PERSON11], or with with the [PERSON4] after that?(PERSON4) I think I'll have a call with [PERSON7] later.So what essentially my script will be doing is taking an input of taking the index file as an input and it will generate the ASR from whatever model there is mentioned in the script.And I'm trying to make it as as well as possible, so that we don't need to hardcore the ASR in the script.So, after that I'll have a call with [PERSON7] to discuss all the, oh, things that I put in the script, and then I think he can take it up from that.And [PERSON7]s know, [PERSON7] knows where these things should be stored.Then, without running anything, you should just be able to look at the the stored outputs and the store scores, and it would immediately see where we are standing.So, [PERSON4], let me know when you finish it, and we can arrange a meeting, and then I will look at it, and then I will write it into the deliverable.(PERSON4) I think I will have I'll have call with you next week on my  <unintelligible>.Okay, so that that that was the the first immediate lesson and to do that that arose from the last week sessions.So, when there is some session happening, we really need to make sure that we have the important people around the globe, ah, ah, like available.During the, ah, the call at three pm Prague time the two to UTC call.Again we we were like chasing [PERSON9] through a [PERSON13] on on [PROJECT5].So, ah, for this we we need to know which components we are using and who are the people behind these components.So that's is like, ah, a message for me but also for for [PERSON4].Ah, as a fallback solution, if I if I forget to to make sure that we have these people available, or they do not know that they won't be available.And I would like to put your names next to those for your, to know that like you are the people who are long term, including this goal and this, ah, ah, this challenge in in your plans.And here the person is [PERSON6] and possibly [PERSON4] to a little extent, right?(PERSON1) Anyone else, anyone else can work on on the non native accent think.Ok, then, another thing that I spotted is this is in the Monday test document.So there is, there is a certain like skill, ah, behind that, that needs to be practiced.And whenever I see you any any of you doing that, then I, like, always have tips in my head that what could be done faster.If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation the data crunching please, ah, say so.So, my impression, ah, from the, ah, domain adaptation that [PERSON10] has been carefully doing for all the sessions, was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR.But I would like to see the the benefit of of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT2] set up.So, maybe [PERSON10] and [PERSON4] because he is learning how to do domain adaptation.If you three could, ah, meet and double check what is [PROJECT2] doing with the -.And the substitute words are for the language model are are really used, and it's asking the correct anagrams with the substitute words instead of the the new words.I think so because, I think so, because we had, we were testing it with a non domain adapted model -.(PERSON1) Yeah, so if you have this great experience then, then maybe I'm wrong.(PERSON1) So the, for example, in [PROJECT1] test set there is this Monday talk of mine.But our models, I'm not sure if we have the domain rapid model for that or not.So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time.And when we see a keyword in the domain adapted version then we would then we would like use that sentence from [PROJECT2], which is in general worse, but contents the right terms.And and another suggestion is that we really should have our arm fully new ASR and do various experiments on fine tuning and and and all that.And, [PERSON6], is there any update from the potential, ah, ah, colleague or friend of yours.(PERSON1) Yeah, so, if there would be anyone else, ah, would be curious about this, please let me know.So this is something which is, which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet.(PERSON8) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about, like, what kinds of data we currently use for this.Because, ah, because, for example, ah, like, if you check, like, [ORGANIZATION6]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things.Be- because, because you have like a such a large, uh, set of of videos that that basically with with different domains and and different speaker and speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5].(PERSON8) And and like, I had this idea that we could just like, ah, use some tool to the download basically these some kinds of filter and videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make your training tests, ah, ah, a training set out of them.So, [PERSON8] proposal, ah, the scrape [ORGANIZATION5] and even automatic -.So if you, ah, if you are, ah, are in touch with someone such as [PERSON6] is in touch with someone.(PERSON8) Yeah, it's just an idea.<laugh>

(PERSON1) It is so little chance here a little chance [PERSON6]'s, ah, friend, ah, will help with this.And I've recorded them either in the Monday seminar document or maybe here in the [ORGANIZATION7] as you want.There was a debate whether languages, ah, are the African languages will be supported by some of the European project.And the answer from the project, ah, coordinator was that, well, we were discussing this a lot.So even the word disgusting, which is not a bad word on his own, is very risky.So, ah, we should, ah, our our profanity filtering should really be, ah, aggressive about about any slightly negative words.Because I'm afraid that we cannot just aggressively removed these words, because there are many words that actually might harm someone, and and especially these days.But maybe we, we could employ um these neural networks that I forget how this this task is called, but it's like based on the movie review -.Well, maybe we can use some sentiment analysis to to remove, um, sentences or or some a group of words with a negative sentiment.Because ultimately, uh I mean, that s uh kind of of very specific to a use case.So not exactly similar, but when I was working with the financial dataset that we had created, or in my previous work, so uh we were looking for things uh from, let's say, an investor's point of view, it was since it is related to sentiment analysis.So, even if you train a neural network model to a spot some, some of the things that might be disrespectful or um demeaning to someone, or maybe that that shouldn't be there.So uh it takes a lot of work, it will probably take a lot of work.(PERSON6) And maybe maybe there are al- already some, some datasets, because, um, if I remember correctly.I'm the the the social media like [ORGANIZATION4] or or or um or [ORGANIZATION8] etcetera they, they actually use such things to filter the the posts.There was actually a cable competition for this, where people had to make models to detect the tweets or like sentences which were harmful in some ways.Then you will have a question fire that can classify basically this sentence is like hateful or like, there are, there are like five categories like fake news, hateful and I don't know like what.(PERSON1) Yeah, but remember that our setting is slightly different from these competitions and also the yeah -.The, the, the difference is that we do not expect the speakers to use this abusive language, or whatever you call that.And I think that with in this different setting, the the problem with the subjectivity that [PERSON4] mentioned and I agree it's very important, but it may be less, ah, less severe.(PERSON8) But also, if we detect, detect something using this, this model, then we can know that <cought> that there was a potentially,

(PERSON4) Actually, I think it would make the task much easier, because since we are not expecting anything bad.But, ah, yeah, if it if it seems hateful in gender, we just remove it.So in in other words, the ASR should make a different hypothesis.Ah, I mean, we can just say in the profanity filter part, they can just look out for a hateful comments or or hateful sentence, and we can simply remove it.(PERSON4) It will be like a sentence was said.It's not irritated actually transcribed, we will have it in our logs, but it won't be displayed on the subtitling platforms.(PERSON1) Yeah, so I see that as a great option for someone who would like to supervise a student.So it could be whatever [PERSON2] or [PERSON6], or [PERSON8], I don't know if you have any any stu-.We could also then employ them easier because they're, they will be Czech citizens.(PERSON6) Well, maybe maybe I can ask my student, because we haven't agreed on the bachelors thesis.(PERSON1) I think he should stay with the non native English accent.So so we see, and again, like a good space for, um, ah, for research.So for that task of, ah, can I ask the elderly students who are already in Prague for the first or second year.If they are interested in doing that then, maybe since they will already be in Prague.(PERSON1) Okay, well, so thanks a lot for your time.If you, I would still I like to ask you, please read the experience of others, record your experience from the most recent sessions.I'm happy to see that actually we have covered by someone, to some extent, the- these topics that I've found.Okay, as well, other than like saying that my visa is a <unintelligible> probably be in Prague in January.So we will have one more this call next week, and then, ah, it will be already the Christmas Day and then, um, the the New Year's Eve.So, two weeks of of of a break from these Thursday calls.
