(PERSON4) Is, is not a problem, the, the, but only that the righ-, right (tester) speakers like, eh -

(PERSON7) Well, it's not a problem now but it we like want to screen a film or something -

(PERSON4) Yeah.(PERSON7) I donít know, but -

But on Thursday and Friday I officially have a vacation.I could do it on Friday but -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I -

Yeah, it, it can be, it can be done on Monday or -

Because I, I told [PERSON8], [PERSON8] set a deadline for us, for this, for today.(PERSON6) <?another_language?>

(PERSON4) <?another_language?>

(PERSON6) Part-time employment?Um, yeah, first I, I, I would like to thank [PERSON6], um, that he submitted the (camera diversion), [PROJECT3].Um, then, um, I plan to write like official email to [PERSON9] that we want to, that we want to have a book, publish a book and, um -

In the instructions on the web is that we should, we should send him a table of content at least.OK.

<laugh>

(PERSON7) Table of contents.<laugh>

(PERSON4) So the version on the web like the, have you pulled and make - the la-

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.But I think it is, this is ready for [PERSON9] so that he can, he can start searching for reviewers or -

(PERSON3) Hm.<other_noise>

Yeah, only maybe, maybe in, in chapter 6 we should, we should change some of the sections -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) Yeah, conclusion, conclusions, and conclusion of six, chapter six, um -

(PERSON6) Yeah, itís just lorem ipsum.<laugh>

(PERSON4) So, yeah, we still donít know whether to restructure it somewhere to have only one chapter -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) Like conclusion as a chapter or conclusion as a section only.(PERSON4) So please, please bear in mind that I will send it or I, I will send you an email notification that I am sending it but please.(PERSON4) So I would like you to focus everybody to only on the book b-, because then, then in a, in July I suppose will be many holidays or I donít know.(PERSON3) By the way thereís a (callish), thereís a (callish) <unintelligible> calling deadline which is, which is on July the first.So, I, I, I will rewrite the paper to [PROJECT11], to the deadline at the end of June.(PERSON4) So maybe at -

It's updated in the Wiki we will see.(PERSON7) OK, like -

Yeah, somebody just like -

(PERSON6) Sometimes itís crossed out.(PERSON7) Cross out (calling) and didnít write new date in -

<laugh>

And then thereís Black box in July.(PERSON7) Anyway, doesnít really matter I plan to be here anyway but -

Yeah, thatís, thatís good because I want to send something and, and I havenít written anything yet and Iím writing the book so -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I suppose that we, we will send some, some of the papers to Black box because, yeah.So -

(PERSON4) If it is not accepted to [PROJECT4], [PROJECT4], I suppose that our paper with [PERSON7] we sent to Black box.(PERSON7) Iím looking there, OK.

(PERSON6) <unintelligible>.I plan to be here in July -

(PERSON4) So -

(PERSON7) And probably like half of August.And Iím taking vacation this week from Thursday to Friday and next week on Wednesday.So, we can, we can have a meeting on July thirteen, fourteenth.So, before the ⁄VAL, [ORGANIZATION2] beer I would, I would -

(PERSON6) Yeah, so -

(PERSON4) Be the meeting.<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, so letís have a meeting.You can wri-

Yeah, because we donít have a calen-, set calendar yet, so -

(PERSON6) Hm.Then we could have a meeting on, um -

Iíll be here the, like, the um, one to - the first, to fifth, um, no.(PERSON3) And, and what, what about a regular meetings on Tuesdays?(PERSON7) OK.

(PERSON6) And then, there will be -

So, the third, the next week of, of -

So, the first week of July there is no meeting or?(PERSON4) Thirtieth we will do have a meeting and the next week I am not here.So, if it is a three, there is a meeting.(PERSON4) Iím not sure whether I'll be here -

Yeah, you are -

Yeah, you are going to <unintelligible>.Because for example the first or the second, second week I am not -

(PERSON1) Yeah, but -

(PERSON4) I am not -

I will be offline to <unintelligible>.(PERSON1) OK.

(PERSON4) So, so I think -

(PERSON1) OK.

Thirteenth.So, I, I -

So, [PERSON3], you, you plan to submit a paper to calling.(PERSON3) Well, it, it, it doesnít, does not depend entirely on me but I think the results is that, that we have now wonít lead into something publishable in two weeks.The official deadline for, for the book was the end of June but I think now that itís ñ 

Um, we will not make it so, um.But I, I think that it can be postponed, um, like the, the -

All the outcomes of this grant can be post-, postponed from, from the end of December to the end of January.(PERSON4) Not because of corona crisis but I, I can ask when I, when I sell the, um, the -

<?another_language?>

The final report.Maybe it can but I, I,I donít like to like postpone it much because anyway if we postpone it we will not write so -

(PERSON3) Sure.So, um, June, June thirty, stop -

(PERSON7) Um, actually it says here that we say I donít know whether we have to prove it somehow or whatever that we werenít able to -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I know.(PERSON6) So for some conferences that happen in the first half of 2021 we could still use the money from the project?<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, but -

Yeah, but you know.(PERSON6) I we have leftover money so it would be away but -

(PERSON7) Then again it would be better not to ask too early because then we would postpone the deadlines and -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) Um, but anyway thi-

Um, you can for, um ñ

You didnít, um, without the corona crisis than we could, we could postpone it like, um, to the 31st, um, 31st of January like.(PERSON7) Yeah, but if we ask for the Covid nineteen postpone then we could use the money.[PERSON13], [PERSON13], [PERSON13] told me that she will study it and she will -

(PERSON6) Um.<laugh>

(PERSON4) Like the [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION1] and GAUP lady.Um, [PERSON1] send me the, um, the visualisations of the [PROJECT2] metrices and types for the [PROJECT2] and I, I also know that if I, if -

Because I generated the, the metrices from the, um, um, [PROJECT9], um -

(PERSON3) Hm.(PERSON4) Machine translation and the, like the heat maps were, were very sharp but I know if someone else generates something very similar the heat maps are ñ

Donít need to be as sharp as, as, um, of neural setting.If I donít know what, in what it was but if you set something differently, some parameter of, um, of the neural machine translation training then the heat maps -

(PERSON3) Hm.(PERSON4) So you think itís -

Because what, what I, um, um, observed in [LOCATION1] but they didnít use, um, they use, um, like, um, [PROJECT6], I think.(PERSON4) But I know that there are many other settings that theyíre completely different, different balustrade but not, not balustrades but they are really, um, um, the balustrades are not as, not as visible as in our settings there.So, so, now I donít know because in my chapter I just, Iím comparing the, um, [PROJECT6], [PROJECT6] -

(PERSON3) Hm.(PERSON4) Visu-, um, [PROJECT6] heat maps and [PROJECT2] heat maps and I know that some [PROJECT6] heat maps are completely different from balustrades.(PERSON4) So I, I, um, I donít know whether to, um, how to, how to write about it in a, in the text because I know that they are, um, very different.(PERSON4) I, I, I, I know that it was one parameter I donít know, I donít know which one but it was like layer something, um, not layer normalization, not was, something similar but, um, yeah.So, I, I donít know whether to, whether to only write OK.

We tested this thing of, um, neural machine translation and we tested bad and (beside the, beside) the outcomes or <unintelligible> try more param-, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and ñ 

Um, but it will be much more and more complicated how to, how to say something about that so.(PERSON3) Well, you can just add a footnote commenting that, that, it, it might be an artifact of [PROJECT9] because, because one <unintelligible> the heat maps look slightly different.(PERSON1) I think it mostly comes from like concentration of the distribution because in [PROJECT2], [PROJECT2] also something like balustrades so this like straight lines but still the distribution is not so focused -

(PERSON4) Itís not, not so focused, yeah.Cause I used like blue on white, u-, you <unintelligible> like bright -

<laugh>

On black then I see those -

(PERSON4) Yeah, but I -

(PERSON1) <unintelligible>.I, I will somehow -

So that way I, I spent a lot of time on that chapter and on that section and I still have not finish it.Only and -

Yeah, I would like to, um, so I, maybe I will, I will go through my chapter and go, um, say what is needed to be, to be -

What are the new content this, that are needed to be, um, added.I have many, still many [PERSON3]ís comments there -

<laugh>

And it should be rewritten because, um, there are some things that are, that should not be there and maybe, yeah, should be, that should be changed.Only, I would like to, I would like to add, um, add the figures and I'd like to add some, um, conclusions and some, um, tables about, about proportions on different attentions, um, att-, attentions patterns.(PERSON4) Um, then I have a section about highly, um, about the written that attention heads that mainly the paper from, of [PERSON10] et al.(PERSON4) And, and then there should be the section about the interpretability, um, whether it is really inter-, interpretable, or not, the attentions.And this is almost -

Right, the contents are there almost but it must be rewritten and I donít know what, um, how much details to give there because I have some tables there but they maybe, maybe they are not needed.So, I think itís better we donít write it like one hundred fifty-eight, right, itís OK for a book.So and I donít know how much content is still missing for the other chapters but, um, I think for my chapter itís now twenty pages long and I think it will have maybe a bit more but not much.<laugh>

Anyway -

(PERSON3) <?another_language?>

(PERSON7) And trying to write as much as possible without it necessarily making much sense -

<laugh>

Um, s-, so that I have something that somebody can comment, and we can work on it.Because otherwise I would be crafting perfect paragraphs, um, at the, no, at the parade of maybe one a week, maybe one in two weeks and thatís unusable.Anyway during working on this I, I came to the conclusion that this chapter really, the, the old idea of having a story is not really doable for me because I donít know that much of the history and I would have to spend another half a year reading things.So, I think I would concentrate on visualisations of embeddings and comparing visualisations of different embeddings inside that because all the papers thereís always this interesting visualisation but then not, no other paper does the same thing.For example, thereís the, there are the (bands) in the Glove, um, Glove vectors and they say that the same structure can, is, that can be seen in, in other similar vectors as well.But I havenít seen it done for Word2vec, anything so -

Also, that can be like the one of the contributions of this book that I will -

(PERSON3) It shouldn't be too difficult.It will not be difficult, and they will take up a lot of space so -

<laugh>

Um -

(PERSON3) Alright.And also, I donít think I will be writing very much about, um, the generative, the new generative language models because like they are based on sub-words and the embeddings are not interesting anymore.So, I think if we are to speak about these models which I donít think we have to because they are so recent then we can just -

(PERSON4) Hm.So thatís, Iím the - the, the, the, the -

Thatís the overview of where my chapter is going, and I have a few questions about data, but I think it will be easier to ñ 

If I just write them on Slack and we will discuss it there because I have to run anyway.Well, I think I -

Up to component analysis itís almost there but, yeah, OK.

Maybe donít...

Four point three is more or less commentable.Four point four, thatís m-, mostly copied from elsewhere and I need to go for it once again and then four point five will be just a note so it will disappear.(PERSON7) And I ment -

And then like lot of the visualisation that I want to do are missing and thatís why I want to talk about the data and what data should I do the visualisations on but I think it will be better to let that discussion to Slack.OK.

(PERSON3) It, it, it seems to me that there is a quite a big overleap or, um, I forgot what, what, what, what is, was.So, Iím planning to go through at least the first two, um, articles mentioned in the three, zero, one.(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON3) Oh, you probably really can you if you set manually the section counter to minus one and, and then at the section it, it will probably get zero.(PERSON4) OK.

<laugh>

Good to know.So, you can redefined the numbers and...

<laugh>

Or you can just write the macro that rewrites everyone to zero and, and...

<laugh>

(PERSON6) Then it will be fun to read.<laugh>

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON7) Yeah.Anyway, I have to run so...

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON7) Sorry about that and -

(PERSON4) So -

So [PERSON6]?(PERSON6) Yeah, so I can, I can share my screen so that -

(PERSON4) Yeah, it will be better.OK.

Um, so, um, so I, Iím restruct-, restructured the section so now what should be definitely readable is like the structure.<laugh>

So, the things that are there should stay where they are, already and I, I need to add more, um, things somewhere.Titles of sections and basically the things that are there mostly should stay there or be made shorter maybe or rewritten a bit but kind of the contents thatís there should be mostly there.(PERSON6) Introduction, I have to change the whole thing basically because itís just some left over stuff from the previous introduction which rely it on some stuff that we moved to other chapters, so it doesnít make much sense now.Um, so the plan is that it should contain, um, it should be partitioned to, to several subsections mostly the ones that are there already, probably.Um, so somewhere I just need to say that OK there are these different models, and some are better than other, and some capture more syntax than other and so on.(PERSON3) By the way "Who is better", is, is, is a very bad title of the section.So, I should probably begin with morphology and right now there are some parts moved from other parts of the text so itís not very coherent, um -

<laugh>

But in general, this is what should be there and, um, there are some more works that are not there yet which I plan to add.Um, so, um, yeah, itís a same thing so itís, itís, um, things from different parts of the chapter now moved together to one syntax section and -

Yeah, I think I'm missing still some of the key, um, papers that find syntax in there.<other_noise>

And then the rest i-, itís -

Yeah, Iím not really sure about the division here so I have a section which is now called "Semantics", um, and Iím really not absolutely sure which things belong into semantics.I, I see only word (senses) and -

(PERSON6) Yeah, this is the -

OK.

Um, yeah.You have the [PERSON3]ís face there, so you donít see the -

(PERSON4) Aha.<laugh>

Um, so, um, I donít know for example there is, um, work on noun gender -

(PERSON3) Noun gender is probably lexical semantics.Yeah, well the, the point was that to result the coreference in the Winograd test you really need and actually to understand the meaning of the words kind of -

(PERSON3) Yeah.Yeah, I, Iím, I was thinking whether to really try to say which is semantics or whether to have multiple smaller subsections and just say coreference and -

(PERSON3) Yeah.(PERSON4) I, I have a discussion with [PERSON1] whether part of speech (tags) are syntax or morphology.So, so the same could be done for syntax but Iím just saying syntax but there is constituents in syntax, the, the labels, the structure.So, I, Iíll re-split it, it (work).(PERSON4) Any-, anyone know what are the, the smaller, the smaller sections so -

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.So, um, right now itís a, a lot of, um, paragraphs, small paragraphs moved from elsewhere, um, so I should get a bigger picture on that and put it here.So, I found it interesting, so I think we should have a section on that.But maybe something else for different usage so, um, I havenít read much about that so, um, um, but but I think it belongs -

I donít know, um, I think it belongs here because I mean like the effect on what the representations capture after that, um...

Yeah, um, so I think this should be like maybe two pages, now itís one paragraph.(PERSON6) Cause itís a mess anyway, so -

<laugh>

(PERSON1) Yeah.(PERSON6) Um, it ñ

We want to cover itís somehow, somewhere and I really havenít written anything about it and I donít even know if it should fit into this chapter or if it should be a separate chapter and I donít know what we actually want to write about it.So, we only know this from [PERSON3] that we want to put the, um, the multilinguality paper that we submitted to -

(PERSON4) Yeah.(PERSON6) So, um, so I donít know if, if anybody, um, wants to take over this section, I, I would be glad but.<laugh>

(PERSON6) I donít even know if we want to put it into this chapter cause, um, in some way -

(PERSON3) I think we -

I think we do because itís about, itís about the hidden states of multilingual [PROJECT2].I can ask [PERSON9] and I will write him like the official -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) If it is OK.

(PERSON3) Hm.(PERSON4) Itís for the, it, the part of the introduction -

(PERSON6) Hm.So, itís now in a stage where it should be reasonably easy to, to add the missing information there and, and organize it into a readable way and, yeah.(PERSON4) So, please, first organize the, the, the sections so that I can, I can send it to [PERSON9].(PERSON4) Um, add these to table of contents -

(PERSON6) Hm.<laugh>

(PERSON6) OK.

(PERSON4) Yeah.Um, so, yeah, the initial plan was to submit it to [PROJECT1] and -

(PERSON3) Hm.(PERSON4) Because maybe -

(PERSON1) Yeah and itís also there, I donít know if <unintelligible> accept like this kind of -

(PERSON6) Hm.Yeah, maybe -

(PERSON1) I can also show you like the survey visualisation for that so -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.Um, so yeah, so, so itís mostly a thing what also [PERSON6] was talking about.So, so in one pair there is probing of RNN hidden state versus static for embeddings so it could be the, um, it could be Glove or, or Word2vec.Um, itís hard to compare like dots between themselves bec-, because, um, like different paper use different, different types of data and think different <unintelligible> and there's like many different things.Um, so, yeah, so this is like here everything from recurrent neural networks so is better then more the embeddings which is not thatís, thatís really.Um, but, yeah, there, there is the paper that said that, that machine translation is really better than, than language model, um, and -

No, language model is better than machine translation, um, but I, I couldnít like really say it from -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON1) It was, was, it was (cinder) but itís like different comparisons to different s-, mostly it came from the fact that language model had more data for pretraining.(PERSON1) Encoders so there are quite not, not that good to, to have the, um, have the, these part speech encoded in them like mostly because, um, the, the task is very simple just to translate from lan-, one language to the same language so it <unintelligible>.(PERSON4) It could be, could be -

(PERSON6) Yeah, I think it would be nice too, to include this.<laugh>

Iím fine with writing the text but -

<laugh>

Um -

(PERSON4) Because some probing is, isnít there are not as many visualisation -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) And...

(PERSON3) If you, um, if you're spending time with that I would, I would suggest, um, generating them as in, in, as PGF so itís, itís basically in, in, Tix and -

(PERSON4) PFG?(PERSON4) I, I <unintelligible> it will be the last thing I will, I will do ab-, I will first have them somehow -

(PERSON6) Hm.(PERSON4) At the, at the end because <unintelligible> -

(PERSON3) If you, if you have a look -

If you have a look in deep learning images slash, um, <unintelligible>, underscore, encoding, um, you can, youíll see how to, how to set up, um, the LaTeX format.(PERSON3) And you, you d-, do what I, what I do at the top would, um, after, um, after importing Matplotlib and then you just save it with, with PGF.(PERSON3) So, you then just do input in LaTeX and, and LaTeX would take care about all the forms that will be the same as, as in the rest in the book.So, I, yeah, so I will update my, my scripts into my script.(PERSON4) Um, yeah, we should, we should discuss everything like, um, actually, in like during the, during the week so that we update it.
