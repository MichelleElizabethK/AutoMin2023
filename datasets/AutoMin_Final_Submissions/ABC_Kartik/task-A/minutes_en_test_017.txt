  If the timestamps of the beginning and the end of the sentence are not zeros, then they don't know PERSON1 and PERSON2 are working on the cruise control.
  They need to synchronize and make sure that the relevant code is available.

  As a PERSON4 and PERSON2 want to know next week what will be supported at PROJECT4 workshop.
