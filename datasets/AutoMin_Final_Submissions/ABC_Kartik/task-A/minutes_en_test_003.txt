ATTENDEES : PERSON9, PERSON12, PERSON4, PERSON13, PERSON7, PERSON8


SUMMARY-

  There was a live workshop dry run at the LOCATION1 on Wednesday.
  The technology works technically, but it's not usable for people who don't speak OTHER4.
  In the next session with PERSON7, they will watch some video in OTHER2.
  If anybody can speak OTHER2 PERSON9 is studying at ORGANIZATION3.
 -PERSON2 will join them for the surge, depending on his availability.
 -PERSON6 is giving a talk on Monday at 2.
 -PERSON13 managed to convert the script into bigger script, so the processing should be faster.
 -PERSON8 will double check if anyone responded to the e-mail.
 -PERSON8 will get in touch with PERSON7 and feed the files to him so he can use them for the Monday talk.
 -PERSON9 worked on three different things this week: a visualization tool on the old realization tool, a server in C++ and a JavaScript piece of code that can be included in any webpage even on a remote machine.
 -PERSON7 will email PERSON8 the scripts to test the ASR.
  He used a data set of 300 million open subtitles from various languages and trained the model with TPU.
 -PERSON8 will send PERSON9 the models that correctly load on the GPU's.
 -Person9 will probably have to export them as an open neural network exchange format.
 -Person8 and Person9 don't know if it's possible to do that PERSON8 wants PERSON9 to send him the data set for PROJECT2.
 -PERSON9 will apply the same models on the same data.
 -PERSON5 has access to the source files.
 -PERSON4 is going back to work part time next week, so she has limited time for this project.
 -PERSON10 helped her integrate buffer in the LOCATION2 segmenter.
 -PERSON7 is looking for a data set with the correct transcripts for the LOCATION2 presentation.
 -PERSON9 wants to create a Wiki page with all the data that they are using, or they plan to use.
  The data ambassador is on vacation this week, so he might not be able to help, but he is the person who knows the most and he will organize this.
