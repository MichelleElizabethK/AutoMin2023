i finally managed to train fasttext embeddings.
and as you can see the bands are actually there.
the fasttext image here seems much more, um, similar to the original glove that i trained..
[person24] you can see the bands here and the bands here in the fasttext s image are similar.
[person21] it's possible for czech, not for english.
[person24] yes.
but fasttext shows the structure right away.
[person24] yes.
but it's possible for czech, not for english.
[person24] yes.
but it's possible for czech, not for english..
i've written something about debiassing i wrote a conclusion.
tonight the chocolates will be in the box and i rewrite the chocolates.
i'll either move it to your chapture or delete it..
[person14] and figures at least in pdf and not it pgf, it's no problem.
[person14] if we don't change the content of the figures just how they look.
[person14] if only (the font) change and the picture will be same only the nicer and then i m sure it's ok..
[person20] just, just avoid an other unintelligible> font.
[person24] you will have figures in the missing sections like pca and ica.
[person20] you can replot it so it has the same font as a book.
[person24] sorry, what? [person20] you can replot it so it has the same font as a book..
[person14] so do you think you can make it to today or? more or less? [person14] i think so.
[person14] ok, i can do that.
after the text is written.
and finished.
[person14] so that you know that you really have it, the chocolate is (reorder) in the box.
[person14] yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.
[person14] yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.

i think it s better if we have like, like one unintelligible> reviewer from, from [location1], when we have the book alm-, almost finished, we can, we can ask someone.
[person20] yeah.
[person14] it would be at least abstract or i don t know if i ask only, ok, we will have a book with unintelligible> about - [person6] hm.
book, books often have summaries.
and they have the summaries in multiple languages so.
[person14] boo-, book, book summary is, is more like, um, lon-, longer abstract usually.
[person14] but the introduction would also be something like, what is the - [person20] hm.
[person6] yeah, there are no rules, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in czech and something like that..
[person14] i think longest book in the series would be the (light) lexikons.
[person20] or [person27] might be a good candidate.
[person13] 119.
[person14] but this is unintelligible> lexikon.
[person14] yeah, [person15] 110.
