the more you do, the better, because the more reliable the estimates are.
if you really go down and probe you should probably use more than this ([organization2]..
i give it unintelligible> to [other1] open sense to me, yellow paper.
what they do attention and and compution scores would interesting in the sense that in their unintelligible> 60 internet use emm try to use sentences and test on harder, weirder like constructions.
the attention actually still manages to find the proper subjects for the nouns..
we haven't so far we haven't connected, we want to we want to have a skype call that we need.
so we've do first create organized call here with the leader here of this group.
and then we'll let you know and then we will see..
ee chunked down from much attention eh is focused of the first of words data in ee syntactic laytion.
one observation was that (for the), let's say easier unintelligible> find the determiners or multifiers.
ehm and it's also one head that's very very surprised look that (penny sour) for determiner is the multifiers it's subjects or objects and looks in the last layer .
if you take the shorter phrases or shorter (balustrades) there are almost all all possible balustrades somewhere.
[person7] it seems that the different heads do different stuffs.
it's not easy to eeh that there maybe different different settings and little bit difference settings of transformer that generates completely different results..
i wanted to try ehm extract the graph structures compare how was like similar syntactic trees or different types of trees we can (extract) from syntax.
[person5] until half of december.
the 15th december.
[person5] okay, so, we can meet each other personally because we will i will be taken in the beginning in december.
[person5] until half of december.
the 15th december.
[person5] okay, so,.
two heads or eeh that were trained to be similar to a that attentions in the syntactic unintelligible>, syntactic (precedence) or syntactic.
by this training they also report better better results improvement in they in they target these two heads like gold syntax.
so they don't need the syntax annotation when translating so it's it's learnt..
i think this gonna be trying to get more reliable.
[person3] and right prophans cause i think this gonna be trying to get more reliable.
[person10] cause cause i know you read the paper as well i don't think need to talk about this one.
[person3] unintelligible> put [person9] in seminar.
[person10] still the waiting if [person8] reappears.
[person3] unintel.
[person3] but there was unintelligible> the paper it would become diversial one in [project4] but that seem to like in multilingual context into record most detected function.
[person10] uhm uhm.
[person3] i guess our our assumption is that we have probably the attentions are what task.
[person6] i think it's okay, should be really continue analysing the transformers that we have or should we unintel.
i think make something who unintelligible> model.
[person3] very find unintelligible> is expecting just unintelligible> research.
[person6] i think he was planning to come back in the beginning of december while i'm staying where is unintelligible>.
[person10] okay, yeah.
and analyse that.
[person3] like like like model one on one unintellig.
