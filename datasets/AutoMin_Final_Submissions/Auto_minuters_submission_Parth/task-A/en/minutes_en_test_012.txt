mary sorrow will be on the call on monday to talk about the proposed development schedule.
in-between will be (python sorrow) that's excepts sentences for translation from the [organization2] worker.

i wrote email to [person10] and [person1] and [person8] but i'm not sure if [person8] is the rigt persons for it..
