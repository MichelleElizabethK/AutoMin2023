the goal for today will be to get ehm> everything (money) on this full workload.
(person7) we can already get to ehm> cough> ehm> for - call the whole wednesday, (person7) and tuesday afternoon is also very ehm> likely.
(person7) the real (video mixer) is ordered an will be there, so this is something that we ehm> can .

(person2) unfortunately, ehm>, oter_noise> is not ehm> perfect.
(person3) ehm> ehm> ehm> ehm.
wednesday is surely available from the very morning and tuesday ehm> afternoon is also extremely likely.
if you come already at tuesday lunchtime, we will make use of ehm> all the ehm> unintelligible> ehm> available ehm> very well..
if all the interpreters int he four ehm> (booths) would see ehm> their ehm> subtitles as the're being recognised, i believe the quality would be much ehm> better.
i want you to doublecheck with [person1], whether ehm> the ehm> notebooks also in the interpreters' (booths) can still connect for more laptops to the internet .
if we can ehm> do it in a different way, it would be better.
if - i thing it would - (person2) my - my only wor- worry is about unintelligible>, ehm> let's say ehm>, service languages (like) unintelligible> one unintelligible> two and so on.

ehm> i think (there) - is many sensible ways ehm> how he can record something and still not record any of the participants, ehm> and not our (inper)- iterpreters as well.
(person7) is a - the room ehm>, the lecture room, is - you don't need an id card to enter this room, ehich is different from the normal premises of ([.
ehm> even with the interpreters, ehm> there was this requirement ehm> for the confidentiality or (no dis)closure, so i don't think it will be this easy to - get permission to record anything.
ehm> we'll have a (nondisclosure) agreement for ehm> for him as well.
ehm> since the time is ehm> getting short.
i don't know, maybe some of the sessions should be like ehm> close (person2) for us or - i don't know what the setup would be.
if you look at the subtitles it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
i would say - (person22) i will check what does it listen to parallel_talk> yeah..
i - i - i - i turned (english) off and i started german, cause i struggled with - (plunging) english and german at once.
i'll have to leave for another call in thirty minutes from now, but [person22] and [person17] will be ehm> here.
i - i think - parallel_talk> you (mustn't) uninte.
ehm> i still see a lot of ehm> old english subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable - parallel_talk> (person7) i think ehm> there still be in- incremental transcription problem to be (solved out) ehm> there's a way to (flush) ehm> within the ehm> presentation platform .

com, ehm> there should be ehm> little or no delay between my words and what and what appears in the english.
i - d - like at this point i see the english stuck and no ehm> words of mine.

(person3) there's a problem in ehm> unintelligible> for storying a used data.
(person2) neither ehm> username and password (that they) - (person3) oh, we don't need a unintelligible> participant username and password.
(person3) and no usernames are needed, just something to prevent anyone from anywhere to listen (in).
one segmenter is running but the second one is not running.
(person3) i don't even know which one you're connected to.
(person5) so, the problem might be - that - maybe the audio is not unintelligible> sent correctly.
