  - Disc: He is interested in putting together the censorship pipeline after PROJECT5. 
* PERSON3 is unable to respond in time to a technical call on the disabling of the outputs of the life editing tool. 
* He suggests a call between PERSON14, PERSON5, PERSON9, PERSON7, and maybe [PONENTHAN] and the second lost person. 
* PERSON8's task is to generate synthetic multi-source train set. 
  - Fact: The paperwork is still in the process. 
  - Fact: When he gets the cluster access, he will check if the paperwork is already processed enough and write the training instructions for the model he is supposed to train. 
* PERSON8 wants to have access to the system and cluster so he can do something with it. 
  - Fact: It's two GPUs per machine, so it's not for 8, but for larger ones. 
  - Disc: The memory of the cluster is full, like this cluster is. 
* It is hard to receive more than one GPU there. PERSON4, PERSON8, PERSON9 and PERSON9 will wait for their cluster to arrive. It's hard to get more than 1 GPU there". 
* PERSON9 and PERSON7 should be working on the multilingual PROJECT5 systems now. 
* They will discuss it directly after the call with PERSON3. 
  - Fact: PERSON9 will send them the summary of the current summary and send them how they do data collection in ORGANIZATION6. 
* PERSON2 is working on data data augmentation for PROJECT5. His model is only for offline processing. 
  - Disc: If his model works well, it will be integrated into PROJECT1's test set. The best person to help him with the onlinezation of his model would probably be PERSON9. 
* PERSON2, Peter and Umar will use the CTC end-to-end model or the cascaded model from PERSON2's thesis. 
  -- Disc: The evaluation of the offline runs is the deciding thing. 
  - Disc: They will ask Umar to work on the same data and keep training. 
* PERSON3 wants Umar and PERSON2 to train as a comparin-compa- comparison in using the exact same training data, exact of evaluation, and to be in touch with each other. 
  - Disc: PERSON9 has an idea for a new training system. 
* PERSON9 suggests transfer learning on on of double encoder model on small GPus. 
  - Fact: If they have trained model for English-Czech and German-C Czech, then you can try to copy the parameters from one encoder to the other one from one model.

* He needs to check the details. 
  - Disc: He didn't understand the instructions because he didn't know what the task was.
