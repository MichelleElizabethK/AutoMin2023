  -- Fact: He doesn't know if PERSON3 has highlighted the portions of the document with the colourful papers. 
  - Fact: He didn't have the free minute since then to do it, so he didn't do it. 
* PERSON1 is worried about the availability of PERSON5. He was about to move to Canada, so he might not be able to help them as much as they would have hoped for. It will not make their lives easier, but they have to work with it. 
* PERSON1 wants to know how far the annotator got on the list of named entities that he sent to PERSON2. The annotator stopped responding after Christmas and he didn't finish the list. 
  - Disc: The document is an online document so it's not a problem with it being an online. 
* PERSON1 needs to get in touch with PERSON5 and double check that he would be able to do the processing at the token level. For many of the words, the annotators should have indicated, that it depends on the context, and for these context dependent. 
* PERSON2 will open the agenda and send a link so that he and PERSON1 can write down the information they want to transfer to PERSON5, but it will get lost somewhere in the middle and they won't be able to transfer it all at once. 
* PERSON1, PERSON2 and PERSON3 are discussing the agenda for the virtual coffee meeting. 
  - Fact: The agenda is in the master document so they can check the Coffee Meetings. The last meeting is from the middle of December, so five people are there. 
* PERSON1 wants to get in touch with PERSON5. If he doesn't respond, they have to recreate it themselves. There is a de-identification procedure. PERSON2 will be back in 30 seconds. PERSON1 will write the procedure here. 
* PERSON1 explains how the process of annotating a document is carried out. 
  - Disc: It is documented to the finest detail, but it's not complete yet.

* They need to remove all named entities from documents and replace them with place holders. 
  - Fact: They are going to work at the word type level and the word token level. 
  - Disc: They will then work on the context level. 
* PERSON1 is worried about the availability of the person who was supposed to do the bulk processing of the documents and the insertion of the annotations into the Xml. The programmer's skill is needed to do that. If that person is not available, someone else will have to do it. 
* PERSON1 and PERSON2 are critical of the quality of the collection of candidates that was done by PERSON5. 
  - Fact: There are a lot of typos in the list and most of the output is not a named entity. 
  - Disc: It could have been better if name tag was used. 
* PERSON1 and PERSON2 have a problem with the edition of new documents and multi-word NEs. 
* They need to make sure there are no NE leaks into the final data. They also need to check if the program included all the words beginning from cPROJECT4tal. 
* The last stage is the actual removal of the original text from the documents, leaving just the Xml mark-up to indicate. 
* The replacement of a document does not need to be a replacement, but like the actual actual removal from the document. 
  - Disc: The problem will also be this closed lists.

* They decide to ignore the identity or tracing of the identities of the individual speakers for the summarization. They also decide to preserve the identity and project names. 
* PERSON1 and PERSON2 agree to ignore the tracing of chains for speakers and for persons. The data set will not suffer much if the tracing is ignored for the purposes of summarizing the data set. If someone refers to Jane at the top of the meeting and someone else refers to her at the end of the meetings, it will be the same being. 
* PERSON1, PERSON2, and PERSON3 need to put an outline on a time frame. They need to get in touch with PERSON5 and extract from him the information if he can do this for them. If not, they need to do it themselves.

* PERSON1 and PERSON7 will focus on the second form which is the consent to publish the data. The first form will be on the content to process the data and deidentify it with the forcing goal of publication. They will come back to the first form only once the corpus is finished and released. 
* PERSON1 and PERSON2 are discussing the task of collecting samples for a project. 
* They agree that the task should be simplified by giving everyone access to the full data set and preparing a consent form for every participant.

  -- Disc: It will keep well from the masters, but it will be separate from them.
