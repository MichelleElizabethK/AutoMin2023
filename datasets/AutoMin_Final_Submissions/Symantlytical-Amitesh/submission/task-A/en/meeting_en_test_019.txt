(PERSON3) Yeah, sorry, for the delay and sorry for the complications. The goal is to synchronize the group, and the date and time eh, the so the day and time of the week is chosen, uh, so that it is fits to most of us. So one of those is [PERSON4], for example, eh, so eh I would later ask [PERSON4] to eh, to to give us a brief summary of what he he has been working on for the past months actually. We´ll be anonymizing these calls, so we´ll be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholders and so. And if the [ORGANIZATION17] Congress is actually not happening. (PERSON4) Eh, and the- then since then I haven´t actually been working on so much. So, so what I thought is that I would eeh -
I would go over some, eh, some more pages, wer- where there are actually some videos, and to download transcripts from there. (PERSON4) So this way I I obtained eh -
Yes, so so in the free version there are some limitations. And also what I have actually discovered is that [ORGANIZATION2] -
It´s not [ORGANIZATION2] sorry, [ORGANIZATION6]. And it takes like up to a minutes to translate just one hundred sentences. Eh, the idea that I have there is that we could use them for eh, teacher- student. It used to be [PERSON12], but eh, he is giving that to -
Is that you [PERSON7], is that you? And eh, [PERSON13] who has worked on the [PROJECT1]test set will join us only from December. Eeh, but the [PROJECT1] test set is there and eeh, s- so maybe if eh, [PERSON6] can briefly summarize the status of the [PROJECT4]. Not just for us, and not just for the [PROJECT1] project, but also for others doing a spoken language translation. And the [PROJECT1] test set contains the input texts and references and also input sounds and reference transcripts. So [PERSON5] can help with that eh, to -
So [PERSON9] and [PERSON5] to evaluate all the workers that are in the [PROJECT1] pipeline. Eh and the mhm eh, so -
Now we´re doing this like stress test within the consortium. And what [PERSON6] was talking about that is the plan to publish it finally at eh, at a conference. Uh, so for that, we would really like to have it eh, very nicely commented in a paper. And also Peter Polak -
So you could also evaluate your [PROJECT5] systems on [PROJECT4]. (PERSON3) Eh, so I think it should be the same tool, and it should try to connect to the [ORGANIZATION7]and download it. But whenever you have time, I prefer to talk with you around half an hour to an hour to finalize it. (PERSON5) Yes, so I´m like completely lost here, because o- one of my lectures is scheduled so I´m attending lecture as well as the the meeting. And the most urgent thing to do is getting the evaluation of the of all the systems, of all the components from the eh, mediator, all the connected workers, running through ELITR test set. (PERSON3) And eh, the urgent most thing indeed -
(PERSON5) Just -
Yeah. When when it didn´ t see anything bad, but there was something bad. (PERSON6) Okay, so if it is possible please contact [PERSON14] and ask him for this call and if you want I can also attend the the call to -
(PERSON3) Yeah. So [PERSON9] and [PERSON5] are technically the same person there. And eh, now he eh, is also partly part-time employed on [PROJECT1] to develop multi source eh, models. I have asked eh -
My task were so far to generate synthetic multi-source train set. Okay, because I written there considering it is probably already okay to write them. And then we can combine it with with English- Czech, which is already high quality from [PROJECT6]
(PERSON3)Yeah. And also we can take a look in the  -
And I can also send you eh how how they do this eh data collection in [ORGANIZATION6, if  that would help. Because that is something which we would -
If your model eh, evaluates well, using [PROJECT4] on [PROJECT1] test set, we would like to have that integrated. So please keep that in mind eh, that we want to evaluate your model and if it looks good, then we want to have that integrated. The eh, the [ORGANIZATION11], translates phonemes and then followed by transform. Always try it with small models and small data, and only once it works technically and does something very useful or on on this very small data set. (PERSON3) Yeah, oka.y
So I´ll have to leave myself at this moment as well. Uh, so the the purpose of this meeting was eh, very greatly fulfilled. I have one or two - 
So first of all I need <unintelligible> on which you´re working <unintelligible> can you share the path with me? What I´m uh, really eh, working on is eh, like call it there chopped data set and with that I I I´m using regular eh, speech data set. And that´s why the the models which are trained only on on common voice are quite bad. (PERSON2) Uh, well, it´s not the Interspeech challenge, because it it was due twentieth of September. Then there´s eight percent England English, five percent India and South Asia accent, four percent Australian English, three percent Canadian, two percent Scottish. On the the data set also contains information about age and gender. So because eeh, there is a lots of textual written data sets. And we can try to synthetize eh, using the existing words this new data sets. And I fine tuned it to -
Because it´s end-to-end model I fine- tuned it to recognize phonemes exe- eh, eh rather than graphemes. But uh, I guess the the [ORGANIZATION13]Common voice is the best option as-
If I recall correctly, the most papers that work with accented speech eh, were are working with the Common voice data set. Multi-lingual are different, and well, multi-accented are different.
