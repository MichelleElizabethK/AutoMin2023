person11 ( person11 ) hi , guys ( person12 ) , so you can tell us about the presentation platform , which now requires password so what should we use to the see anything < q > it 's not a email its something i invented by myself and the second one the [ project1 ] 2019 is the password ( person12 ] a person11 ( person12 ) is a new type of person 's target languages < q > it 's the same asr worker type launched as many times as there is sort of the target languages , and thats putting stress on organization2 < q > there is nothing in the protocol `` unintelligible list , `` says person12 a list of ten lines are produced by one from eb client or is it that the eb clients connect and asks the mediator once with all these then targets at once there are six , and i 'm going to run it on one , two , three , five , seven , eight , nine , ten < q > there are no available asr and at this point there are three , so probably three asr crashed from the seven and were released the eb client would ship the audios to the mediator and get the segment output from the segmenter beside mediator < q > it would send it to the different machine translation of systems as like another eb client could do the right ? tommorow 's list of ` person12 ' is based on the telephone number < q > the publisher says it 'll be around on wednesday , thursday and friday < q > '' person12 `` is a great way to manage the list person13 ( person13 ) ah from german ( person12 ) will still investigate < q > the presentation platform is so that we can make little platform running locally person12 is a real organization4 presentation platform and web page < q > it 168.168.168. and the number of the lan ( person12 ) and that should work , right ? the spanish coming from the german translation or english translation can also be able to understand which stream as problem is the problem < q > there will be three person speaking english the one in the round table , and th beside unintelligible classics with corrects the eb client determines the english channel its either one of the respeakers or the , the person from the round table < q > i agree with you that , we do not want to have to use different english for different target languages , but i think that it is possible that it 's possible a client for the mediator says it 's like two different text messages interchanging < q > it 's possible to debug asr workers and create multiplexing < q > one thing that felt strange so there was the same english sentence presentation platform , a so that the present-wrelligible list , could be removed from the or disabled , at the presentation platform < q > it 's possible to be an updated hypothesis that your presentation platform would be popping into two parts and showing them one after another bob greene : in the long term , the segmenter worker should be delierig well again < q > he says there is no end of sentence in the original speech , but the subtitles worker is stuck with like i have shown only something < q > greene : when the segmentation worker is the one who would be forcefully cutting the sentences , rather than the presentation platform person13 ( person13 ) is connected ten of them , and only one empty worker was busy < q > when you run ( person12 ) it could be some delay with information about the availability of two workers , so that if you know it is watch command , it 's watch command ` person13 [ person13 ] is concerned about empty workers not being used , while they are already in use by the pipelines < q > i think that the admin interface is simply slow so only when you run something for longer period of time then the numbers would be correct person14 is available on wednesday , thursday and friday < q > [ person14 ] is now , [ person2 ] can you hear us or not ? [ person13 ] is again among the participants list on the pexip call soi 's idea was that you could setup simple cgi script or pc script < q > it would be possible if you set it up on the machine where the workers are , so that it can kill them and the firewalls must not be in the way , but it could be just the few lines of code person12 no is no asr workers in the uu , so that is very fragile , because you can accidently kill things which are dont has the asr workers ' asr workers < q > it 's possible to have a script to make restarting one faster < q > it will be possible for a number of ten of them to be on the list person11 is one third of the page and before the first message waiting for the client < q > it 's the point in the code where the worker knows its session id person12 uses the provided library so it does n't know how to use the library < q > it 's only about our presentation platform ( person12 ) < q > ` person12 ) ' is the only way to use precompiled library person12 is a great way to keep you run , says person6 < q > it 's been called person12 ( person12 ) < q > there are more than 53 telephone numbers
