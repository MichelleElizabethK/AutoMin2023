person14 ( person13 ) hi [ person14 ) hi [ person person14 ] hi ( person14 ) < q > ok . so maybe i 've emailed [ person8 ] , if [ person8 ) would be joining as well person14 is ok. that 's very good and is there also some text only a client or text only < q > this could be useful for connecting to other unexpected ways of presenting person12 is the only way of running the pipeline < q > it works with czech machine translation < q > it 's also possible then some cases it 's not confirming to the interface a worker round is the only one who 's left ( person10 ) , so if every sentence on the input and with period , it 's not great < q > ok . ( person12 ) actually , this week we work together with [ person12 ] and [ person5 ] , in order to find better workarounds the online operational mode will be slightly different from what we get offline < q > the segmentation is all prepared for offline asr is reasonably close to what online asr < q > the visual is still the so-what is your current , you 've discuss this 5 minutes ago person14 is the one that [ person13 ] mentioned ? [ person12 ] < q > it sounds like the same thing ( person13 ) , it sound , sound and sound < q > asr output that will be getting as messages when it goes through the mediator ` person13 ' was manually invented in the first - ( person14 ) , but it 's not affected by mismatching segmentation between the training mode and the operation mode < q > there could be benefits , from , the integration of the art , so , it 's sufficient , we do n't know , some small sample of online asr person12 updating and redoing updating and redoings updating < q > segmentation worker is usually the next thing on our list of priorities < q > list is the oldest component of that pipeline worker project2 workers or text client is the second to that machine worker < q > it 's not available , but it does n't work with my os- batchmode asr workers are n't reliable , but only in sequence with first asr < q > ok . ( person10 ) is on asr on ` unintelligible ' list < q > there is no immediate plan to have such client ` person9 ' is one of the list ' list 's list of the most-expensive telephone telephones < q > the list is based on the legendary mediator , which is new in a java the segmentor- ( person12 ) does n't handle unsegmented text < q > it only handles the text as it comes out of the segmentor- after- ( person14 ) < q > it 's the sort of everything except the actual neural networks part that is doing the work the slt [ organization5 ] plus the train labourer model is just the labeling , the labourer < q > it 's also important for the asr integrations , which is now like overseen by [ person12 ] ` person10 ' is ok. , so it 's your github account [ person13 ) < q > there will be session , session with ` unintelligible ' list < q > it 's possible to list the list 's list of ` unintelligible phrases ' presentation platform is just um a presentation platform < q > it 's a new component of the work project and we have to reason about it really carefully presentation platform will recieve of course more streams ( person14 ) < q > jarrett bellini : the client is not happy with the machine translation that i 'm getting from that the software stream number 44 is the one to show , because stream number 35 was big has become like of bad polity , right ? < q > this is the preview functionality that will be for june , says person14 < q > it 's not clear that the stream will be available for the preview of the subtitle the final user will be the client of the subtitle solution < q > the client will connect to a particular stream of publishing subtitles < q > the normal user is selecting which language he wants to see `` person9 `` is a software developer ( person14 ) < q > it 's a technical solution so that 's one thing to find better one
