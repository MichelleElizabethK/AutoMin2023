[PERSON1] is open for [PERSON2]'s  suggestions . and that would be , this is a sentence with , [PERSON6]'s name . And [PERSON1] think that we have to present the full documents . 

[PERSON2] think that uf , individual sentences does are not sufficient , because sometimes they are very short . 

[PERSON2] asked  , do [PERSON4] think that , individual sentences would be sufficient ? [PERSON1] think that the bright yellow is for the maybe ones , that [PERSON4] have to decide . maybe let us do it like green , this is not a name , [with the] [PERSON6]'s name and , [PERSON7]'s name . 

[PERSON1] very often come up with some overkill , . but [PERSON1] would like [PERSON4] to , continue with this , with this markup . And , [PERSON3] , [PERSON1] agree with [PERSON4] that we have to go for the Scientific Committee , do a challenge , with the Scientific Committee , we now need the web page to be completed , that we can put that into that email and ask the people , right ? And [PERSON3] also [ported] the website in the [[PROJECT3]] GitHub .

[PERSON1] actually , [PERSON8] is not on this call . Whenever [PERSON3] will , get some time out of this [studios] , . 

[PERSON2] will of how good , the annotation tool will look like . 

[PERSON4] guess end of this week is good . And [PERSON1] is really , like he wants to have the sample data , at least some files , to be uploaded on the website as soon as possible . And [PERSON3] may want to talk a bit a few more minutes with [PERSON2] , regarding the , proposal . Maybe [PERSON2] [PERSON4] can also take a look . , as always , any person who is having a comorbidity , is susceptible , towards that . this is one of the reason , why [PERSON3] is not , [prefering] . 

[PERSON3] is just waiting for that time . this is actually for the website , in the website , [PERSON3] won't , find this link . 

[PERSON2] can , [PERSON3] should paste the new website link , and [PERSON3] think it is there . the , [PERSON2] see that these are requirements ,[PERSON2] have it already , almost .
