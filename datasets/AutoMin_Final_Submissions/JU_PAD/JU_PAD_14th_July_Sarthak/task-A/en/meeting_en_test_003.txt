Attendees: [PERSON10], [PERSON12], [PERSON13], [PERSON4], [PERSON5], [PERSON6], [PERSON7], [PERSON8], [PERSON9]

Summary:
the news from [PERSON8] are that , we had session like live workshop dry run at the [LOCATION1] on Wednesday and all the presentations went kind of well for the people who could understand [OTHER4] , because that was run in [OTHER4] , and people who had to rely on our subtitling were totally lost . And [PERSON8] do realize that it is not usable for those who do not speak [OTHER4] . 

[PERSON5] asked  , [PERSON9] are in [LOCATION1] , right ? [PERSON9] is studying at [ORGANIZATION3] . 

[PERSON4] is studying also computer science . And what about [PERSON9] , what do [PERSON9] study ? And [PERSON13] also looked into the pronounce and fluxes . And then [PERSON13] would use the corresponding form . In the email , [PERSON13] was asking about . 

[PERSON8] asked  Is there any chance that he would have something for this Monday ? get in touch with [PERSON7] , and make sure that [PERSON13] can feed those files to him , and he can use them . 

[PERSON13] will get in touch with [PERSON7] . But if [PERSON4] are searching for the domain the [LOCATION1] , . actually , [PERSON9] worked on three different things this week . Use like a random value that [PERSON9] think is correct . 

[PERSON8] , [PERSON7] , [PERSON8] have already measured word rate a few times . 

[PERSON8] asked  that we do the first people who are online , ? thank [PERSON8] , that is the first thing , visualisation . And [PERSON9] is going to deploy this data , and this trained model today hopefully . But [PERSON9] had to do it just in , because of the TPU support , most likely [PERSON9] will have to export it as . 

[PERSON8] do not think it is possible to export . 

[PERSON9] think that they can , it can be safely used if we serving , which is just . 

[PERSON9] think that it still be deployed . If [PERSON9] could just send [PERSON9] , just some data set or a link , or just if it is new stats what it is . And [PERSON9] mentioned the third thing . This week [PERSON12] worked on data collection , is basically four five languages , five languagesalmost all the languages have finished , but some remaining . 

[PERSON9] asked  Which language is it again ? [PERSON9] would just make a model where [PERSON9] would throw away the lower source languages , and [PERSON9] would just use the main ones . PERSON1] is collecting monolingual data , and that means that we need to translate this to create synthetic parallel data . And if [PERSON9] have now these models , if [PERSON9] believe these models . 

[ORGANIZATION2] , [PERSON12] already mentioned the . send the path to all the source files that [PERSON12] have to [PERSON5] and [PERSON5] will apply the models , and we will get the first follow synthetic , very much in domain corpus , across these six main languages , and then redo this also with all the other 30 something languages . now [PERSON2] , [PERSON8] do not know if [PERSON12] have anything . Just let [PERSON12] know , [PERSON4] is just going back next week , [PERSON4] work part time , that is the reason [PERSON4] just had limited time for this project , and most of [PERSON4]'s  tasks are translations from [OTHER4] to [OTHER5] to feed anything . helped [PERSON10] integrating buffer in the [LOCATION2] segmenter . And another question , for what [PERSON7] are training on , because if [PERSON7] are training on correct text , and that is the case , then there is a domain mismatch of looked again , and a few sentences that [PERSON11] was like saying in his [LOCATION2] presentation . that is a good question for [PERSON4] , what data set has the correct transcripts which are as this fluent as the natural speech . 

[PERSON8] do not know what is more important . 

[PERSON4] asked  [PERSON4] is sorry , there was some buffering , do [PERSON7] mean data for [LOCATION2] conversations talk ? [PERSON7] asked  Is that right , for [PROJECT2] only ? the our data ambassador is [PERSON11] , who is on vacation this week . And [PERSON8] is not sure if he is coming this week . But he would be the person to organize this , and he knows the most . just hold on , and we are kind of what [PERSON9] want . 

[PERSON8] would not believe how much work it is to convert it to record . Other data and know about them , work for [PERSON11] .
