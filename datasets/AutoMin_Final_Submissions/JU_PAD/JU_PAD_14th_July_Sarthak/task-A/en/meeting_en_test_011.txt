Summary:
, not always , when [PERSON12] open the link [PERSON12] is never the host . But as far as it will be over , hopefully , [PERSON12] 'm really . 

[PERSON9] guess the winter is coming and people are talking about some , the intensity of the pandemic may rise during the winter . if [PERSON9] can imagine what is the situation in India . and [PERSON9] replied  They do not report because . And people are fearing that a healthy person would get if . If [PERSON7] if [PERSON7] have something to say , maybe we could begin from that . 

[PERSON7] can do , [PERSON7] can do it myself , but if there're annotators they can do it as well . 

[PERSON7] guess we have to remove all of them . and [PERSON7] is not sure , should the letters correspond with the names that we are going to replace with real names for example . 

[PERSON12] do not [PERSON12] is not sure it is possible . if [PERSON7] want to do that , we have to create a map that maps these letters . And maybe we can correspond O and OB to [PERSON15] within the transcript . if [PERSON7] ask if [PERSON7] it will be good . And something else is that some words [PERSON7] can see that they end with this [PERSON7] do not know what [PERSON7] call it . And then the person began to say it and did not finish . 

[PERSON12] asked  , are [PERSON15] still sharing [PERSON15]'s  screen ? , in this case , it could be just removed from [PERSON7] is usually . and [PERSON12] replied  from the point of view of GDPR [PERSON12] could suppose if the word is not finished , it is not the name . 

[PERSON15] , agree with [PERSON12] that technically we are probably good with ignoring this . veverka> , [PERSON11] , , [PERSON13] , , [PERSON17] . And the third one is it depends or [PERSON15] do not know . 

[PERSON12] think they will get a list without context . 

[PERSON12] just named entities like country names . 

[PERSON12] asked  it is just should we use our system of name tag ? And [PERSON7] does not know about our name tag , he asked about Czech and named entity recognition . 

[PERSON15] do not think this is problematic . that is the way [PERSON15] see it , because it is it is there too many days . , [PERSON15] think that name tags is too fine grained for our purpose . 

[PERSON12] can copy , a few lines from this , paste it to the name tag web user interface , and it will immediately label it for [PERSON12] . The link that [PERSON12] sent [PERSON7] . All these occurrences will be automatically confirmed in the training data . What is not a named entity that will , be labeled in the whole corpus as a not a named entity like , as [PERSON7] said: this word was suspected to be a named entity. 

[PERSON7] would construct the words before that and after that . And they should say that O equals , [PERSON15] , C equals , D equals [PERSON17] , and andon . If [PERSON7] use MT five sum , that is not reversible . unintelligible>] what [PERSON15] call there . Even if it is instead of a corpus there will be some person's name . And if [PERSON15] need anything else ,then . He is like he is responding to [PERSON15] now . this is this is what [PERSON15] was discussing with [PERSON12] eehthat [PERSON15] in pairs , two people will do some test annotation . 

[PERSON2] will take twenty meetings and [PERSON9] will take twenty other meetings . 

[PERSON12] think [PERSON2] already did it . 

[PERSON12] asked  How many meetings are [PERSON2] . 

[PERSON12] have to ask [PERSON15] about the timing . 

[PERSON12] actually [PERSON12] do not even understand why should we create minutes .
