Attendees: [PERSON2], [PERSON4], [PERSON6], [PERSON7], [PERSON9]

Summary:
is not here , [PERSON9] is not sure whether he will be joining today , but maybe he will , remotely . and other than that [PERSON9] think that is that is everyone . but [PERSON4] is not sure whether [PERSON4] should talk about it , when . 

[PERSON6] do not know , other than that looking [PROJECT5] ,[PERSON7] are preparing the paper for the [PROJECT7] , [PERSON6] see . just today [PERSON4] finished the reviewer comments . 

[PERSON4] shall still need to read through it . And [PERSON4] could just briefly comment on the number of participants . 

[PERSON2] start writing the a paper just to organize the ideas . 

[PERSON2] do not know , maybe writing things , we can think about alternatives or limitations . Umfar [PERSON2] just organize the sections in bullet points . 

[PERSON9] heard that the [ORGANIZATION4] deadline has been moved , there is some extension that . But maybe [PERSON2] is wrong [PERSON2] [PERSON2] . 

[PERSON6] is really starting to write this week . let us let us tell that also to [PERSON7] , because he seems like he will not make it until Sunday , but this might help him a lot . Like that's , three more weeks , if [PERSON6] is correct . one thing that [PERSON2] need to say is that [PERSON2] . 

[PERSON9] told us about the data set that has multireference . it will be useful if [PERSON2] can access it . 

[PERSON6] asked  it is not even expected to have results for this deadline , right ? that is that is the biggest one [PERSON9] think we have . And that is if [PERSON9] is not mistaken about six hundred unique source sentences . but think about which composition of the data set is the most useful for [PERSON2] . 

[PERSON2] can check and choose the best one . because , there was a meeting last Thursday and [PERSON6] think we covered , everything we need . Or at least , [PERSON6] did not receive any email from them . but should [PERSON4] now just wait for the number of sentences ? Maybe it would be good if [PERSON9] could just [ping] [PERSON1] if they are moving , because they want this fast , but they still have not provided the people . 

[PERSON4] wrote some emails , but got no reply . 

[PERSON4] do not know , just [PERSON4] feel like [ORGANIZATION7]seriously dropped the ball this project . 

[PERSON7] and [PERSON4] are [very] frustrated . But the problem is that [PERSON5] is taking care of this and he will be leaving the project . Maybe it would be good idea to ask who is taking over , and start bothering the other person with this . maybe ask [PERSON10] to simply , have someone do the simplest thing , just to forward that those emails and get those speakers . But [PERSON6] is not sure how old that advertisement . 

[PERSON4] asked  Like what other graphs , what . 

[PERSON6] asked  It seems that [PERSON7] know , it is progressing , right ? [PERSON7] is running the back translation , monolingual data . Because [PERSON6] was killing some jobs today . as for [PERSON11]'s contribution , it is still lower and lower . if [PERSON6] need some technical help , let [PERSON6] know , [PERSON6] can probably chip in . 

[PERSON7] asked  Should it be accompanied with a paper , or it is just the demonstration ? [PERSON9] always expek a fourpage paper . 

[PERSON7] asked  , [PERSON9] is going to write to [PERSON10] , just to manage things in [ORGANIZATION7] , ? And sorry , and have [PERSON7] discussed like our capabilities of disseminating this advert . we have got that covered , we will see what [PERSON10] will , do .
