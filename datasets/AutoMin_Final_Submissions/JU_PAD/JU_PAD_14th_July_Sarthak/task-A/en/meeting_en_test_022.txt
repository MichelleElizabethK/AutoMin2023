[PERSON3] is getting bored actually now . 

[PERSON3]'s  mom is not letting [PERSON3] do anything . And [PERSON1] can answer them , it is really nice . 

[PERSON2] was looking through the task that we need to do . As specifically [PERSON2] need to do very quickly for the like for the workshop proposal . let [PERSON2] just quickly give [PERSON1] an overview . 

[PERSON2] is get to see that how it looks like to do with the [ORGANIZATION1] , website . let [PERSON2] first look into that , how does it works , to do with and something . Because [PERSON2] is not very experienced with those technologies . 

[PERSON2] have to see , but if it is , if it is tough , [PERSON2] would not do . 

[PERSON2] will start writing them here today . but [PERSON2] was requiring [PERSON1]'s  input . 

[PERSON2] will share with both of [PERSON1] a email for that we will resending to people we know and we want . 

[PERSON1] do not have any , [PERSON1] do not have any connections in this summarization field . not require , not require [PERSON1] , not require to only for summarization , ? that is requirement , but for in the website we have to show at least , [PERSON2] will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee . one could be , [PERSON1] might know someone . 

[PERSON2] think this can be done easily . It happened to us already , once with [PERSON4] now . 

[PERSON3] asked  How can [PERSON3] help [PERSON2] ? and [PERSON2] replied  [PERSON2] can also see that . 

[PERSON1] should download it does not work . What was the last information [PERSON1] . And [PERSON2] was looking at the , into some challenges of for the last year and their websites . read [PERSON2]'s  document and then we will see . And maybe [PERSON2] will also copy on to itthat he can also invite some more people into the program committee . Because , he is the person who could have know about somebody . Because , [PERSON1] know , usually in workshop , like we used to have a big organizing committee , and some people are from . and [PERSON2] think none of us are from someization background . that is , anyway , [PERSON2] did not thought making a share task would be that much challenging . , [PERSON1] that it is challenging since why [PERSON1] wasmuch unsure about making workshop that . But [PERSON2] , like [PERSON2] is mostly looking into the like publicity and the website . and [PERSON2] believe , if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization . , actually this discussion makes [PERSON1] totally frustrated . many , [PERSON2] and [PERSON4] we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community . for that , [PERSON2] will talk to [PERSON4] . 

[PERSON1] really do not know at all this earlier at all . 

[PERSON2] 'm going to ask him to be a part of the program committee because he declined to be a part of the organizing committee . if it is somebody , why not if it could be , if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic , but [PERSON1] do not know the person . 

[PERSON1] do not know who could have this talk . Actually [PERSON1] do not know about senior people for just summarization . 

[PERSON2] asked  if he is available maybe he can , would he be able to join ? [PERSON2] asked  We are going to discuss ?
