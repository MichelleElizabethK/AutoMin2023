Attendees: [A], [MU], [M], [O], [PERSON27], [PERSON7], [T]

Summary:
said that he would join us he has written [PERSON7] an hour ago , he is somewhere in the city centre , he has running in the University and she will have a very quick lunch . 

[PERSON7] think he will join in about 20 minutes or such . today [PERSON7] did send that TDID for keyboard extractor . but [PERSON29] has today written to us that this he has some TDID based on summarize . we can remove that but anyway still , it gives sentences which are not relevant , like . this is something we also noticed very early that these are some random words which are the usual word which we speak are occuring into the summarization ofthis is the biggest drawback of meeting data which needs to be handled someway . yeswe would have 3 months before the paper submission deadline . thats [O] would not see that as a big problem , increasing the quality of the shared task paper is fine if there is enough time for the submission . If the paper submission for sick dial is similar to what was our submission for the system outputs , then let lets do sick dial , but if the paper submission deadline for sick dial is earlier if its around the time as the submission deadline for interspeech . all these yellow things like committee members invited speakers submission process . 

[O] have done it for a few empty marathons several years ago . And then , in the subsequent years , it was integrated with normal like . that is a that [O] also had , but [O] do not know , either of the venues . The preparation is easier , [A]'s  just say that we want to do that and that for interspeech we have precreate the separate action . But what [O] 'm worried is that the timing of sick dial is equally bad as the interspeech special session . 

[O] agree that the people would spend two weeks working on the submissions at most in some , but they need to have three months of sitting , just like having it on their to do lists . And also , another other thing like it mayhappen that it happens in many shared task . 

[O] 'm definitely in favor of the later dead lines . 

[O] asked  Sick dial 2021 is already in June right ? that means that the deadline for papers for their . Regular papers for special session papers would be a March , and that is , the same timing here . PERSON27] of the extra work for the invited speakers that the workshop . But actually at anti marathon its the [O] know the peoplethat is the difference . at anti marathon , [O] just asked around , and actually [O] myself created the structure of what [O] would like to hear . And then , [O] like thought , what other topics ? It was easy because it was in the field that [O] know ,[T] think inviting the program committee . then we will apply for sick dial , but they also have the option of separate proceedings for sick dial . the program committee would , Choose , the , the people that they want to appear in the proceeding . the papers appearing in sick dial are ok . maybe what [O] do the same thing also for in their speech . For interspeech we could also split it paper by paperthat some papers would go to the interstate proceedings and some interest . there is an absolute strict requirement , and [O] think its , they cannot have anything against it . , interspeech , , will not get into any proceedings . yesyou want to say , , if someone does it earlier , they can send [T] interspeech . but then , then never mind if someone is working on the thing for years , then he can do it in the two weeks until the March deadline . And if someone is not working on that , then he will have the deadline for our [PROJECT11] like [O] . We have to like prepared the proposal for both . Because , it is probably bound to a person who is who is a member , a person or an institution . An infusion can take what a person can take . the part of personality is very live a for student . And in that case , the institutional is better , probably because the institutional is , [O] assume , that the institutional is kind of like for five researchers and two students , or something like that , though . these two students are for free , thats like . 

[O] would say out in general ask [PERSON96] , [PERSON96] at [ORGANIZATION2] because he is the former head of the department , and also , he knows about all the projects who are here . he would have an estimate like how many people could possibly be interested in taking part in interspeech . This is all clear at the moment , at least to [O] . Make our scientific committee like we have to now reach out to people .
