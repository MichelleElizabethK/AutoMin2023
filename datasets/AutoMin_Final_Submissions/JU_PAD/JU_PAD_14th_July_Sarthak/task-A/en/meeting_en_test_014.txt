[PERSON12] have not seen any of the subtitles in [PERSON12]'s  view of the presentation platform . PERSON9] we will still be around to fix this right . 

[PERSON1] is almost certain it is not related to that . thats something for [PERSON5] probably because we need the presentation . can [PERSON13] , can [PERSON13] comment , because [PERSON13] will [PERSON13] will be coming to the venues .

[PERSON11] will be travelling but also in [LOCATION2] is holiday . 

[PERSON12] will copy these availabilities of yours . 

[PERSON12] is not sure if [PERSON2]'s , [PERSON2] is away right . 

[PERSON12] is checking if he can connect . PERSON13] should not rely on this , like the . 

[PERSON14] says he has a problem connecting to the pexip . We are going to configure te presenation platform , English as the top priority source language since we are running test with English , but if [PERSON11] change the test , tell usthat we can put German as top priority andon , because otherwise we will not be published on the front end the subtitle . 

[PERSON12] would also like to ask everybody to keep debugging this afternon and tomorrowthat we have the workers reliable , and , . 

[PERSON12] asked  Would [PERSON6] be available for this , for all the coming days ? And what [PERSON6] would do , in the script would be [PERSON6] would know which process ID this . this ID corresponds to and [PERSON6] would kill the process and start a new process instead , that we could initiate the restart of the worker . 

[PERSON6] dont how [PERSON6] can make some kind of website available for [PERSON12] over the internet [PERSON6] dont know map our workers to session IDs , the workers know about the session ID , [PERSON6] guess they do but it might have this . We have a workers which all produce log files , we have here are actually docker container ID is and we can look this is what one of the log files looks like . can [PERSON13] tell minus F instead of this less . that the thing is , in theory this log output will indicate if this worker is in fact idle and is in fact new connection . It probably works , if [PERSON6] can avoid it [PERSON6] will not . 

[PERSON12] think it is the the matter of a would be only to recompile this worker with one print . PERSON14] if [PERSON12] could do tried this afternon , finding the source code of [PERSON12]'s  workers . Can [PERSON6] see whether [PERSON6] can ping this adress . , if [PERSON12] tell [PERSON12] [PERSON12]'s  password . that [PERSON12] would paste its adress here .
