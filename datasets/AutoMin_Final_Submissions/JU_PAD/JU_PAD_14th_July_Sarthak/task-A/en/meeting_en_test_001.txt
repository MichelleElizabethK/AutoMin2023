Summary:
Andfinally , [PERSON13] will reach [PERSON13]'s  parents . 

[PERSON5] mean [PERSON5] kept [PERSON5]'s  distance from everyone but it was green there . 

[PERSON12] have link there in the in that Google sheet we have for tricking our deliverables or stuff . for these six up coming once [PERSON5] can basically start working on them . 

[PERSON5] can [PERSON5] can enter it here and [PERSON5] will just put it into the right place . But generally , there ASR also interesting for [PERSON1] . 

[PERSON6] do not know , who should we the summarization review . 

[PERSON6] think that that [little] should be like cross reviewed between [ORGANIZATION8] and us . there is there was not any , anything like that before . 

[PERSON1] is much rather read about ASR systems . if [PERSON6] do [PERSON6] send to [PERSON5] . 

[PERSON1] do not know , [PERSON1] think we managed to avoid such a thing before . another thing is like who would like to coordinate future projects . that they would finally know what like what these EU projects are about . PERSON2] , [PERSON6] have started this [PROJECT1] test sets some time ago . 

[PERSON5] know , where the repository lives . There is another meeting happening and [PERSON6] cannot answer him now . it is and kind of assorted collection of documents in terms of languages , and like modality the speech , or the text . the file list should be essentially like [fine graph] . And year 2 empty test set and year 2 ASR test set . whether he was not all test set from [PERSON12] . for the evaluation it is for the tool , we are still working on the SLTF , which is a private repository and [PERSON6] can see it , but it will be public wants finally finalize it . but [PERSON1] mean , [PERSON1] mean how [else] do [PERSON6] . this is all is risky with the lock files , because people still can misinterpret what time stamps should they use . And this is the time when its ASR was available like printed on the screen for the user . , thethe the one people misinterpret it then someone's results can be like shifted in bad ways . that people with really live , receive the sound , and they would like in in [actual] networks sockets provide the outputs . theORGANIZATION6] people review the [PROJECT1] test set , as [PERSON6] set it up and contribute to it in any possible way . 

[PERSON9] remember that some at the several months ago of [PERSON6] suggested that [PERSON9] can ask [PERSON9]'s  students and [PERSON3] said that we cannot expect volunteers possibly paid volunteers or nonpaid volunteers that makes some different , but not to it to just do slavery task on the data . PERSON10] [PERSON10] has , for example , link to one great site of speeches and he should run by textor and they and . If [PERSON6] are under represent to [languages] . 

[PERSON1] mean , we have been playing with this and we can certainly improve the stability . 

[PERSON1] mean we only tested this simulator ASR which talking this morning about trying to get more testing the ASR . if [PERSON6] are doing retranslation [PERSON6] are never going to be up to completely make it stable without actually messing up the end performs . 

[PERSON1] mean , it is whether we see it as a priority or not . But [PERSON1] agree that way we for this . The MT only translate will be get from ASR . 

[PERSON9] think there is a lot of research right now . maybe [PERSON6] think it totally makes sense to do this guesses . 

[PERSON6]'s  question back to [PERSON16] . Maybe , actually it will not be better if [PERSON6] could even create the Doodle Poll with time slots already for [PERSON4] . 

[PERSON13] , think that probably we if [PERSON13] would like to present to the same thing we should then everything right now put the same set up without the [audition??] . Might just , [PERSON13]'s  only worry is about how to presents the results to the project officier . 

[PERSON6] asked  And a question is , what should be the material that we are that we are subtitling . 

[PERSON1] think the idea screenshare is a good one . and [PERSON9] replied  It will be next week .
