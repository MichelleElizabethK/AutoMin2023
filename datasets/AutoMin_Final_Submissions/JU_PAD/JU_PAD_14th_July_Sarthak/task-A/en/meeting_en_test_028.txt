Summary:
[PERSON7] [PERSON5] are trying to , recover from [PERSON5]'s  past , missed sessions by coming twice . And that is , [PERSON3] need to be logged into , one , of , the machines . 

[PERSON3] can , probably replay that and , see what we can do about the , recognition quality . And otherwise , what is [PERSON1]'s  , progress with other things , evaluation . right now , [PERSON3] is looking into that . how could [PERSON3] identify the files , which are too big to be uploaded to [PROJECT10] . 

[PERSON3] 'll do for one folder , and then they will do it for the rest . 

[PERSON3] was doing it now , just before this call . 

[PERSON1] asked  is , he is that the full [PROJECT2] archive ? PERSON6] and [PERSON8] , will [PERSON3] be here after the call . This is just because [PERSON6] have dentist's appointment , in one hour . if [PERSON5] could look at this would be extremely useful . let us move on to , the idea that [PERSON1] have , discussed yesterday , but [ORGANIZATION4] is not too keen on that . 

[PERSON1] hope that [PERSON3] can have a look at the paper . 

[PERSON5] suggest that , like [PERSON1] . Could [PERSON5] get in touch with [PERSON4] and process all the files that [PERSON4] has for ,[PERSON7] agreed . 

[PERSON1] do not know whether [ORGANIZATION4] can fine tune . do the , as [PERSON1] wrote in the email , do the files . and , [PERSON2] will also send [PERSON2] another [PROJECT10] repository , which we have that ,To make some [PERSON15]es in their editor and to the manual , or a revision of more conveniently . PERSON16] is the last person , mentioned in the in the in the report . 

[PERSON6] asked  do [PERSON1] want to continue . 

[PERSON4] do not know if it is relevant for others . 

[PERSON4] just , create all the recordings for the all sentences in the corpus . 

[PERSON1] asked  But can [PERSON1] do it like in a rolling buffer on the disksthat [PERSON1] would actually be training over whatever , let's . It was [PERSON4] guess how much [PERSON4] want to be played from the [PROJECT11] . And , we have , [PERSON4] guess , discussed this , earlier . and [PERSON1] replied  this also needs to be . that is everything for the most of [PERSON4] . And [PERSON6] think even in the at the beginning , we decided first to calculate C without any alignment . 

[PERSON1] do not know , that is something . 

[PERSON1] hope [PERSON6] can see [PERSON1]'s  screen now . If in German , if , for example , [PERSON1] cannot say the rest before saying there verb . 

[PERSON1] will , [PERSON1] will fix that . 

[PERSON1] have already found the answer . But [PERSON1] is confused by the numbers in here . But [PERSON6] think last time when we made . The hand calculated , and [PERSON6] think those numbers , all of them was card . 

[PERSON6] think it was based on the number of characters . If [PERSON6] apply the formula to O itself , it should obviously arrive at two , three , five . Because as [PERSON6] remember simpler calculations . Just can [PERSON1] ask if , [PERSON8] , if [PERSON6] follow ,Because [PERSON6] forgot it . 

[PERSON1] is thinking if this is simple enough to call it simple . But that is the alignment view , and "das" is not perfectly aligned to this , if [PERSON6] look at it , proportionately . The other one [PERSON1] asked [PERSON6] . And then do [PERSON6] already have access ? [PERSON6] have to click to all the emails .
