Attendees: PERSON2, PERSON4, PERSON6, PERSON7, PERSON9

 * we have a data set of very many Czech reference translations.
 * Without [PERSON7], we cannot really proceed that much with other tasks, can we talk about the possible weekly meetings for the task?
 * Let's leave it to [PERSON9], because he's the most busy person.
 * [PERSON6]: I think, yeah, if I'm correct like we got the response or [PERSON10] already wrote an e-mail to the [ORGANIZATION5] people but they, didn't reply yet, right?
 * Still we are waiting for the, [ORGANIZATION7] to actually do their part of the work and they have problems obviously to get, volunteers.
