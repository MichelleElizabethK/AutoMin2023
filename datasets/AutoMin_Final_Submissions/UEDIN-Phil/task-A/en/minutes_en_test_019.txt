 * [PERSON4]: Which is that I was using the rainbow model for paraphrasing for [PERSON10].
 * In the domain to create synthetic data, based on that, we need parallel data as much as possible.
 * We have [PERSON6] here and he is overseeing the development of the [PROJECT3].

 * [PERSON3]: Whenever [PERSON2], whenever you have the data ready, please get in touch with [PERSON7].
