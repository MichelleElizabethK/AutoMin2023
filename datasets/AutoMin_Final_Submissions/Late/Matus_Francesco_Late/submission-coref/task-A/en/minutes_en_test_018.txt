[PERSON4]can provide feedback, right?
[PERSON7] also wanted, like properly decide [ORGANIZATION3]'s or (the quality) estimation stuff, and s
W when the participants of the meeting did the, t the 2B experiment at their faculty, of participants the meeting thought that this was just going to be some introductory experiment.
It appears that u this is big paper and laugh> there's going to be no paper with [ORGANIZATION7], becaus
And the participants of meeting just thought this was going to be like small paper, bu then the big paper was to be with [ORGANIZATION7].
[PERSON9] is joining us right now and with otherâ€“noise> [PROJECT2]?
the [ORGANIZATION4] deadline is thi this Sunday.
[PERSON9] just organize th the sections in bullet points.
(PERSON1) heard that [ORGANIZATION4] deadline has been moved, uh there is some extension that th Oh really?
[PERSON7] is also starting to write t this week laugh> Uh.[ Okay let's tell that also to [PASTER7], because he seems like he will not make it until Sunday, but this might help him a lot.
[ORGANIZATION4] is N double A, [PERSON1) don't know CL laugh> (PERSON1, don'T know how to say this names yet, but it's November th the deadline].
[PROJECT6,6], the participants the meeting have a data set of very many Czech reference translations.
[PERSON7], the task of participants meeting, can the participants of the meeting talk about the possible weekly meetings for the task?
[PERSON9] was also mentioning to [PASTER1] that the daily meetings should b or daily meeting The daily reports or calls should be also beneficial in a way, that (PERSON1)'re more socialized with the rest of the team, or at least with s some people.
[PERSON7] is still not replying whether he will make it, u other_noise,> And if participants of the meeting don't have anything else to discuss, participants of meeting can probably end this call for today, right [1PERSON9]?
[PERSON9] think, yes, if (PERSON9) is correct like w participants of the meeting got the response or [ORGANIZATION5] already wrote an e-mail to the [SYMBOL5] people but they didn't reply yet, right?
(PERSON1) don't think the participants meeting need to like u urge them or p push them t for replying yet right?
Participants meeting had a meeting with [PERSON4] on Friday and also (PERSON9) would like to ask [Person4]to do the proposal how to divide the documents into these uh into the annotation like recipes again.
(PERSON9) should just wait for number of sentences?- Maybe it would be good if [PERSON1] could just (ping) [Person1] if they are moving, because they want this fast, but they still have not provided the people.
[PERSON9] told (PERSON9) that it's proceeding and that participants of the meeting are essentially waiting for them to tell us the number people and the number of segments the participants of meeting can afford.
Once Once the participants of the meeting have number of people and the number of segments in total that the participants meeting have funding for, of the participants the meeting can propose t the set documents, to discuss if the participants are fine with that
The participants of the meeting need constraints, outside constraints from them.
Lik The thing is that experiment is taking way too long and it's being suspended too long
[PERSON5] is taking care of this and he will be leaving the project an Maybe it would be good idea to ask who is taking over and start bothering the other person wit this
[PERSON10] will only say that he is starting to hire someone. th short message is something which (PERSON9) was te telling at the very beginning.
[PERSON10] has a lot of e-mails from the participants of the meeting.
[PROJECT4] is a meeting for participants of the meeting already agreed to do, the do writing and other tasks.
(PERSON9) don't know what exactly [PERSON9] should write into the paper, because the participants of meeting already had ten people do this experiment, which is five times more than what participants of the meeting already have from [ORGANIZATION7] an
[PERSON3] should have expertise in context, do it quickly.
[PERSON10] should know wh else is there, right?
[PERSON5] leaving?
[PROJECT4], [PERSON7], [PION1], (PERSON1), just do a quick update for the [PRJECT5]?
(PERSON1) is running back translation, monolingual data.
And then (PERSON1) can train the systems with this monolingual or back translated data included.
(PERSON2) think that' O or o at least to train a systems with all the data, all monolingual data just to see whether it helps or not wit with this monolingual, data included.
D do participants meeting want to participate with something, for example with [PROJECT4], or (PERSON9) don't know Like it would be nice dissemination, it would, good - [PERSON9]
