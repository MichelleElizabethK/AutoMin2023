       "\"PERSON050 : We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues.\\nPERSON051 : - (EL) Madam President, as you know, the talks in recent weeks between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, about the name to be used by the latter in its relations with all international organisations, have reached a sensitive stage. Discussions are taking place within the framework of UN decisions. During his recent visit to Skopje on 27 February, the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, referred to Greece's declared intent to place a veto on that country's NATO accession prospects if the issue of the name is not settled first. He made comments which strike an odd note for anyone upholding European principles and values. He even said that he did not favour the veto.In view of the fact that Greece has been an active, fully-fledged member of the EU for 27 years, we request that Mr Solana refrain from comments that hinder the negotiation process between a Member State and a country wishing to join NATO and the EU. We urge him to bear in mind that he represents the EU Member States, and call on him to respect their sensitivities and contribute towards resolving the issues, showing the Community solidarity that is expected of him and is his duty in view of the office he holds.(The President cut off the speaker)\\nPERSON052 : (CS) I just want to say that I am very alarmed by the attitude of some European Union politicians and Members of this Parliament towards the Czech Government's negotiations with the US regarding the visa waiver programme.Although our government has not breached a single provision of the Treaties, it has become an object of criticism, moralising and lecturing. This is spite of the fact that the negotiations took place with a country that has traditionally been a friend and ally of European democracies, not an enemy or a suspect state.Some critical comments are difficult to explain to Czech citizens who have been waiting for the United States visa waiver programme for years. Those who wish to discredit the image of the European Union in the eyes of the Czech public are free to carry on with their insensitive actions.We should all try not to bring up useless negative emotions in this case because there are no grounds for suspicion and the security of the European Union is not at risk.\\nPERSON053 : Madam President, Parma is famous for its ham and the Champagne region for its champagne, but I wonder how many colleagues here realise that Yorkshire is famous for its rhubarb. The Yorkshire rhubarb growers have applied to the European Commission to grant it protected designation of origin status, and I would urge the Commission to accede to this request.Nearly 90% of Europe's indoor-grown rhubarb was, until recently, produced in Yorkshire; that figure may have declined, but the quality has certainly not declined. The special climate of Yorkshire and the special techniques developed by generations of growers have ensured the special quality of this rhubarb, which is grown when the roots are transferred to dark sheds and the darkness means that the stalks grow up seeking light and produce a very special quality which many top chefs and the finest restaurants recognise as being an exceptional delicacy. I urge the Commission to grant them this status.\\nPERSON054 : (RO) Technical progress in the medical industry, as well as the progress made by medical schools now make it possible to achieve certain levels of performances in the treatment of patients which seemed unachievable in the past. Unfortunately, there are still many cases when medical malpractice, which could have been avoided, endangers patients' lives.Malpractice still represents a reality in many European Union countries. This phenomenon occurs mainly in many of the countries that have recently joined the European Union. Responsibility for the organisation of health services lies with the Member States, and each of the European Union countries has its own legislation on malpractice. Nevertheless, given that consumer protection and patient rights are important objectives of the European Union, I believe that we need an approach at European level, with respect to the provision of information to patients, as well as with respect to the legislation on malpractice within the European Union space.\\nPERSON055 : (PL) Madam President, Written Declaration No 88/2007 on investigating the abuse of power by large supermarkets was signed by 439 Members and officially adopted by the European Parliament.In May 2007 the Polish Parliament passed an act on the creation and operation of supermarkets that meets the demands expressed in the Declaration. In particular, the act requires local authorities on whose territory supermarkets are to be located to ensure that a balance is maintained between the various forms of trade and that the principle of fair competition in the pursuit of commercial activities is respected. The European Commission has called these measures into question and is demanding that the Polish Government change them or face referral of the matter to the Court of Justice.I would like you, Madam President, to draw the European Commission's attention to the flagrant contradiction between Parliament's expectations and the Commission's action in this matter.\\nPERSON056 : (DE) Madam President, the presidential election took place a week ago in Russia, and the result was as disappointing as we might have expected. Dmitry Medvedev won, and the losers were democracy and human rights.Three days before the election, I had a meeting with representatives of human-rights organisations in Moscow. They reported flagrant obstruction of the opposition during the electoral campaign and harassment of independent journalists and human-rights activists. Moreover, suspicions of electoral fraud cannot be dispelled.The EU should now send a very clear signal that it does not accept this conduct. Relations between the EU and Russia should be placed on a more honest footing.The same applies to relations with China, particularly as today is 10 March, the date on which, in 1959, the popular uprising in Tibet against the country's occupation by the People's Republic of China was brutally crushed.\\nPERSON057 : - (EL) Madam President, a short while ago we heard the discussion on Palestine. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worse than it has been since 1967. Currently 80% of the population, in other words about 1.1 million people, are dependent on food aid compared with 63% in 2006. Unemployment has reached 40%, according to a report by Amnesty International. We saw what happened in the area last weekend: murders were committed on both sides; there were hostilities, while the Palestinian people awaited a better tomorrow that is slow in coming.It is therefore time for the EU to assume its responsibilities and implement a policy based on objective criteria rather than dictated by Big Brother America.\\nPERSON058 : (BG) Yesterday was a day of homage in Bulgaria. March 9 is the date on which Turkish terrorists blasted the carriage for mothers with children on the Sofia - Burgas train 23 years ago. Seven people died, out of whom two were children. Another nine were badly injured.Today, one of the persons convicted for participation in the preparation of that atrocious crime, Sabri Mehmedali, is a party functionary of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. For almost two decades, this Movement, an ethnic partry existing in violation of the Bulgarian Constitution, has been using the central and local government levers, not only tolerating but also encouraging the dissemination of Islamic fundamentalism.The MRF is the only party in Europe that has erected a monument to proven terrorists who killed children. Less than two weeks ago, nine people were burnt alive in the sleeping car on the Sofia - Kardam train. There is serious evidence pointing to arson committed on the eve of the national day of 3 March. Last year, on that memorable date, Turks harassed sexually Bulgarian young people in the country called Bulgaria.The sense of impunity that the government has inspiured in the MRF instigates violence among the Turks.(The chairperson interrupts the speaker)\\nPERSON059 : (NL) May I draw the House's attention to next Thursday, 13 March, which is World Kidney Day. As you are know, chronic kidney disease is something of a silent epidemic in Europe, because its progression is often asymptomatic. Most people are not familiar with the disease and it is not seen as a priority by policy-makers. It is thought to affect 8% of Europeans, a figure that is set to double over the coming decade unless something is done about it.Last week the European Kidney Health Alliance and World Kidney Day held a symposium on the subject, with an accompanying exhibition, and I myself have set up an MEP group along with a number of colleagues. I urge all members of the House to support this initiative, because I am convinced that the European Parliament can play a leading role in encouraging Member States to act promptly to get the scale of the problem recognised and an appropriate strategy devised.\\nPERSON060 : (FR) Madam President, two legally important Council of Europe documents are ten years old: its Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. According to the Copenhagen criteria, these two documents are the criteria for membership of the European Union for the new Member States. I would urge the countries concerned that have not yet signed or ratified those two legally important documents to do so. According to the Copenhagen criteria, France, Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg cannot be members of the European Union. These European documents have to be incorporated and the European Union would have the credibility with Kosovo and new Member States to ask that ...(The President cut off the speaker)\\nPERSON061 : (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through the hunger and thirst strike that he is currently on, our colleague Marco Pannella has launched the first great 'World Satyagraha for Peace'. Satyagraha is a non-violent collective action. It is an action about which I should like to inform colleagues in writing, calling for the respect of democratically spoken words, and is emblematic not just as regards the situation in Italy.I should also like to remind you that today is the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan people's uprising against Chinese repression and to send our best wishes to the Dalai Lama and the tens of thousands of people on the march in Dharamsala, including the Radical Party leaders, Sergio d'Elia, Matteo Mecacci and Marco Perduca. We have just heard that the Indian police are taking steps to prevent the march, and for that reason as well we send them our best wishes.\\nPERSON062 : (PL) Madam President, a recent major report on child poverty in Europe showed that almost 19% of our children live below the poverty line, defined as 60% of average per capita income in a given country. There are countries in which the figure is higher. Unfortunately, Poland is one of them.I therefore welcome the European Commission's intention to propose a specific programme to combat child poverty. We are conscious of the demographic situation in the European Union. Our families need support in many ways, and poor families are in particular need of help. What, then, are we to think of the high VAT rates on children's clothing - from 7% to 22% in Poland? In some countries such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are by no means the poorest, the rate is zero, and in others, like Luxembourg, it is very low - only 3%.The governments of these countries have been very far-sighted, but there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the matter. I call on the European Parliament to take action aimed at changing the VAT Directive with respect to children's clothing and footwear.\\nPERSON063 : (PT) Madam President, A Voz do Operário, an educational and charitable society, was founded in Lisbon on 13 February 1883, and for 125 years has worked tirelessly in the fields of education, culture, partnership and social support, which I applaud. This long-standing work is continued through two schools which aim to equip hundreds of children with skills that will help them to develop, creating the conditions for them to adapt to their social environment in a critical and sustained way, on the basis of principles of justice and solidarity.This intense and recognised activity continues to this day, despite the society's current difficulties due to lack of government support because of the Ministry of Education's failure to fulfil its obligations. And this is the same Ministry that is trampling on teachers' rights, leading to the largest demonstration of teachers in Portugal - the 'March of indignation' - with 100 000 teachers, mostly ...(The President cut off the speaker)\\nPERSON064 : (GA) Mr President, as regards the increase in the number of sex offenders who are convicted in the courts of various Member States; a number of countries now have a Sex Offenders Register in operation. When a sex offender is released the police are informed of his place of residence. If he lives near a school or a youth club, for example, the police and the public should be given that information.Many offenders reoffend, especially those who do not receive treatment while in prison. However, there is nothing preventing them from committing the same crime in another country. Therefore, it is clear that a European database is necessary in order to ensure international co-operation and to help resolve this problem.\\nPERSON065 : Madam President, may I draw your attention to an issue which is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of our Parliament as well as for our political weight, both individually and collectively. I respect very much our interpreters and their difficult job. Most of them are very professional and committed. I would like to underline, however, that weak interpretation leads to misunderstanding both among us, the MEPs, and between us and the citizens.When I speak in plenary, I try to use Bulgarian as much as possible. I have this right and it is part of EU diversity and multilingualism. I use simple sentences and give the written text in advance, so that I can be sure my message gets through. However, to my surprise, I recently discovered that one third to more than half of any of my speeches simply disappears in the English version, not to mention the other languages which are used by smaller nations.I believe I speak to all citizens. I expect to be understood by all EU citizens and I cannot accept that technical issues prevent that. I kindly ask the Presidency of Parliament to take the necessary measures to improve the quality of interpretation.(The President cut off the speaker)\\nPERSON066 : (RO) Over the last months the press was informed about violent events of a racist and xenophobic nature targeted at Romanian children in Italy. Two cases caught the attention of public opinion: a 13-year old boy in Civitavecchia, near Rome, who was taken to the emergency room after being beaten by an Italian friend; In the second case, discrimination and stigmatisation are even more obvious, going as far as a Romanian mother being requested the change of her son's name. The child no longer wants to be a Romanian or to hear of Romania. The reason for such behaviour lies with the fact that the boy was permanently insulted by his friends for being a Romanian, despite the fact that he speaks Italian and he has integrated well into society. Honourable President, that is why I ask myself whether all these forms of xenophobia with effects on Romanian children are the result of a media campaign against Romanians; within the meaning of the fundamental principles ...\\nPERSON067 : (PL) Madam President, at the present time opinions are being canvassed in the European Union concerning changes to the Fruit Juice Directive, 2001/112/EC. The powerful citric acid producers lobby wants it to be legally possible to increase the acidity of fruit juices and their ingredients, including apple juice, by adding citric acid, lemon juice and lime juice.Such a possibility would infringe the principle of fair competition and wipe out European fruit juices, including apple juice. So the question is: why do the EU authorities so often give in to pressure from lobbying groups and, in the event of further surrender, what measures will be taken to protect producers of apples and apple preserves?May I remind you that, in the vote on reform of the fruit and vegetable market, the European Parliament rejected an amendment tabled by a group of Polish Members aimed at introducing protective measures for apples. In these circumstances, acceptance of the proposal to allow additional acidification of fruit juices, including apple juice, with citric acid would be a huge injustice and a blow to the European fruit farming sector.\\nPERSON068 : Madam President, in accordance with the challenge of the EU development cooperation policy for the new Member States, I shall focus on the national strategy for education in Romania.Even before my country's integration into the EU, the national strategy for education in Romania was focused on making the system compatible with existing systems in the other EU countries. Therefore, in 2004 we started the Bologna reforms, and a three-year degree structure has been in use since the academic year 2005-2006. Recent surveys show that the acceptance of the European credit transfer system (ECTS) is now complete, and students in Romania are already following the new system. For the future, we plan to finish successfully the implementation of the Bologna reforms, in order to encourage Romanian students to study abroad and foreign students to study in Romania, and to make sure that the degrees awarded by the universities are in accordance with the needs of the labour market in Europe.\\nPERSON069 : (ET) Colleagues, Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe. Conditions there are no different from life behind the iron curtain, which many colleagues in this Chamber experienced personally.I remember the yearning for freedom which most Estonians felt; and Finnish radio and television helped North Estonia maintain that yearning, along with Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. All Belarusians need this kind of window on the world.On 10 December, human rights day, the television satellite Belsat began broadcasting in Poland, its mission is to make Belarus a community of citizens. The most important partners of the station, which operates in Belarusian and Russian, are the journalists of Belarus fighting for democracy. The ten per cent of Belarusians who have satellite dishes can currently watch the broadcasts.The station is backed by Poland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and the USA. Good television, my friends, cannot be made on the cheap. Because of this I ask both the European Commission and all Member States to support Belsat financially. I see it as our bounden duty as democracies.\\nPERSON070 : Madam President, a few days ago presidential elections were held in the Republic of Cyprus. The voters demonstrated their wish for a speedy solution to the Cyprus problem by electing a moderate politician, Mr Christofias, and by ousting Mr Papadopoulos who was considered by many to be a hardliner and nationalist. This important change is further proof that the Greek Cypriots genuinely want a resolution of the long-lasting conflict with the Turkish Cypriots and with Turkey, which is occupying 40% of the island.The Greek Cypriots have made a very brave move by showing moderation and compromise but in order for things to move forward Turkey must now reciprocate with an appropriate goodwill move such as the return of the ghost city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants or the withdrawal of a significant number of Turkish troops of occupation from the island.\\nPERSON071 : Madam President, I wish to raise the Treaty debate which is taking place in Ireland at the moment.I think it is simply outrageous that Sinn Féin and its leader, Gerry Adams, are claiming in this debate that if you were to vote 'yes' to the Treaty, it will mean that Ireland will be engaging with NATO and will lose its neutrality.Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a triple-lock safety net there to make sure that this cannot happen. They have said the same thing during the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties and it has always proven to be false on every single occasion.They have opposed every treaty since 1972; yet they claim they are pro-European. If you are 'pro-' something, you do not oppose it every single time. Recently, in his speech to the Ard-Fheis, Gerry Adams never mentioned the EUR 1.65 billion that the EU has given to the peace process on the island of Ireland. I think it is only fair that somebody who says he is pro-Europe should recognise the work that this Union has done to improve the peace process on the island of Ireland.If you are pro-Europe, you prove that you are pro-Europe and you do not put out outrageous allegations on this Treaty that are not true.\\nPERSON072 : (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, over the past few days two events have drawn our attention once again to the need for a common European energy policy. On the one hand, Russia has again significantly cut the amount of gas it supplies to Ukraine, thereby seriously endangering Europe's energy security. On the other, Gazprom and the Hungarian government have entered into an agreement on the Hungarian section of the South Stream pipeline, an agreement incompatible with current European Union provisions. The lesson to be learned from these two events is clear: although Russia can be considered less and less of a partner in energy matters, the European Union's dependence on Russia is steadily growing. This dependence is going to result in a deterioration in energy supply security and ultimately to an increase in prices. To avoid this happening and to ensure that we can guarantee European consumers a secure supply at a reasonable price, the European Union needs to speak with one voice. It is not yet too late to strengthen the foundations of a common European energy policy based on solidarity. Thank you.\\nPERSON073 : Madam President, I rise to draw your attention to the problems being experienced in the south-east of England in consequence of the industrial action taken in the French cross-Channel shipping industry on the Dover-to-Calais route. For many years this vital link in the trans-European network has been an inefficient bottleneck. Perhaps that is understandable when it is caused by bad weather or technical problems, but on this occasion - for over two weeks now - the whole economy of this region has been held an innocent hostage in this dispute.I ask that the Presidency prevail upon the European Commission and the two respective governments to ensure that the principle of free movement of goods and people throughout the European Union is upheld. I also ask that in the longer term they bring pressure to bear so that far greater urgency can be applied to finding long-term solutions to this problem, which brings so much hardship to our region.\\nPERSON074 : (BG) Mme Chairperson, Colleagues, I would like to once again draw your attention to the proper and efficient use of the EU financial resources.The reports adopted at the previous session and the debates on them clearly define some key outstanding issues of the existing system.Unfortunately the media and the general public continue the debate on the inability of some of the old Member States, as well as the new Member States, including my country Bulgaria, to apply the European standards sufficiently well and to protect the EU financial interests.It is also obvious that there is a lack of an effective preventive policy aimed at preventing irregularities and violations in the disbursement and absorption of financial resources. The events over the recent weeks, in which the European Commission has discontinued the resources under the PHARE and SAPARD Programmes for Bulgaria, are a further testimony to the fact that most of the irregularities in the spending of these resources are associated also with corrupt practices.In this connection, I believe that the European Parliament's mechanisms should be strengthened and we should insist on monitoring of the implementation before the European Commission.(The chairperson interrupts the speaker)\\nPERSON075 : (PL) Madam President, last month I wrote to the European Commission asking it to halt examination of the Republic of Poland's request for restructuring aid for Krajowa Spółka Cukrowa (Poland's national sugar company), reject the application and initiate control proceedings. My letter had the support of 35 MEPs from various countries and political groups. In connection with the grant of restructuring aid, Krajowa Spółka Cukrowa intends to close the Lublin sugar plant and demolish all the buildings.In the opinion of the plant's staff and protest committee, which has also written to the European Commission and the European Parliament Committee on Petitions, the preparation and examination of Poland's application contravened Community rules. We still await a response from the European Commission.I am drawing the European Parliament's attention to this specific problem because ...(The President cut off the speaker)\\nPERSON076 : (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have often discussed here whether the Olympic Games in Beijing will improve or worsen the general human-rights situation in China. That is a fairly contentious point. What seems certain, as far as I can see, is that these Games will have a disastrous effect on animal welfare in China. I read today that there were plans to kill 200 000 cats in Beijing by caging them, starving them, letting them die of thirst or simply poisoning them on the grounds that some guests might object to the presence of cats. This is something that cannot be tolerated.I believe people should think twice whether they really want to be spectators at these Games. Athletes should think twice whether they ought to take part in these Games, and organisers should think twice about the wisdom of their decision to award the Games to China. We need have no second thoughts, however, about you, Madam President, being able to express the disapproval of this House.(The President cut off the speaker.)\\nPERSON077 : (PT) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the 100 000 Portuguese teachers who demonstrated in an impressive and imposing 'March of indignation' in Lisbon on 8 March last, organised by the Portuguese National Teachers' Federation.In response to an offensive promoted by the Socialist Party Government against teachers' rights, democratic school management and state education, the teachers reaffirmed their determination to fight for dignity, employment, teachers' rights and improved conditions, and to protect high-quality teaching and state education in Portugal.\\nPERSON078 : (SK) In Slovakia on 25 March we will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Candle Demonstration for religious and civil rights and freedoms.The Communist regime violently broke up this peaceful gathering of religious believers. This was a serious breach of civil rights and of the freedom of assembly, guaranteed by the Constitution, by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by the Helsinki Final Act (1975).Although the Candle Demonstration was held at the initiative of religious believers, it expressed the desire for respect for human rights of all citizens. Its roots were in religious and civil dissent, in the sacrifices of people who were executed, in the suffering of unjustly imprisoned people and in the Pontificate of John Paul II. Because of people's courage to revolt, the Candle Demonstration in Bratislava in March 1988 can be considered the beginning of the end of communist totality in Czechoslovakia that finally reached its culmination in November 1989.\\nPERSON079 : (BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to the Suhodol case, the environmental disaster for the Bulgarian capital cirty, affecting directly the health and life of millions of people.In December 2007, the citizens affected by the unregulated landfill in the area of Suhodol sent a petition to the President of the European Parliament, after the landfill, which had been closed at a decision of the Ministry of the Environment and Water in 2005, was re-oepened with the intervention of over 2,500 police and gendarmerie officers on 4 December 2007. The affected persons invoked the Aarhus Convention which has been ratified by the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria.The Sofia City, unlawfully supported by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria, has acted without the mandatory environmental impact assessment by the Ministry of the Environment and Water and without subsequent hearings of the affected population. Furthermore, the Sofia City, again unlawfully suppoorted by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria, has carried out activities for which no enforceable judgment is in place.I would kindly request you, with a view to terminating the biological terrorism, that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Petitions...(The chairperson interrupts the speaker)\\nPERSON080 : We have to stop now, because we have gone well beyond thirty minutes.That concludes the item.\""

I belong to the generation of Spaniards who, with Europe on the horizon, played a leading role in the transition to democracy, and at a very young age we took on important political responsibilities. Councillor and trade union delegate, Member of Parliament for eighteen years, five as Chairman of the Committee on European Affairs and twelve as Minister or Secretary of State, and then candidate for Prime Minister. I have also been a member of the Convention, and for ten years in a row I have represented my country in different formations of the Council. I lost battles there which were then won in Parliament, from its position closer to the citizens.I can say that I have good knowledge of the functioning of the Community institutions, but for me Europe is more than a political experiment, it is a vital project. I am as European as I am Spanish and ‘ [I am also Catalan]’, but I am neither of the old nor of the new Europe. I am simply a European who rejects denominations intended to perpetuate our division. At some point we have all been new Members of the Union and, from Vilnius to Lisbon, or from Edinburgh to Athens, we are all of the same Europe.Reunification put an end to the tragic inheritance of Hitler and Stalin, but there is still much for us to do in order to make it effective. It will put our solidarity to the test and require us to respect the most diverse of opinions. As President of the European Parliament I shall ensure that it operates correctly within a more complex linguistic context.Ladies and gentlemen, we must eliminate any grey areas which harm the image of this Parliament. We need a Statute so that the Members of all the countries can carry out their duties under the same conditions of transparency, dignity and efficiency. I will therefore begin by being demanding in our relations with the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, over the next few years, this Parliament will be standing at the crossroads of history. We have reached it by means of the path of success. The centuries-old enemies of yesterday are now the world’s most cooperative neighbours, but today the European project is suffering the threefold problem of size, efficiency and legitimacy, for which the Constitution – to which I contributed – provides the best solution we have. Without it we would be, for a very long time, nothing but a big market. And, if Europe abandons its political ambitions, the world will suffer the destructive confrontation between materialism on the one hand and fundamentalism on the other.I will therefore be calling on all Members of Parliament to participate in the great task of ratifying the Constitution. That will be a great moment for this Parliament: to talk to the Europeans about Europe, to convince them that ours is a living project, with soul, although it is inevitably a complex one, which has an effect on the problems that concern them most, such as employment and security, terrorism and migration, problems which cannot be resolved without European integration.We must project the image of this institution towards the citizens we represent, making our message intelligible. In a Europe with an unemployment rate of 9% and with 50 million poor people, we must convince our citizens of the importance that Community policies, the Lisbon strategy and the Gothenburg environmental dimension have on cohesion and competitiveness, which we believe to be complementary rather than the contradictory.Ladies and gentlemen, we all want a President of Parliament who is close and accessible, but their role is not that of a Head of Government who applies a party political programme. The President must have solid support and play the role of strategically promoting the institution they represent. I am very aware of this. If I am elected, I will represent the diversity of Parliament and firmly promote its role in relation to the other Community institutions.I will end with a message of optimism: Europe is a long-term project and its path is made by walking. The crises awaiting us will not be any more serious than the ones we have already overcome. We must and we can mobilise the peoples of Europe to write a new page in our history in peace and therefore, and to this end, I would ask you to vote for my candidature as President of the European Parliament. Thank you very much.\\nPERSON7 :    – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are all aware of the history of my homeland. It has played a leading role in all the dramatic events of the twentieth century. My country, Poland, was also the birthplace of the revolt against totalitarianism, a revolt that made the unification of Europe possible. As a result, this House is now one of the institutions of a Europe that is drawing closer together. I come from Central Europe. Poland and all the other countries in this region shared a common fate. Our freedom and independence were threatened on a daily basis, and we feared for the future. Nonetheless, we won through. We are now free and independent nations. Such is the background from which I come before this House.Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you are familiar with my past, and that you know how I came to be what I am today. I have friends across the whole spectrum of political groupings represented in this House. With that in mind, I should like to make the following statement. It was exceedingly fortunate for Europe that we were not left alone to fight for our freedom. We were able to count on the support of all those who believed in their hearts and minds that Europe had to be free. You will recall that Martin Luther King said it is impossible to engage in politics without first having a dream.As I come before this House, I too have a dream. My dream is of a Europe of solidarity. Incidentally, Poland was responsible for bringing the word 'solidarity' into our political vocabulary. As I said, I have a dream of a Europe of solidarity and justice. This House is an institution for such a Europe. Having described how I came to be what I am today, I should like to move on to explain what I would like to become, and why I am standing as a candidate for President of the European Parliament.My ambition is to serve a Europe that grows ever more united. I hope to serve it as a representative of that part of Europe kept apart from the rest for half a century against its will. I hope also to serve it as a representative of a Europe credited with one of the greatest achievements of the twentieth century, namely the creation of the European Union.It is my ambition too for Parliament to become a forum for debate. There are Euroenthusiasts, Eurosceptics and Eurorealists in this House, just as there are in societies across Europe. Nonetheless, I hope the House will become a forum for a strategic debate on the future of Europe. It is important for Parliament to fulfil its political role and succeed in bringing together political groupings with differing programmes. These groupings competed against each other in the elections, but it is now time for them to join forces in the House in order to build a united Europe.Allow me to emphasise once again that my aim is for this House to become a forum for strategic debate. I trust that, like the Union itself, it will become a community of nation states and citizens, because Europe owes its greatness to its nations. We need to learn to live together if we are to fulfil our role.Finally, I aspire to become President of a fine and great European Union institution. The Union is one of the greatest democracies in the world. This institution is itself capable of being free and democratic. I stand before you, Members of this House, and appeal to you to have confidence in me and cast your votes in my favour. If you do, yours will certainly be a vote for Europe!\\nPERSON8 :     Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the election of the President of our Parliament constitutes our first political act of this new term of office. What clear and coherent message are we going to deliver to our fellow citizens on this occasion?The question is an important one, given the extent to which the public image of the European institutions has become confused, if not suspect, and with good cause: how are people to find their way around the issue when, for all these years, votes from the left and right have systematically combined to administer the liberal economic model, or when Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, like their supporters in this House, have combined their efforts to support George W. Bush in his military adventure.As many of us said during the recent election campaign, the moment has come to put an end to these confused identities and to make the divisions between progressives and conservatives visible and comprehensible.My candidacy has no objective other than that of being faithful to this commitment. In the first round of this highly symbolic election, it offers all left-wing MEPs the opportunity to express their disagreement with unnatural arrangements, whether they be traditional ones, such as that linking the Group of the Party of European Socialists to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or less expected but no less pernicious arrangements, like that which at present links the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.In the second round – if second round there be – the vast majority of my group will adopt an attitude in keeping with the adage: in the first round, you choose; in the second, you eliminate.We respect Mr Geremek as an eminent European intellectual, and we recognise the importance of the role he played as a political player during a crucial period in the history of our continent. We cannot, however, support his candidacy when it comes either to the very orthodox options he perceives in economic and social matters – options we believe are at the heart of the disaffection demonstrated by our fellow citizens at the last elections, both in the old Member States and still more so in the new ones – or when it comes to his positions on the war in Iraq, which is, for us, the symbolic issue.I would point out that Mr Geremek – who, I am not embarrassed to say, usually has the courage of his convictions – has embraced the logic of the Vilnius Ten’s manifesto, whereas the left in the European Parliament has, for its part, sided with public opinion, the majority of which, unlike Madrid in Warsaw, aspired to a political solution under the aegis of the United Nations.In our view, the attitude adopted to the war is even more than an issue of political etiquette. That is the way it is. The former group chairmen will remember the proposal I made that the latest Sakharov Prize be awarded to a liberal politician, Mr Hans Blix, who, above and beyond the political choices he perceived, symbolised this other way for which we hoped and prayed.With the exception of three MEPs, who have stated that they will abstain, my group will therefore transfer its votes to Mr Josep Borrell in the second round of this ballot. Although our choice can of course be criticised, neither its coherence nor its clarity can be disputed. That too is what democracy is about.\\nPERSON9 :    – Thank you to the three speakers for what they said and for not having exceeded their speaking time. We shall now proceed to the election. \\nPERSON10 : \\nPERSON11 :    – I announce the result of the ballot to elect the President.Number of voters: 700Blank or spoiled ballot papers: 53Votes cast: 647Absolute majority for election in this ballot: 324The votes cast for each candidate are as follows:José Borrell Fontelles: 388 votesBronisław Geremek: 208 votesFrancis Wurtz: 51 votesJosé Borrell Fontelles has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast and is therefore elected President of Parliament. \\nPERSON12 : Mr Borrell, I congratulate you on your election and I would invite you to take your rightful place on the presidential chair.\\nPERSON13 : \\nPERSON14 :    Ladies and gentlemen, my first words as President of the European Parliament must be words of gratitude; also of commitment and looking to the future but, above all, words of gratitude.Firstly, to the Oldest Member, Mr Berlinguer, for the way he has led our first parliamentary sitting of this term in office ...... and, secondly, to the candidates who have offered their abilities and their will to serve Europe as President of this Parliament.I am sure that I will be able to cooperate in an honest and positive way with all of them, taking advantage of the huge political experience in this Parliament of Mr Wurtz, and of Mr Gueremek, in terms of the events which have modelled our Europe.I must express my respect for, and my desire to cooperate with, those Members who, for whatever reason, have not voted for me, and my gratitude to all of those who have put their trust in me, beginning with the Group of the European Socialist Party who proposed my candidature.The majority I have received gives stability to this institution and, following the debate and the democratic decision made, I now feel that I have all the legitimacy I need to direct the work of this Parliament and I would call on you all from now on to work effectively.I would like to pay tribute to our former President, Mr Pat Cox, for the way in which he has carried out his duties over the last thirty months.His has been a brilliant presidency, respectful of all groups and all Members, very active in seeing through the process of European reunification and constantly mindful of the political visibility of this Parliament. The very existence of the Convention and the impetus Parliament gave to its work is due, to a large extent, to the will demonstrated by Pat Cox to move the Union away from its inter-governmental tendency and make Parliament, as now expressly acknowledged in the draft Constitution, the representative of the European citizens.I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of Parliament of all countries who represented our Parliament in the work of the Convention for their work. I know from my own experience how important their contribution was and, though I cannot mention them all by name, I will refer in particular to the important role played by those who represented us in the Praesidium, Mr Klaus Hänsch and Mr Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, and also Mr Elmar Brok, who followed the Intergovernmental Conference.Finally, as President of this Parliament, I would like in particular to welcome the Members representing the ten new Member States, and I hope that soon Members from Romania and Bulgaria will also join us and thereby put an end, in the words of Milan Kundera, to the kidnap of half of the West.While quoting that great European writer, I would like to remind you that in the film version of 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being', the roofs and cupolas we believe to be Prague are in fact those of Lyon, firm proof of the common identity shared by the two halves of an area which has inherited the same culture.So, at what for me is a highly emotional time, I feel that democracy is not just a system of political organisation based on institutions elected by the citizens. It is based – in particular ours, a plurinational and therefore more complex one – on an idea of Man which came before systems of government.Aware of my enormous responsibility from this point on, in which passion for democracy and passion for Europe come together in one single challenge, I wish to leave the explanation of my strategic outlook for this term of office for the next plenary sittings after the summer.I believe this is best for two reasons: firstly, because we must have the time and the opportunity to exchange impressions and to draw up this strategic vision together with the Vice-Presidents, when they are elected, and with the leaders of the political groups. We must all contribute to a vision which is not just of the President, but of the whole House.Secondly, the President of the Council is here today and in a few hours time we will hear from the candidate proposed by the Council as President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who will be subject to vote by Parliament, and I believe we need a better window of opportunity in terms of media attention than we have at the moment with so many other events taking place.As I said to you in my presentation, it is my political responsibility to do everything I can to ensure that the European Parliament is involved in the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty, particularly in the countries which are going to do so by means of a referendum. We are all aware that, apart from this great issue, our agenda is already overflowing with matters we must deal with: the new Commission, initiating working relations with it and with the Council, examining the Union’s financial perspectives, analysing the situation of the Stability and Growth Pact following the recent failure of the Court of Justice, future enlargements, implementing the new legislative powers of this Parliament and continuing the work of Pat Cox in cooperation with national parliaments and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.Furthermore, many international issues will demand our attention. The world will knock on Europe’s door and particularly on Parliament’s door. Perhaps the most urgent issues are those relating to the dramatic situation in the Middle East.Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members of the European Parliament, it only remains for me to assure you that I will apply all my will and all my abilities, all my reason and all my passion, that I may be a match for the high institutional and strategic position you have entrusted to me.I would like finally to thank all the workers in this institution without whose work we would not be able to carry out our own.Thank you very much to all of you.\\nPERSON15 :    . – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I offer my most sincere congratulations to President Borrell Fontelles on his election. His previous experience is a guarantee of a useful and fruitful presidency. This is a great undertaking, since the President has to direct the work of an institution which, precisely because it has been directly elected, will be affected more than the others by enlargement, by the approval of the Constitution and by the great international tensions that are rocking the world today. This House will be a place of debate and decision even more than it has been in the past, and it must ensure that the citizens of Europe can play an ever greater democratic role.I just want to stress that this Parliament has elected its new President at an extraordinary juncture. We have seen how complex our constitutional reform has been, as it was approved only a few weeks ago after heated and difficult debate. The result was not a foregone conclusion at all and I welcome it enthusiastically, but it has also created a decisive role for Parliament in the campaign for ratification, which is to start straight away and will be one of the most difficult tasks ahead of us.Let me now recall our enlargement, another unquestionable success for the Union. Tough negotiations in which our common interests prevailed have enabled 25 countries to share their hopes for the future.I also recall – and with less satisfaction – the low turnout of voters in the European elections. Even though all the opinion polls show that Europe is considered to be increasingly necessary in order to face up to our great challenges, we are still faced with the need to bring the institutions closer to the daily lives of Europe’s citizens. This is one of Parliament’s foremost tasks.As happened during the last term, the Commission and the European Parliament are collaborating closely so that our common interests can prevail; this is one reason for this alliance, which in formal terms is reflected in the European Parliament’s vote of confidence in the President of the Commission. My Commission has made every effort to develop this collaboration, thanks also to the framework agreement and the daily work of implementing it. Once again, I thank President Cox for having been a fully cooperative and open partner. The results of our work on codecision and in other areas are exceptional and unprecedented, and I am sure that this collaboration will continue with the new Commission, which will be called upon to consolidate this year’s results and to develop them further. Together, the Commission and Parliament must impart fresh impetus to the European integration process, with the fundamental objective of continuing along the path towards enlargement and the Constitution.Mr President, please allow me to say a last word of thanks to your institution, with which I have worked for five years. Without Parliament’s stimulus, without its checks and without its in-depth political debate, even though it may be harsh at times, we would certainly not have achieved this enormous volume of work. These have been years of major results, which have been transformed into concrete benefits for the people and stronger hopes for our common future. Mr President, I wish you and the new Parliament all the best in your work. \\nPERSON16 :    – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President, are now the elected President of the European Parliament and of all its Members. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to extend to you heartfelt congratulations and to wish you success in your office as President of Parliament, for success for you is success for us all.I would like to express warm respect and high regard for Mr Geremek, whose life’s achievements I personally hold in the highest estimation – as does our group – and thank him for what he has done for Poland and for Europe.I would also, though, like to testify to the respect I have for Mr Wurtz, even though I have no sympathy whatever with what he had to say in his speech today. Mr Wurtz, you are always, however, an honest partner to have, including in the Conference of Presidents, and I have personal regard for you. I believe that it will be to this House’s benefit if we continue to work together in a spirit of mutual trust despite all our political differences.Further to that, let me observe that no group, not even the largest – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has 268 MEPs – holds a majority in the European Parliament. Experience tells us that it is quite normal, a quite normal political activity, to seek out majorities in such a situation. In the last Parliament, which sat from 1999 to 2004, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to an agreement with the Liberals, with Mr Watson, with whom I have generally worked well, and I hope that I will continue to do so in future. My friends, Parliament would, however, be somewhat out of balance if one Liberal were now to be succeeded by another, and if the second-largest group in this House were to be kept out of the Presidential office for at least twelve-and-a-half years. For that reason, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have come to this agreement with the Socialist Group, and we have given you our support.Let me make, if I may, a final observation. We in this European Parliament – and I see that Mr Prodi is here, to whom we, as a rule, gave our support, even though that was sometimes very difficult – have a great interest in the stability of the European institutions, and so I appeal to everyone, now that we have taken this decision today, to vote on Thursday for José Manuel Durão Barroso and thereby to demonstrate that we seek stability for the European Commission too.The last thing I have to say to you is that, in this House, issues of policy will continue to be the subject of tough debate between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialists and others. The issues will still be there, and will still be bones of contention, but it is important that the institutions be stable. What joins us together and unites us is our defence of democracy, our defence of the rule of law, our commitment to solidarity and peace in our continent as it comes together as one. That is our common task, and in that, Mr President, I wish you success with all my heart. \\nPERSON17 :    – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even in the lives of Parliamentary groups there are great days, and, for ours, today is one of them. It is only right, in the hour of triumph, to think of those who do not share in it, so let me address the opposing candidates, such as you, Mr Geremek. Even though we voted for our own candidate rather than for you, I think I speak on behalf of all the Socialist Members of this House when I say how proud I am to be able to work together with you, and that your membership of this House does it honour.The only thing to be said about Mr Wurtz, in fact, is that we agree 100% with what he had to say about President Bush’s policies.That, unfortunately, was not enough to make us give him our votes, but I thank him warmly for his cooperation, which is always excellent and constructive. I have nothing to add, in this speech, to Mr Poettering’s description of him.To you, Mr Borrell, our President and our colleague, I wish three things: firstly that you may actually do what you have undertaken to do in the conduct of your office. Such an office is always bound up with many burdens, some of them personal. From the depths of my heart I wish you the capacity to bear and endure those burdens you have taken on.Secondly, let me observe that you no longer preside over the Social Democrats, but over all the Members of this House. You have my assurance that, when you have to take decisions in this capacity, we – even if we as Social Democrats are perhaps unable to support them in detail – will always faithfully obey them, coming as they do from a President of the whole House who is one of our own.Thirdly, let me say that we are proud that, after ten years, a Social Democrat – and what a Social Democrat – again presides over this House. My dear Josep Borrell, you have our best wishes, and let me say to you, our President, that I am sure that you will be as outstanding a political figure in Europe as you have been in Spain. All the best and congratulations!\\nPERSON18 :    – Mr President, I should like to add my words to those of my colleagues Mr Poettering and Mr Schulz in thanking all the contestants in this competition for the Presidency of our House.The result that we have is an honourable one. I am proud that the political family I represent gave the European Parliament a first-class President in Pat Cox. I believe that he will be a hard act to follow and I wish you, Mr President, all the best in your term of office.I would, however, like to put on notice the Group of the European People's Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I believe that the alliance they have formed is an unnatural one. Such an alliance, when it happens in national parliaments, happens only at times of war or crisis. If these parties try to use this alliance to carve up the way things are done in this House, my group will fight them every inch of the way. If they conspire to block the necessary reforms in this House, we will stand up for the interests of the citizen. I believe that the citizens of the European Union are fed up with opaque government and back-room deals and look forward to the day when we have a mature Parliament, building a political majority not a technical majority.Mr Poettering spoke of the need for stability. The trouble is that democracies are run by crisis management: serious problems are not tackled until they have to be. Our Union has problems and resolving those problems will require leadership. We will judge you, Mr President, on your capacity for showing leadership to this House in the period to come.\\nPERSON19 :    Mr Watson, you may rest assured that the Presidency will ensure that the rights of all the groups are fully respected. \\nPERSON20 :    – Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also congratulates you on this election, even though, as you know, the majority of my group chose another candidate, Mr Geremek, who represents this new Europe that we are creating today. You can, however, be sure of the collaboration and loyalty with which our group will be ready to work with you over the coming years, as it has worked with the other presidents before you.We had offered your group a different alliance, one which in our view was possible and could have had a majority in this Parliament. We think the question of stability is indeed much less important than the transparency of the political agreements that are made and also the transparency of the laws we are to make as the European Parliament. We therefore truly hope that today will be the last time that this vote and this unnatural alliance are seen here, because otherwise it will not be at all easy for citizens to recognise their Parliament as a body that openly conducts European politics in a clear, definite and specific manner and thus reflects their choices and their political views.Mr President, we consider that what Mr Hans-Gert Poettering has said about President Barroso is rather worrying and we think it would be interesting for the whole of this House to learn what the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is going to do about the election of President Barroso and whether that too really is part of a package, as was hoped. Mr President, we believe that it is only through succeeding in creating majorities about issues, about what the citizens are really demanding, clearly and not through ambiguous, opaque alliances, that this Parliament can be respected and European democracy can really work for all its citizens. I thank you and wish you all the best in your work. \\nPERSON21 :    – Mr President, I wish, in my turn, to express my group’s congratulations to Mr Borrell on his election.I said just now what I thought of the context of this election; I was critical of it. I want now to say what I think of Mr Borrell; by way of complete contrast, I greatly admire him. I admire him for his left-wing commitment on what, in our view, are crucial issues at stake, particularly in the international sphere. I also admire him for his ear for dialogue and for the importance he attaches to warm relationships. That also matters, including in political life.I am sure that my group and I shall be able to cooperate constructively with him as our new President.It remains for me to express my respect for Mr Geremek and to thank Mr Poettering and Mr Schultz most sincerely for what they said about me. May we transcend our differences and divisions and, throughout the life of this Parliament, give full sway to this spirit of tolerance and mutual respect. I think that, in the process, there would be no loss to democracy and that much would be gained in terms of human relations.\\nPERSON22 :    – Mr President, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is working within Europe to build a common commitment that will take us away from preconceived ideas. We believe we should all collaborate to strengthen a Europe that is free of terrorism, discrimination and monopolistic temptations, whether in the economic sphere or in politics or culture. It is therefore vital that you should be President of the whole of Parliament and that Parliament should find a more effective way of bringing the people closer to our institutions and having them take part in our decisions. Mr President, to bring the people closer to Europe and Europe closer to the people, we must declare here in this House that it is our common commitment, within a context of mutual respect, to find a way to provide full and correct information at last. The work of Parliament is all too often insufficiently understood in our own countries.Mr President, as I give you and this House my best wishes for your future work, allow me on behalf of my group to offer my esteem and friendship to Mr Geremek and to recall once more the example he has set and still sets for all of us and the whole of Europe. \\nPERSON23 :    – Mr President, having expressed our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr Cox, we wish, in accordance with the forms and courtesies of this House, in turn to offer you our sincere congratulations on your election.These are, of course, congratulations that are offered not so much out of political considerations as to you, yourself, since, as has become apparent, this election is, as much as anything, fairly symbolic of the basic agreement that exists between the two main groups in this House, over and above the differences of opinion that, all in all, are relatively superficial.As a number of previous speakers have said, we hope you will defend the rights of all MEPs, including those who are at present in minorities and who, as has happened to certain other minorities in history, will perhaps be the majorities of tomorrow. They will include MEPs who, as they have every right to do, share their electorate’s unshakeable hostility towards the way in which our institutions are currently developing and who are resolved to defend the identity and fundamental freedoms of their respective nations. They will include MEPs whom, following the pattern in previous terms of office, hostile governments wish to strip of their mandates because of what they have said or because of their protests against the persecutions to which they are subject. They will include MEPs who do not belong to groups and who, although much larger in number than the members of certain groups and although representing no less than eight or ten nationalities, do not have a single interpreter, in French or English for example, at their work meetings – a form of discrimination that, during the previous Parliament, the Court of Justice had occasion to condemn in principle.In a word, we hope that you will be a President for all MEPs and ensure that the principle is respected whereby, in this Parliament, all MEPs are fully-fledged MEPs, whatever their opinions.\\nPERSON24 :    Mr Gollnisch, please rest assured that I will do so.(1)\\nPERSON25 : \\nPERSON26 :    The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament(1).I have received the following candidatures: Mr Luigi Cocilovo, Mr António Costa, Mr Ingo Friedrich, Mrs Silvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, Mr Edward McMillan-Scott, Mr Mario Mauro, Mr Pierre Moscovici, Mr Gérard Onesta, Mr Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Mr Miroslav Ouzký, Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, Mr Jacek Emil Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Antonios Trakatellis and Mr Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca. The candidates have informed me that they accept their candidature and, given that the number of candidates does not exceed the number of posts to be filled, I propose that the election be by acclamation, in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure.I therefore declare the candidates I have just named to be Vice-Presidents-elect of the European Parliament and I congratulate them on this election.We shall now establish the order of precedence for the Vice-Presidents. \\nPERSON27 :    – Just one question, Mr President: is there a minimum number that have to have a cross against them for the voting paper to be valid? Again, is there a minimum number of names that have to have a cross put against them in order for the voting paper to be valid, or is it valid if you put a cross by 2, 3, 4 or 8 – or indeed any other number? \\nPERSON28 :    Mr Friedrich, there is no minimum number of boxes to tick. \\nPERSON29 :    – Mr President, it is regrettable that we do not have an opportunity to hear from the vice-presidential candidates, even though we have the right number. It would have been good to know who the candidates are. We have to remember that 50% of the Members here are new and do not know the people they are voting for.It would have been in the interests of transparent democracy for us to have heard who the people were, so we could choose and put them in order. The vice-presidential role is not just a ceremonial role in presiding over these debates but a key decision-making role in the Bureau. Some of the candidates are very new. I suggest that in future candidates make one-minute presentations.I also suggest that we hear from the Quaestors when they are elected tomorrow, because they are the people who are meant to be representing MEPs. Otherwise, we have no say whatsoever as to the people we are electing.Finally, we should depoliticise the Quaestors, so we have real representatives for MEPs. \\nPERSON30 :    Mrs Gill, I am grateful for your suggestion, but nobody has requested the floor in relation to it. I shall communicate your views to the political groups so that they may consider the matter. But now, we have already begun the vote and it is too late to deal with your request.We shall proceed to the vote(2).(3) \""
