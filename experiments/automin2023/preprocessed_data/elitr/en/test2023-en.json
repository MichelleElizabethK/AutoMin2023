            "I can hear you.",

            "And you can hear –. You cannot hear me or –.",
            "Yeah. So. I'll try to reconnect. I'll –. Yeah –. So, PERSON8. Hello, can you say something?",
            "Oh yeah. Hi.",
            "Oh, yeah. I. I have to reconnect. Making PERSON8 the host, for now. Yeah. So, I'll make PERSON8 the host for now, and I reconnect. Leave meeting.",
            "Oh, okay. I hear you, by the way. Hello.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Now I can hear it. So, for some reason I have always to connect a few times until zoom starts sending also the sound to me. So, It's annoying. Yeah. So. I was in a call until the very last minute. So, sorry that I didn't remind everybody to – to connect. And –. I'm happy to see that you are here. So, let's start. And also my machine crashed in the meantime, so I had to, like, restart it. And now it's all, like, starting up. So, so, I would like to start, maybe in the other order. In the opposite order than last week. So, PERSON7, if you could start. You were one of those –.",
            "So, you want to hear, what did I do?",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So. The transcripts for check are almost done. And one – one transcriber of Germany's working. And she wants to do it alone, until December the 10th. And my mother is writing the question for the German subti – subtitle user study. And she – and she has some progress, and then – then she will move it to the spreadsheet, so we can get, her feedback and – and continue with that. And I started to write deliverables.",
            "Okay, that's great. Starting to write de –. That's –. That's excellent. I'm hopeful about PERSON12, but I haven't heard from him back. And he is not on the call either. So let's –. Feel free to ping PERSON12 –. Yourself as well. So the more –.",
            "Okay.",
            "The more – the more, we do, the better. Great. Yeah, then.",
            "Can I ask PERSON11 to do, the transcripts of –. By German ASR for the German transcriber.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that –.",
            "So –. So, I have just added the transcripts for the first 30 parts, and for the next ten parts, it's still running.",
            "Okay.",
            "But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly –. Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong. So, some files are still –. Have still weird output. But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah, that's great. So, I support this, it's, it's, it's great that, Dá. PERSON7, you have thought of PERSON11. And PERSON11 now has the time. There are other things where I was, thinking of PERSON11 and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening. So if you, PERSON11, had the time. Obviously, there is no way we could do it for the next week. But we should really have the system – ready for –.",
            "I looked at the tutorial from, from, from the NLP was it?",
            "For the upcoming sessions and I've asked demand because I've seen the meme project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's sli – slightly easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But, their mission translation is doing shortening simply because the data is shortening. And that's because their target size, is – are the subtitles which are created for the hearing-impaired. So, there is like natural shortening in the data. It'd be great if we could also locate some, such type of the data where there is some natural shortening happening. We would – wou –. We would put it in the architecture.",
            "That's also possible. But also, I looked at the, at the –. Tutorial from the, from the –.",
            "Yeah, it was.",
            "Yes,. Actually, so –. So, all of our models, basically work with, with, yeah, sequence to sequence where we just process the entire –. Input sentence. And, then, when we have the final, output from, from, from the entire input sentence, we, start, generating, but, the output sentence. But, but, actually, so –. The people from –. I think, it was actually. They are doing it, so that they are just processing prefixes. So they pre –. Process first key words as they, as they, give them into the input. And hen they generate the first word. And, and then, basically with every new token that they get. They generate, the new –. One new token. So, basically, it is much faster because you just generate one word at a time. And also, I think it –. It could be quite easy to implement the, shortening in this, in this model as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because we can just stop generating after some time.",
            "Yeah. So, it would be shortening because we ran out of time, right?",
            "Yes. So basically we would just, call it like to –. We would just train it, so that it s –. Stops generating it after the –. Some, some time. Yeah. So, so that could also work.",
            "Yeah. So they have talked to PERSON9. Or PERSON9 mentioned it in a call that is, PERSON3 is not ready, has no, specific things, for speech translation. So this and other strategies are no longer PERSON3.",
            "Okay, okay, so we would have to implement this.",
            "Yeah. And there is nobody –. In Edinburgh, who would have the time to do that. So if you would have the time, then you are one possible candidate. And we actually don't have any other candidates. Where maybe I thought that, that maybe some students of PERSON1, I do not know if he is on the call already. But that is also like very risky and like distant. So it would be difficult, but, so that –. The only other possible candidate would be, PERSON13, from the PROJECT1. Who, like, works halfway in Prague and halfway in Brno. But he is working on other things in PERSON3. So, I don't want to, like, to focus him too, too, much. So –. PERSON11, Please, think about it. If –.",
            "Okay, okay, bso right now I don't know if it is realistic, because I, I was just looking at the PERSON3 some time ago. And, I saw, basically, like, yeah. It's quite like, quite low level. It's written in. So, I don't know how, how hard it will be to change this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But if I, I see that it is possible, if I understand what's going on in the code, then, yeah, I –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Will like, let you know, based on, yeah, what they thi –.",
            "Yeah. Thanks. So let me check the –. This is so –. So poor. I would never use –. So, we have PERSON2, PERSON4 and PERSON8 you here on the call further. So now, from all of you, I would like to hear an update for the sessions, for next week. So, one thing is the Monday seminar. That should be done very easily, don't bother yourself with that much. But I think that PERSON4 should just like, click, click on s – some buttons and get the get the, vocabulary, expanded for that, right?",
            "Well, yes –. Will work on it tomorrow.",
            "Yes, but then a lot of effort is to be put into – the preparation for the two setups. For, PROJECT2 and. And, PERSON4 you mentioned that you don't have the webpage for PROJECT2. Is that still true?",
            "No. I fi – found it. And I, I just saw the programme for PROJECT2, and I was checking the talks. And I am trying to, gather the data. The relevant from those parts that are mentioned in the programme.",
            "So, could you mer. Maybe, per – perhaps –. Well, oh, you are you away? So, you are away the whole Friday? Or only at eleven?",
            "I'm away from eleven to one. No, ten to twelve.",
            "Ten to twelve. Okay, so in the afternoon, for example, in the Czech afternoon. You are able to, to do something. So, I would suggest if it's not too late for, for issue. And I guess it's not. That, you could have a Zoom call again with the videos and –. And to, to have a dry run of some past similar talks to PROJECT2 talks. And see how that system works. And, at the same time, we can do the same thing with the for example. The, the, Supreme Audit talks. So they are in the elite, the death set. So I will. We have the links, some or else, maybe –.",
            "I'm, I'm a bit afraid that the probably will not be prepared till tomorrow. Because tomorrow I will be working on the Monday seminar model as well. So I think we can run the dataset for Monday.",
            "Yeah, well –.",
            "Is it too late?",
            "The more tests we do, the better. So, even if we do the test of, like, the two concurrent subtitlings without domain adaptation, it would be useful test.",
            "Okay. For sure.",
            "So, so, PERSON8, if you could plan for tomorrow afternoon, so that –.",
            "Yeah, I'm planning to do that.",
            "So there –. It will be two videos, played concurrently. So that actually means that we need you to operate two machines. That's another critical thing.",
            "I can't op –. I can operate two machines. I have two laptops at home. So, I can do that, I guess.",
            "Yes, but you need two local machines. You need to unit ark, and one more machine with X to go.",
            "I can use black bird.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So Ark and blackbird, right? Yeah. So tomorrow in the afternoon, should we say, like one or two, Czech time. What is better for you?",
            "Both is okay with me.",
            "Both are good for me.",
            "So I suggest that at one. Czech time. So, like, Zoom Test for –. Two –. YouTube videos at the same time. So, PERSON8, would the, two, presentations be ready to paragraph use ready?",
            "So I got the access to, my engage, last night, so it was pretty late in India. So I didn't set up my account. Then, I will complete it today. Basically yesterday, I, worked with all the steps. So, it should be easy for me to do that now. Oh, it will be done today, I guess. Yeah. So tomorrow we are going –.",
            "There is, there is some chance that –. Yeah. So, and PERSON6 will provide –. PERSON8, PERSON8, setting up, two presentations. So, and PERSON4, PERSON4 has been working on adaptation, for the two domains. PERSON8 setting up to online text –. To paragraph setting. On quest plus virtual machines, behind. And then, Friday, test time for two concurrent sessions. So it will be arc plus blackbird. One will follow saw video, one will follow. I will say CL video. So PERSON4, if you put, could put a link here. Please add a link –. PERSON4 –. And, I will put a link, PERSON6 will put a link here. Yeah, so this will be the two videos. We will start them, and we will watch that. The pipeline will be probably the very same. But still, you should like, have it as two separate pipelines. And you must not mess it up. And later. Like later Friday, or on, in, on Monday. The models will be updated with the, with the domain elected ones.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, on Friday, use –. Two separate pipelines, but each running actually the same thing. Update the – each of the pipelines –. Each of the pipelines on Monday for the two different domain adaptations. Yeah, so that is, that. And I'm curious about the evaluation, the scores, so PERSON8, you have mentioned that you are already doing some ASR.",
            "Yeah, so, I am compiling some days, are tasked for that. But I am, facing some issues. It's basically that some videos are not, are not, some videos are not properly into a 16 cave format. So I'm looking into that. So PERSON10 told me yesterday that there are some issues with some audio, and I have to do that manually if that does not happen.",
            "Yeah. So, this is essential –. This should be –. We should, we all should know like how to do it. It should be part of the automatic evaluation of a leader test set, right?",
            "It is, yeah, it is.",
            "That is, that is not working properly.",
            "Yeah. But there are some audio files, where it, it gets converted to, the MP3 format. But when you pass it to the sound system, or the sound system will not work on that.",
            "So this is this is strange. Issues with some files –. With the –. The 16 c – format, converted from so –. Yeah, PERSON8, seek for any help you can get. If PERSON10 can do that, then, please tell PERSON10 to do it.",
            "Yeah, he is here with me, to do it. So I am doing it today, but –.",
            "Yeah –.",
            "That, that takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is are getting passes where they. So once I know that I can keep a track of it, so, for future –. Or actually, for future I would not. Would not need it, because once I have the web be file, I probably won't, won't need to do convert.",
            "Well, this, this should be actually –. Can you still hear me? The sound quality is a little worse. So this should really be done, all the time. So every time we run this evaluation, it should be, run from scratch. So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a and fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.",
            "Yeah. But still, if I am keeping track of the files, which, are – need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of at least the known ones. And of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.",
            "Yeah. So this is an important thing that we should have, like come across, or it is, a months ago. Remember, it is, is – since August that I've been telling you that, that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And, like every time, you, you all. It is not just you, you personally, PERSON8. There were other things, obviously. But like, every time, you thought about that, you thought that, well, this will be easy. We will just run it. And only when you actually do it, you will see all the problems. So this is known, common. It is always like that. So that's a message for everybody. Before you try, you never know what would be the problem. So for example, the call that I had, that, there was, someone was interviewing me so they, they, they wanted to record the video. Zoom never worked as badly for me as it, as it was today for the recording. So before you do, you cannot say whether it will work or, or not. And here we are running on the, in the problems of conversion, of the, of the file formats. So hopefully, we will be able to, like, quickly get the numbers. So do you have any word error rates so far?",
            "No, I have not processed it. So PERSON1 said that, once, they get the transcript, we will done it together. Because he also has not thoroughly the system. So he wanted to do it together.",
            "Yeah, ye –. And you have the –.",
            "And I'll have a call with –.",
            "Today.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, that is very important. So PERSON1 is going to be extremely busy, because he is organising some event, tomorrow and over the weekend. So we, we must not rely on PERSON1, so today is your last chance to get it running before the, the weekend. And then only from Monday onwards, probably he, he could help. So that is that thing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Than maybe, have also PERSON10 on that call with PERSON1? Is that planned that way?",
            "Not right now. I will ask PERSON10 if he is available.",
            "Please do. And, who else could be of any help there? So, my only thinking, is of PERSON11 who was able to simply come by and help immediately.",
            "Well, in this –. I do not think anything will be, any –. I don't know. For now, there are like a lot of things to run, but I'm also simplifying everything, so that, we won't have –. I think –.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, so let's hope it will all work out. So, as soon as you have any numbers, please send them to me. Just, regardless how low or high the numbers are, this –. Just receiving the numbers will be a big relief for me.",
            "I will, at least for –. I, at least for, I will send you the numbers today. Yeah, so for which data set, the –.",
            "It is a khanic admitted, that, it is the 2020, it's part of that.",
            "Khan, Khan Academy? Ok, it is just –. I mispronounced it. So probably, you know the correct pronunciation, and I do not recognise it. Yeah. So there is these saw files. And these are more important, because they reflect the domain that we have for the SG1 meeting. And there is the money dogs, and these are important for the, SL domain.",
            "Yes, oh, okay, so, I, I, I will all the three.",
            "Yeah, okay, great. Yeah. And, so, I know that PERSON4 is working on the adaptation for the two domains. We'll do a Monday seminar, tomorrow, that we will like, one shot think. And, I'm very curious. So, PERSON4, are you taking a part in that call, with PERSON1 as well?",
            "No.",
            "I think it is a, I think you – you also should, because, you should also evaluate, the –. So, I'm hoping that you will be able to have the multiple custom dictionaries in the, our system. The dictionaries that come from PERSON2, and that you will choose, which is the best, one. That you will have some numbers to, to choose – which of the ASR systems should be used. Which of the vocabulary should be used. And for that you need the evaluation. So, whatever you see by, shown by PERSON1, will be also useful for you. Unless you already know how to run SLTF.",
            "No, I don't know yet. And, so, I think there are some things to discuss about the, the multiple dictionaries. I received your email yesterday with, the thing I was –. I mentioned in the mail, that the ASR system without using people's pronunciation was better than the one used with people's generated pronunciations.",
            "So, so, sorry, say it again, and be more precise. So PERSON2 sent this email with the four words, the Watson, IBM –.",
            "Yes. So this was. So, I sent the, files to PERSON2, three kinds of IBM and three kinds of Watson.",
            "Yeah. So he sent me, the phonemes spoken in those files.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And so, since his model works on some ESL. And so he first recognised the words in the audio file, and then converted into phonemes and then sent it to me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So there was –. For example, there was one file in which the word was for IBM. And so –. The ESL decoded it, as I think, four IBM, and so the phonemes were. So in this way, he sent me the phonemes, and I added those pronunciations in my dictionary. And so the performance of de – description was exactly the same with the – without adding these pronunciations in their dictionaries. And the one, domain adaptation model, that I developed with my manual, pronunciations. The perform is slightly better than, these models.",
            "Okay, yeah. Yeah, well, this is too small of a sample. And then I know that – PERSON2 produced, the long, word list, right? And you have not tested that one yet.",
            "Yes, there is, there is a phoneme to grapheme list.",
            "Yes.",
            "I do not –. So, or I'm confused. How can I use it as it is? I think, that can be used by developing for some model, from forming the graphic model and then using it.",
            "No, no, no. This is –. This is exactly what you did with the Watson. So, you just swap the columns.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So you just convert the, the international phonetic alphabet into the phonemes, that, that CMU knows.",
            "So it means that, that the list should contain Watson.",
            "Well, I don't know if the list contains Watson, but it's –.",
            "But I mean, it assumed that the list should contain our words –.",
            "Yes. Yeah, yeah. And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So, the thing that I asked for, is that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM. This will be not so frequent. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this alzo, if you remember, if he says this alzo with Z 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the Z. And if he sometimes manages to say correctly also, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like, PERSON4 to be in touch with PERSON2. Maybe you continue on call, right? I have to –. I, I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids, the, the, the lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So PERSON4, please show to PERSON2 what is the dictionary that the system is accepting. Share your screen, and, and show it. And PERSON2, please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will be still needed, is the, language model substitute. But all these words, should be like the known words. So PERSON4, you need to figure out what words are in the – in the language model. And the words which are in the language model, should be simply copied. So the, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognised. The phonemes, as PERSON2 proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column, that will be also the same again for all of those, and there will be, again, the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees. And I think that this way, the – these systems should be able to load it. And you will also possibly run into one more problem, that is not ready for two big custom dictionaries. So this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the you two together. So PERSON2 knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like, when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two knowledges –. Pieces of knowledge together. So that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So PERSON2, does this make sense?",
            "Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.",
            "Yeah, so is there anything else, PERSON2, that you – that you have?",
            "Well, maybe, maybe interesting information for Dominik. I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for, for time stamping. I'm not sure, how, good it will be because I'm trying to do it on Libry Speech. And although, when I was downloading, it, they claimed it has more than 600 hours. But then the training said that the actual training set contains only around 300 hours. And I'm still not sure whether this 300 hours does not contain, similar sentences. Or actually the same sentences, but spoken by, by, by different speakers. Yeah, so it's, it is, because, well –. For example, in English or Czech I was used to, used to observe more steep conversions. And now it – now it, won't convert so fast. So, if, if I'm a –. I, take, some samples of – during the training. Then there are some, still some, serious errors in the ASR output. So, so, maybe, I'm, I'm hopeful that for, for the time stamping, it is good enough. Or at least we, we might try it.",
            "Okay, sure. And is it possible to enrich the language model by texts, because we have lots of relevant texts from your parliament.",
            "Oh well, for, for the decoding. I, my views also language model. Well, it depends on what we want to do. If we want to just infer like, like open transcripts, then we can, we can use the language model. And we can, we can also get, get the time stamps for, for, for the transcript. If, if you have transcript, and we want just, want to do just a time stamping then there is no way how we can use the language model.",
            "Yes, I –. We may need both. Transcripts for set. Or, I mean, forced alignment for the fantast set. And then reco –. Recognition for, for the rest. For around a 100 hours.",
            "Well, there are for the recognition, there is possibility to use language model.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, thanks for the progress. Please discuss this separately. I just – because I really have to leave. I would like PERSON4 to stay on the call with PERSON2, right? And discuss how to use the dictionary. And I see PERSON10 here. So PERSON10, how much time do you have in the coming days?",
            "It actually depends on what day are we asking, like, I have some presentations to make an assignments are piling up.",
            "Yeah. So, well there is a lot of things that PERSON8 needs to do. And I think it would be good if you two would like split it among yourselves so that PERSON8 can manage that in time. So there is this, the scoring, some meeting with PERSON1 this afternoon. So I think you should really join that as well.",
            "Okay – PERSON4.",
            "Because this is the numbers that we want to obtain for the different models. And then PERSON8 needs to prepare to have the double system running. We will do first test of this tomorrow at 1 Prague time. So I think that if you, PERSON10, focused more on getting the numbers, and PERSON8 focus more on getting these systems running, then it would –. Then we will reach the goals.",
            "Okay, makes sense, all right.",
            "So please discuss this separately to find the time, I don't know the meeting time for, with PERSON1. And, yeah –. But I really want to see the numbers. So I would like to have the ASR numbers, today. And improved numbers on Monday, when PERSON4 has the domain adaptation for those. And then we will, on Monday, decide which of the models to use. And we can still move Monday to Tuesday, but Tuesday is already the PROJECT2 day. So the, the CL decision really has to happen on Monday. And we need at least two numbers to compare. So, get one number the baselines now and the – the improved on Monday.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm leaving at the moment. And if it, asks me to know. Now, PERSON8 is the host, so that is that is good. As long as the PERSON8 is on the call –. Like you, the call can run. So please, PERSON4 and PERSON2, synchronise and PERSON10 follow that as well. And PERSON8, and you synchronise –. And get the numbers and send any numbers to me today. So as, as a baseline. So thanks and sorry for taking more time. And fingers crossed for – for all the, for these tests. Thanks. All right.",
            "PERSON10, I'll send you a text on Slack later or –.",
            "Yes.",
            "So later today. Because, I was mentioned by you on the call, call yesterday, or the day before yesterday. I tried processing it but I think some of the files, even in khanic terminators are, are those files, which doesn't get converted into 16 format pretty easily.",
            "Okay, that is not, not a big issue. But I'll take care of it again. So, are we discussing anything else? I would stay in the call but I see silence, so –.",
            "By the way, what do you want compare, PERSON8? All the workers and their quality and latency?",
            "Actually mostly about the –. It is basically about the error rates in multitranslation and the ASR?",
            "Yes, I think we have only one option for ASR, don't we? Only one ASR, or there are two?",
            "Sorry?",
            "How many ASR workers do we have?",
            "Right now. One is from K80. One is what we use for our Monday Seminars. That's two. Even with K80, we have two. One is the nearest one –.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sequence to sequence, the other one is a normal one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And in the Monday Seminar one, PERSON4 is going, do the adaptation. For –. For – both the different tasks. And, finally, on Monday, we'll see, or which model performs best.",
            "Yes. When I did the comparison of the workers for SLT. Then I observed that, that there are no big differences in machine translation parts. But the, the bottleneck in quality, was the ASR quality. So you may select the best ASR worker in quality. And then, then, then pick the MT worker with the lowest latency and, and some good flicker. And latency and flicker may test quite, quite easily, on one document. And not, not, on the whole test set.",
            "Yes.",
            "I also –. During the month of August, we also had numbers for the MT models. Where –. What do I say, the rainbow MT models. Scores were better than our, our –. I think, yeah, maybe or PERSON11 –.",
            "It was PERSON3.",
            "You just, PERSON3?",
            "Think so.",
            "I'm not sure. No, I, you –. I think you were not there, at that moment so –. You may not know about it.",
            "I have the school so –.",
            "Okay, you have this course, so –. So –. Actually, PERSON5 compared this course between –. I think, it was rainbow and, summer set of workers. And rainbows set – a set of rainbow workers were better. I think it was PERSON11's, two, 43 to 43 languages. And that were kind of –. They had like little lesser scores, I mean –. Rainbow workers had better scores, in, in short, yeah.",
            "Okay, basically. What on the remission on the call is divorced to use individual translation workers. You can see if they are performing better. So if not, then obviously we can fall back to, to the rainbow.",
            "Okay, so I'll make PERSON4 the host now, because I will go and have my lunch. It is pretty late here, and I did had my lunch.",
            "Thank you, bye, bye. And text me on Slack in the weekend.",
            "Yeah, bye.",
            "Okay, PERSON7. Okay, I am –.",
            "Bye.",
            "I am just – trying to commit it. But – so okay. I have it in the good format now, but I just – because I'm just checking the folders. And for some folders, the output is like totally terrible. I don't know why is this.",
            "Okay.",
            "But for some folders, it is okay, for some it's terrible. Like all the words are some, just –.",
            "It may be caused by the speaker. Maybe he doesn't speak clearly for the ASR.",
            "Because, like, it is just like the, most common words in the language, I would say, which are, which are recognised over and over. Like half of the world is like aber.",
            "Yeah. It may happen. Maybe you can, if you want to inspect it, then listen to the to the, to the source audio, and you will see. This is yeah, and it.",
            "Yeah, I'm trying to do this, yes.",
            "And it doesn't matter if, if we miss some, some, me of them. And the annotator will –. Can and filter them out, by herself. We can keep them there –.",
            "Because like for the first files it worked. And now I have files with Czech names. And fo – for this, it is working quite bad. So, yeah, it could be this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm just going to check it once more, and then I will push it.",
            "Great. And it will be good to commit or to save the, to –.",
            "I'd say it's probably not the speaker, but it's the files, because often for the files. Like when I converted them even to the right format. It just told me like FFMPEG again told me that, that there were wrong time stamps in the file, whatever that means. And basically, the – so – the yes –. So, so I, I now see that the transcripts for, for these files are – don't have the right length. So they were processed incorrectly. And I'm not sure how, how to convert them properly, because FFMPEG just returns an error for those files, so –. Yeah, but it does not support the format, actually.",
            "You may try sox.",
            "Yeah, but it doesn't support the format, actually.",
            "Which for – format, is it? OGG?",
            "It is –. Yes, it's actually O –. Wait. Then it should –. I don't know why I didn't. I will try it once more. Okay, yeah, I will, I will. Then I really use soxi, okay. I don't know what was actually the problem. Okay, yeah. Because, because for most of the folders that I transcribed later, there's this problem, that basically –. The length is incorrect. Oh, okay, so I will change this to soxi? And actually, how many, how many work – workers can I run in parallel on CPU? Is it like – can I run, let's say 100?",
            "On, on one machine, or?",
            "I don't know, like on anywhere.",
            "Or in Q to F, you can run 100.",
            "Okay, because right now –.",
            "Or –.",
            "Yeah. Because I think that right now the best way is to throw away everything and to run everything in parallel, so that like in one hour everything would be done.",
            "Yes. No, no, no, no problem.",
            "Because, because like now, I think for – maybe half of the files it would be, you know, like totally wrong. And that would like confuse everyone, and I can't really find which files it is, be –.",
            "Yes.",
            "Because it's a lot of files. So I would have to open everything now, or.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So maybe I'll just change the converting –. Okay.",
            "And the converting command is called sox. S, O, X. S, O, X, I is another commanded. It gives you only information. And you may google of the format of the conversion – for the conversion.",
            "Sorry. I accidentally refreshed –. Okay, I will try it for one file if it works better. For this guy called strejček.",
            "PERSON2, are you still here?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And how much time do you have to work on the German ASR? Can we –. Can we, or should we go forward with the language models to process the interpreters?",
            "Like you would like to train a language model.",
            "Yes or –.",
            "Well –. I am – continuously saving checkpoints so I can already run the ASR. So if you provide me a la – language model, then I –.",
            "I can only provide you the texts. The monolingual German text. The –. In the European domain. And so it will be in domain. And then I hope there will be good quality for the recognition.",
            "Well, one more thing. My ASR is – lowercase. Is it okay for you?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. And without punctuation also.",
            "Yes, we don't –.",
            "Okay.",
            "We don't care, so far.",
            "Right. Then you can provide me with it. I'm not sure whether I, I, get it done by today, but –.",
            "No problem.",
            "Tomorrow, I think it could be done.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, yeah, one more thing. So I figured out that actually, in the – in some of the files, there is –. You don't just hear the interpreter, but you also hear the person saying something in English in the background. So maybe that could also be the problem. The speaking of the wrong person, actually.",
            "Yeah, only – only at the beginning or during the whole –.",
            "Everywhere. That is the thing, everywhere.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, so, if it does work now, then okay. If it doesn't work, then I can apply some kind of filter to cut off the –. This effort with low volume, maybe.",
            "It's, it's okay or –.",
            "Okay, I will just try how it works.",
            "Or we can ask the, the annotator, whether the transcription work helped, to spare the – her time. And, if she says that not, even when the quality is good, then, then we don't need to care much about the rest.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we are the focus on PERSON2's high quality on, on the others.",
            "PERSON2, we may discuss now?",
            "Fine.",
            "Now, we discuss, no? Or some thi –, PERSON7?",
            "No, I, I think we are done. I will send an email to PERSON2.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "And I may disconnect this call. So see you.",
            "Bye.",
            "So, if I am sharing my screen, just a minute. I think can you see my screen?",
            "Yes.",
            "So, actually, this is the format of dictionary that is used by the ASR. And, the, so first one is the word. And the next is the pronunciation of the word and –.",
            "And –. This, this curly brackets, wha –.",
            "I actually do not know why is this here. But there are the curly brackets around the pronunciation and be curly brackets around first and the last phoneme WB in there.",
            "And, and that some special mark, or, or –.",
            "Which one?",
            "The WB.",
            "Yes, this is, this is, I don't know. Probably the, the requirement of the two kit. So it is WB for all the words.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "It is the right before starting and ending phoneme. And even if – this is not there, I think it is not a big issue for me to append. But the problem is, so this is the, CMU dictionary. And it is actually, is in at public format. So I think you can find that, over, on Wikipedia, as well. By this alphabet.",
            "Yeah. So it appeared to two, two letter. Is also available on there. And I – there is a – I under –. They found a package of our language, which, which automatically converts the IP to alphabet the other way around. So that can be converted easily but the problem is, that, there a – phonemes, there are some IP formats that are not in alphabet. Just let –. This –. I couldn't –.",
            "Okay.",
            "That wasn't converted by s –. This is the email window. And so, there was - were some phonemes that were not converted into the alphabet phonemes. And, so, I am afraid that when I will be processing this list of graph –. List of graphemes to phonemes, so probably there will be some issues regarding the, such phonemes. So if –. I can share the other package with you, if, if you are familiar with that. It is very easy to use. Various manual is also available for that package, so –. You can use that package as well. Or in any way, if you would convert these – this IPA a into alphabet phonemes that would be great for me. Is it possible?",
            "I can, take a look, at the –. Well, I have a –. Send you some link once. But I'm not sure where it was. Was it done –. It was on Skype, I guess. I found some dictionary.",
            "Is it –. But I think –.",
            "CMU to IPI and –. Well, this strange A, you mentioned. Can you copy the, the, the letter to chat please?",
            "And just let me –.",
            "There it is.",
            "There was another, as well, but I –. I don't remember with one it was exactly.",
            "Se – send another one.",
            "It seems that, there is no –. Well, maybe we could replace this phoneme with some other one. Because actually, we want t, we want to – produce some a – variable pronunciation. So actually, actually. It's okay if we substitute, substitute it. I don't know how to copy this, but, if –. There is some nice chart in, in Wikipedia, that shows you the nearest, nearest phonemes to this one. And the nearest one are, for example. you did – the link. These two or this one. These three, so we can, just, so we can just, copy. We can just substitute each word with this phoneme. With two other words, with both, or, or three other versions of that word with using these three, this three phonemes?",
            "Can you share the link of Wikipedia please? Because I think there may be some further phonemes problems. So you with that I would be okay.",
            "If you go to the vowels paragraph, then there is some mapping or some map of how, which phonemes are actually near, and which are more, far apart.",
            "Are you talking about this chart?",
            "Can you open it in your window, because I'm still seeing your common line. Yeah, yeah, this one. Yeah.",
            "I don't know the pronunciation of any of this.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I don't know the pronunciation of any of these vowels. So are they actually near when they are spoken, or?",
            "I, I guess that they are so –. If – no – just open them. There should be some –. There should be some examples. For example, for the open-mid, the central open-mid, the first, first IPA phoneme. If if you click on it, then, for example, it's not bird like bird. Like the flying, flying animal, a bird. And there's this example. And if we go for, for, for the letter, we do not have in CMU. And there is an example like a nut, nut, bird, nut. Or –.",
            "That's right, I will see it then –.",
            "Or maybe –. And it's in which word in our dictionary? It is in –. Where it is? I am blind. Where did you find this? This rotated A.",
            "I think –. It is IPM, it is. I think the better example is this third E in Watson.",
            "I do not see it there.",
            "It's, it's –.",
            "It's the E.",
            "Yes, it is a Watson, son and som here. Well, I guess that's quite near. And en, what son. Maybe, I'm well somehow, if you pronounce it and pronounce it incorrectly. Well, Sorry, sure I need to go, because I have another meeting. And I. I need to prepare myself. So please, please. Let us have a call tomorrow, have, have –. Are you free, free tomorrow? I'm. For example, let's say, Where is my calendar?",
            "I think probably it will be difficult to have a call tomorrow. I will let you know an email or Slack, because tomorrow I am off for Friday prayer on Friday for 10 to 12. And then we have a test run with PERSON8 that we were discussing.",
            "Okay, yeah, sure.",
            "I think it will be difficult tomorrow.",
            "Let's just –. Please just a write me what do you need from me, if you need from me to, to remap my dictionary to CMU, well, I can definitely do that. So is it what you need?",
            "Yes, if, if that can be done, it would be very great. Because I can do that, but I'm too many adaptation models. And so if you have time and you are not too busy. So, if you have time and you are not too busy, it would be great if you can do it.",
            "Well, okay, I can do that.",
            "If you could just convert this list into the CMU phonemes. So that, that would be IPA rather than IP. There will be the phonemes of alphabet.",
            "Sorry, once again, please?",
            "I'm saying that if you could just change these IPS to the alphabet phonemes, that would be great.",
            "To the, you mean?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, sure. Sure thing, okay. I will, will be in touch with you, probably tomorrow. Bye.",

            "And I don't think it should be like much work but I have no experience with Flask whatsoever.",
            "So what do you mean only annotation exactly?",
            "Like like for me, what I need is HTTP server, which can receive a stream of audio. And will send back stream of text and can do this for multiple users at time. So I think that the best is Flask maybe?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And and if you implement this, I can p fill in the ASR and so I definitely not think it's much work, I think that if anyone knows Flask, then this should be maybe done in an hour or so.",
            "D The real problem would be serving multiple people on the same ASR, I mean. Scaling, w pretty much.",
            "I mean like that's something I can handle, I think. I would do batching.",
            "Huh.",
            "Like I'm not sure how the Flask is serves more people at a time. If it's like every user in a different front or how this is exactly implemented.",
            "But but I think that it's not really important, because my model would be in a separate process. And the these two processes, like the fr Flask process with whatever number of fronts we'll use and my model will use queue. To synchronize, so and the model will take many requests at time, put it to one batch, do the inference and whenever I'm finished with infering, then there will be a second data structure. Like a queue per user. Where I put the intermediate results. And the server can then directly send it back to the client. So so what I need is really like the Flask or whatever it will be, should create a queue. Like a Python queue you know which queue.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm talking about. And and fill this queue for example like every 200 milliseconds with new audio frame.",
            "Which gets a stream of bytes, you don't have to work with whatever. Just just think of the speech as stream of bytes.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "And. And we'll put I don't know like every interval, like let's say 200 milliseconds this piece of audio to the to the queue and that's it. And.",
            "Do you think 200 milliseconds as an audio stream is. I don't know how your ASR would handle that. Is it okay it's not any legible thing, so. 200 milliseconds is like too small.",
            "Yeah yeah I have like four 250 milliseconds and I'm using for speech translation and well, it's definitely doesn't have that good results, but it's for speech translation, which is not difficult task. So I think that actually for speech transla speech recognition, this might be okay. But I will handle the further logic later.",
            "So I told you to 200 milliseconds just to like make room for me and to do the other optimization later in for the model.",
            "Because that's code which I can handle myself.",
            "But but the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do. Because I have no experience and no time f to get it running to.",
            "I thought? meant something using I don't know, mediator from?.",
            "No, no really like, just like make HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue. And and send the text back in a HTTP request. Because my idea is that like user clicks be well it should be used in the Ukrainian project too.",
            "And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button. And starts to speak and when the user is speaking, you are sending at the same time the audio in r small chunks. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And and to the to the HTTP server, the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with ASR. And the model will do some logic, like some inference with that. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send back and the user should get the get the partial transcript back. And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.",
            "I could think about that. Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.",
            "Oh maybe a different HTTP server. I don't know like maybe we don't even need like some fancy HTTP server for that.",
            "I mean for only text flow we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.",
            "Yeah the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.",
            "Well I think online text flow something around 2 000 at least. Something like that. Like it can connect like 2 000 people. But the thing is that's just one way. So basically, we are sending data to them. We are not receiving anything.",
            "Okay. So that's that's problem, because this has to be.",
            "Yeah, yeah both ways.",
            "Both ways. Yeah. And well a solution would be to have like two connection.",
            "If if it doesn't duplex is not possible, then one connection for streaming the audio to us and one connection to s to getting the audio back. For example, what I can imagine is that once you create the connection, then before you s like the client starts streaming the audio, the client gets client ID. And with the client ID, it can then query the transcript. And there will be a stream of transcript, if the client is querying it. So maybe that also can could work. But I think I think that actually HTTP should be duplex.",
            "Yeah, it is actually. Yeah, it is.",
            "So so then there shouldn't be a problem.",
            "Yeah. I'll I'll definitely look into that. Like just after. Yeah. If it makes sense.",
            "Okay. Okay. Perfect. Then then good luck for your exams.",
            "Thanks.",
            "And I really don't envy you.",
            "Well I mean it's I guess it's just two exams, more or less.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Which does a bit pretty tough. One is data structure and another is. Well, I didn't ICC last semester, so I'm giving ICC this semester.",
            "Yeah, ICC?",
            "Introduction to Computability and Complexity.",
            "Oh, but I heard that it's. They made it easier.",
            "No, it's as complex. It's it's not easy. Definitely not easy.",
            "Okay, well it was compulsatory also for me. Oh no, they did. Data structures are easier now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because before we had to code the data structures in C +. Like you could also do it in Java, but if you do it in Java, they will I think that they like gave you less points I think. Because.",
            "Like they were definitely they were already really disappointed and unhappy if you use different something different from pure C or C +.",
            "Yeah, I guess this semester. I mean we have a? C +, or Python. We have like two options.",
            "PERSON7, you had also, you had already Python allowed?",
            "Yeah, I think that we had we had.",
            "Okay, I think that we were the last year who had to do the dirty stuff.",
            "Doing it in C + is fun, but well in Python, it's just less work.",
            "Well, it really depends al and of course, we had just I think that three or four assignments and I heard that you might.",
            "I had like 12 or 10.",
            "Yeah, you have many and like you have to like finish some code, I think, right?",
            "Yeah, so. It's basically. Well, technically, we just have to limit the function.",
            "Oh, okay, because for us, it was like you have zero code and huge assignment. And we had like four maybe assignments. Or or maybe five. Huge assignments and the. I think that it would be fine if we should have used C +, but if they if they would provide some like already some code that would help a lot, but because we everyone had to have had to write his own code, then it was really problematic, because.",
            "Yeah, it's the same thing with us, but the thing is and like in our case, well technically, all we get is a? well files implemented. So basically, test files.",
            "Test files.",
            "So he has already implemented the tests. We get the test files and most of the time, the actual implementation is just I don't know. Some part of it is implemented, which is pretty easy. But the other part, which is actually the part about the doing things, that is still like completely empty and we were supposed to find it.",
            "Yeah, but the problem is that we didn't even have the interface and then.",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "If you if you fucked up the interface, then like writing the code was really like pointless. And this was many time the case. And even like I do not remember what it was, but I think there was no other way to do it then just use the templates in C +. And some like crazy templates.",
            "It wasn't just basic stuff. So. It was real pain. And actually, it was pain for me and I was quite good in C +.",
            "Oh!",
            "So so.",
            "I can imagine what has it been for others.",
            "Yeah, I think that the many people had failed just because of this.",
            "Yeah, I guess. I think in DL we also had a lot of assignments. But it was fun.",
            "In?",
            "In Deep Learning.",
            "Yeah. But Deep Learning, it's different thing I mean. I think that, well PERSON9 is like pretty crazy about the assignments.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You can you can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for PERSON9's courses and you will have like lot of work and no free times even though you have just one subject. But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not a really thing to fail his courses. Like to fail, because you are unable to finish it. Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass. I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.",
            "Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one? you'll get a one. Just within the second deadline, you should submit it. That's pretty much the only thing he asked. But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that. They find it's easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, study for the exam.",
            "Yeah yeah because well in general, he's his exams are rather easy.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I well I wouldn't say it's like absolutely super easy. Like like no like almost no question?, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun. Just fun.",
            "Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me. I had the? exam for? with PERSON5?.",
            "Oh, so that's something you I guess.",
            "Yeah? taking this course probably 16 or 17, I don't know.",
            "Oh, maybe that's new thing, because, well, they were both away.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "When I was. So. Yeah, maybe that's.",
            "But the good thing was that it's not graded, so.",
            "Okay.",
            "Just basically I'll write the exam. And there is no grades in that. So you just go there. But? it was actually quite a nice class for me.",
            "Yeah. Oh, that's good. Okay,. Well.",
            "Yeah, I don't think we have anything else to discuss. I guess.",
            "Yeah, I wanted to ask PERSON7, if he has something on us.",
            "Actually. Well actually, the what are you working on now, PERSON2? Because you mentioned that you were working on some automatic evaluation for compression? Or? Is it just or what? Because I don't.",
            "No, no, no, no. I'm definitely not working on evaluation for compression. But I just notice that even the even the COMET metric which I though that would be. Well, I cannot say if it's bad, but I think it's it's highly correlated with BLEU for at least for my purposes. Like my purpose is that I have one model and I'm trying different inference. Strategies to get it running online, so like logically, I expect that with lower latency, I get lower q translation quality. And I thought that maybe there will be larger difference between the measurements and I thought that maybe the BLEU is not necessary so good for this task, because the lower latency also changes the mean like changes the wording a lot. It produces definitely much more words, because when it prematurely commits to something and if it gets more context, then it turns out to be not that well translated, the prefix, which is already committed and it the model cannot change it, then it usually tries to somehow fix it. With and for the for fixing this, you need the model needs more generate more tokens. And whilst still, I think that the overall quality sometimes is not that bad. But. But. But I thought that maybe the like v the drop in BLEU was quite huge and I thought that maybe it's not only because the quality dropped a bit, because I thought that just it should drop a bit. But the drop was quite huge for BLEU and I thought that maybe if I take the COMET it will be like the differences should be smaller. And actually I think they were comparable. So. But but the problem is that the COMET also needed needs the reference. Which of course, it's not a problem for my use case, but still like if you have the reference, then the reference is of course translated is optimized for offline translation. Because it was done after the after the after the talk, so. So I think that this translation is this reference is not really good reference.",
            "And. Are you sure that there is no reference? For COMET? Because I think.",
            "Yeah yeah there is reference-free COMET ad I actually tried that and. And what was the result? Like extremely low scores. Even for offline model. So it didn't it well it did not do any difference to the BLEU and because everyone else is sticking to BLEU and there is no difference for comet, I'm sticking for to BLEU as of now.",
            "Well, because, yeah, so basically, you can cross like. So yeah. You have like the opposite. I'm trying to compress and like your output are actually like longer then, sometimes, right.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because because.",
            "Because the fixing part, yeah.",
            "Yeah, like it's it's really like when it has short context and because I do decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in for example second or two it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation. So it tries to use a different wording. To for example a specify the thing. So actually I really liked it. I like some of the translations are really like I was really amazed that even though like you could see that the model made mistake at the first try, but it really like wanted to do like some kind of correction. And it definitely elicit it sounded really fluent. Which I think that it's also important. You mainly if you really demand low latency, then I think that even like a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad qua translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the reas the translation is just pointless. But if the qua the lower quality is because just the translation is not like just does not like at the end, if you read everything that you will get the like same information, but I th maybe the wording is just poor, because it used for example more words and it like used some corrections and stuff. So like I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous as long as it does not like if you if you don't lose any information. I mean.",
            "And or which language pairs do you have some this results, like some examples? Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity, because.",
            "Oh definitely, I can I can dump you my logs.",
            "But, like in which languages? Because you know I don't speak German.",
            "English and German.",
            "Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German.",
            "Then I can provide English-Chinese and English-Japanese if it helps.",
            "Okay, so never mind.",
            "Okay. Well I don't have any other language. Which languages do you speak, if we are considering? Or well it doesn't make sense to do a different language, because like language of interest for me are all those from IWLST, because then I can claim that I beat the results, so.",
            "Yes, yes. Never mind. So like I speak Czech, Slovak, French I could understand something. Yeah, okay. Well, the reason I was asking it is that actually I found a data set on? phase. And it's for it's for com it's like there are compression data set and there are I think like five levels of compression. And there are they are humanly evalua like annotated. Like the quality in terms of grammar I think. And in terms of fluency. Or something like that. And so. Well, I'm conside. I was thinking about you know trying to derive some automatic metric based on this data set, because there is some like human evaluation. So, yeah, that's or if you would like to do something with that, I'm not sure whether it's useful for you. I'm like letting you know that there is some data set. Like it's.",
            "Okay, yeah, like first thing I somehow well as of now, as I'm thinking about it, I kind of lost interest to doing shorter translations, because actually I think that if you.",
            "Longer are better?",
            "Sorry?",
            "That longer are better?",
            "I mean like longer. Like I maybe it really depends on the user taste, but I think if we want lower latency, then we will probably. If we don't want to lose a lot of information, then we need to just generate more text. And so actually like for me, like doing high quality shortening means that then we will to have a low long or large latency.",
            "Yeah, I see.",
            "So so and I mean well maybe I actually don't think that it really has like a good use case. And actually I think that the. I talked about this with someone, maybe it was you or maybe it was Dominik. Like I maybe the whole shortening thing which what the interpreters do, is they do it because it's not a feature, it's a human limitation.",
            "I mean we humans or and particularly this interpreters we have like limited capacity and we cannot say as much as we wanted. As as we would like to. And and because like the interpreter has to like listen and at the same time, to speak. So he definitely needs to shorter shorten the sentences. And actually I think that this is something that the computers don't have. They can generate like whatever amount of data at one time. And they couldn't do it simultaneously to listening. So actually I think like assuring the lowest latencies is not really by shortening, but rather by lengthening. But not really trying to make the? longer, but rather it's like it's like it's also kind of limitation, because when you translate, you need context to translate with properly. And because you don't have the whole sentence, you don't know the context but if you like still want to have low latency, you cannot really wait till the sentence finishes, so you need to consider what's best right now. Translate it and hope for the best that you matched the translation and then, if you see that oh okay, well maybe I made a mistake. So you need to recover. And to do the recovery, you need to translate. You should just generate more text. So so it really depends on like what is our final goal. And and if it's like low latency translation, then actually I think it's fine to generate more. Because if you generate l because if you try to generate less, you will probably lose information. And the. Well. Okay, well maybe there is there is a use case I think for shortening. Or maybe not really shortening, but it's called isometric translation. And the goal of isometric translation is match is to match the length of the source. And I would be like I don't like to at least for online, I don't see any use case to for lengthening because no one really wants to lengthen. And and. Yeah like of course it makes sense if you want to for example do offline dubbing, then you first have a video, and then you want to provide the dubbing and you want to match s the person's like mimic and lip movement and so stuff then you want to perfectly match the length of the original speech, but I mean for a use case when you just want to gather the information from the source, then maybe the shortening actually makes sense, because some languages like I really I really watch this series with PERSON3.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And he's speaking Russian and I don't speak Russian and so I had to like ch watch the subtitles. And the problem with the with the Russ well, with I mean it's probably not Russian, but it's like a problem of Russian, but problem of the show is that the pace it's it's extremely d extreme. So so I was just reading the subtitles and I really didn't have time to enjoy the show, because all the time I was just reading, because there was lots of text. So so maybe for language pairs where the source is more compact and allows for large information pace, then maybe we need to need to shorten it a bit, so the user don't have to read so much.",
            "So the source the input language was like the source language was Russian, and what was the target language?",
            "Target language it was English I think or. Or Czech.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "I think, no, I think that it was English. But anyway, like it was not I mean it was not probably that Russian language is able to produce so many information a second, but it was just problem of the show. Right. Because it was a comedy and they were speaking like relatively fast. So so like they produced too many words per second. And then it's a problem to read it. So maybe then it makes sense to like maybe increase the delay a bit. And while enable me to like watch the watch the video, like watch the actual show. So. Maybe for that reason, would be would make sense to make at least shortage short some kind of shortening.",
            "Yeah, but actually, I like what you what you mentioned, like what you said about the isometric like languages. Because actually, I tried to.",
            "Give me a second, I need to take something for drink, because I'm dying.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON7, what are you working on now? I think you're done with IWSLT, right?",
            "Yeah. I'm done. And yeah, I'm in Paris actually now. So I'm here for an internship.",
            "I'm sorry, it's extremely hot in here.",
            "Yeah, same here.",
            "Yeah actually, today here is not so hot.",
            "And you have AC in the office?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Do you have AC?",
            "No.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "No, but I have the window open. Yeah, today it was raining in the morning, so.",
            "So it's not so. But there were some days during the week was so hot, like extremely hot. And inside the office, it was like really bad.",
            "Put it to the freezer.",
            "So it was I answer the question to PERSON1. So I'm working on. I'm trying to do like text compression or like not text compression, but like machine translation compression, so that you have input in one language and like make a model which shortens the translation. So like initial idea the initial goal was to do it for online or for like simultaneous translation, but like, well, we are now discussing with PERSON2 whether it's like useful or not. But I think that generally I think it's good to think about this, because ik like besides the use case you have mentioned PERSON2, about the isometric languages or but plus I think it's also like interesting to look at how much the length contributes to the to the sentence presentation. For example, that. Is it. How much can you actually compress the sentence? You know, the length of the sentence. While you preserve the information. And of course it's well probably it's not so useful for simultaneous machine translation and like as we were thinking about this at the beginning. But I think that it can be really interesting study.",
            "Yeah yeah, like I mean not even in theory. Well I mean in theory it's extremely interesting. Because like I almost know don't see any theoretical boundary for the compression ratio. Because I think I maybe like or maybe it's also like language dependent, because I know that for example Germans are really famous for having s words for lots of things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And you can like f something that you would need to use a kind of a description sentence. For for something, then maybe in some language, like for example in German, there is there is you have a special word for that. So. Like. For example, Germans have this which is like you are you are happy, because someone is doing bad. So. Like.",
            "So, so you see that I think that you can you can like compress things into like even one word. So. So.",
            "Yeah, that's interesting with German. Because on the other hand, they also have some things? like one word in English and in German, it's concatenation of four different words.",
            "Oh yeah. H.",
            "Something like hospital or ambulance.",
            "Yeah, yeah, it's just two words, it's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like is for illness and is for car. And.",
            "Yeah so.",
            "For example even this it's it's like two words, it's, which is like this like this someone is not doing well. And it's that happiness. Or or yeah, happiness. So so.",
            "That's still more or less words than what you would do in English. I'm not happy.",
            "Yeah but actually what I generally notice that Germans need much more words in general or maybe not words, but definitely letters to describe the same thing. Usually. On on average. Like if you I really tried to watch movies with German dubbing. And then, the I really have problems to follow, because I'm not that good in German. But the pace, if they wanted to match English, then the pace is extreme. So, so, so. Definitely like different languages have different pace. And then I think that the shortening makes sense.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or like. Like language what does this mean, the pace? Like when.",
            "When you like I mean we are talking about something in like let's say it's a constant pace that we have like some let's say that we're talking one information per unit time. And then two like reproduce the same information in different language. In this case in German. It just takes it just takes more time. So so to say like let's say you have some sentence in English,. I saw a car. Then then for example, a German would say, so much many words to same the same information. And because I think that well it also probably language-dependent, but I mean in general, you I guess people are telling the same amount of like same speed like our like the phonemes takes approximately the same in both languages, but you need to say more phonemes in order to say the same information. Or more words, more letters, whatever you take. And and so then it makes sense to do kind of a shortening. You could you could you could use a per example a different grammar in German to express the past. And then you will save one word. But it's more unusual to use this short tense in speech. In speech they prefer the past tense which is made up of two words. And and I think that there are many such things. That where you can save something. Or when you have more complex sentence, then you maybe can read remove some not that necessary information.",
            "Yeah. Yeah so.",
            "I think with movies it would be much more interesting, we have limited time? for a movie like two hours, so even the German dubbing should be two hours, but you have to say a lot more things.",
            "Well it's not just you know about just matching it in two hours, it's also that with dubbing, you want to match the even like when the original person is speaking so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So then you have to just speak really quickly and it's really what I notice with the German dubbing of English series or English movies.",
            "So like the pace is then really fast, they talk much more phonemes per second, than they tend to speak usual and then I'm really confused. Because I'm non native, so.",
            "So so this is it definitely has use case. But it's not as we thought as you said it correctly, as we thought. I don't think that it's useful for online speech translation. I think that for online speech translation, you probably want as low latency as possible. And if you if you need high quality, then you still don't want to do the compression, because then you need quality and you don't care if you read more, but you definitely don't want to lose any information and then you cannot definitely cannot do any shortening.",
            "Yeah I think the last time I heard someone who was shortening was PERSON6?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is that right.",
            "Yeah I know he did some experiment I think that the experiment is describing a CP paper.",
            "Yeah, I think so.",
            "And yeah. That's that's but I right now I'm I'm not interested in doing shortening, so I was before. But I'm not anymore. Well with the experience and the realization that actually the low latency model should output more than less, because it's actually like it's really it really should commit to something, like it should output something, because we want really low latency, but then if you if the guess was bad and the translation is bad, then the model or the ideal scenario, it should correct itself. Or maybe to specify the translation. So I most of the time, I when you have like I think that this actually happens a lot in the data. Because the TED talks are in English and I'm translating to German. Then in English, you have subject and the verb. As as usually first two words in the sentence.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you are immediately able to translate the whole sen the whole part, the whole first two words. But then, like, the object is when the model doesn't see the object and it translates, then it n in German, you can if you if you for example have this past tense and then you have this specific past tense, then you cannot recover and you have to put a comma and like subordinate sentence. If you want to recover.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And for that you need to use like that like in translation that, or something like that some connection between these two sentences to make it more fluent. And that's why you are actually translating then more words than less.",
            "Makes sense.",
            "But this is just one example. You could find more I guess. Then as you said, these there are these compound words. And. If and n you cannot sometimes pro translate the same English word, because which like one English word can have like many meanings, depending on the context.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And and for example, in German it might have a different translation in different context. And then o again, if you don't have the context, you first translate to something, that is for example more probable in general. But then if you get the context and then you see okay, I shouldn't have translated it as this word, but rather as another, then you need to recover from that. And then again you need more words. So like so I think that like it's a paradox then. If yo if you want to low latency, you have to actually generate more words.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "At least at least to be correct. So.",
            "Yeah. Oh oh by the way, PERSON7, do you have any idea if? you would also be organizing IWLTS 2023? I'm. I'll be helping around? with 23, I think.",
            "You will be helping?",
            "Yes, me and there is also? the PERSON8, I don't know if you heard about that. PERSON8.",
            "I don't think so.",
            "Yeah, so, she?, so she asked me like if I mean if I'm doing it, we can also help organize?.",
            "Well, actually, I don't know. We'll see. Well, I don't know. I don't know.",
            "Yeah, well, it's too early I guess. It starts somewhere in July, August, I don't know. August? September? Like, preparation for the.",
            "Yeah,. Well. Well, I don't know when it starts in general, but I joined in I think the end of the year, like in the beginning of the year, well like in the beg the beginning of this year.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Actually I don't know. Well we still well. Cause I still have some study which I started and it's not finished yet. And well, we used this evaluation to for IWLSLT. And I don't know like, because actually I wanted to ask you PERSON2 as well that well or like to mention that actually when we I think when we like that we know because now you work with translation system which is which is reach retranslating, right? You know. It's like what it's committed it just committed and you can't change that. But actually well I believe like in PROJECT1 right, there is a retranslating system. Like which? -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So i think that there was the problem that there was a lot of flicker and a lot of changes a lot of upda a lot of updates of the subtitles. And that was also the reason why PERSON4 or like we wanted to somehow redo. Because there was a lot, there were a lot of words which were changing. And so well. It would be better for the reader if there are less words, so the text is like shorter.",
            "Well, like, I.",
            "Well, actually. I'm not sure whether this is. Just one thing. I'm not sure whether like retranslating system is really useful nowadays.",
            "No, I like I in general, I hate the idea of retranslating systems.",
            "Because like I think it's just stupid. Because often I guess the reader is it's not so fast that he can read whatever the system decides to translate every few hundred milliseconds. So. Like. At least when I'm trying to watch like some retranslation system, and I watch the one from PROJECT1 and I think that's like the whole idea of retranslating is stupid, in my opinion. Like like sorry, but I don't I don't see any point in doing retranslating system. I think that we should really stick to non non-re like once committed, you it is there. And I actually think that we should s we should actually try to do and maybe that's next step what I should do is to focus on extreme low latency. Like really forcing the model to output every time or almost every time something, but to make it fluent. That.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The model should know oh well, with this more context I know that I made this mistake, so it should like correct itself in a way human tri human translator would if the human translator would have that much time to think about the mistake.",
            "So again, I mean to make it humanly readable with. Because because this flicker flickering that is really annoying and then you like lost lose focus on what was actually said, because like I maybe this is also a question of someone who knows bet more about a human brain and how we work with informations, because like I think. Sorry, I never thought about it really in deep in depth. But I think that whenever I see a word, like I like put it into my memory and my memory is not the line a linear thing, but it's more like a bag. So I put a word into bag. And and I like connect the things in the bag to like get the like overall image of the word. And I think that's the problem with the flicker like. If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain. And and then I like w lose actually focus and like control what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not. So. So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is not is bad and stupid by definition. And it shouldn't should while one should shouldn't do it. Like. Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have. Even though you cannot promise it's good. But I think that we like cannot work cannot work with this extra information. And I think that if you like I think that maybe like the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it. Like. He if I'm if I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself. And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly. And like even though it just guesses the quality is like okayish, so and I think hat maybe that's the motivation why retranslation was created. Just just the developers of the systems are eager to display information and I think that because we are limited in like the volume info of information we can perceive per some time, we like see the extra information is for us just extra burden. So we should shouldn't should like I think that it's not goo it's not really good to really show extra. Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality. I think that's still better than showing the flicker. Because what like what would be the real use case? Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really? Really? Like from user perspective?",
            "Like technically, when human translators? when they start translating, I mean the goal even their is for annotators they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker. So there are times when they would say something and that would be wrong, so they would just correct itself correct themselves, so.",
            "Well but yeah this mean that what I actually think with like my solution, like you would do not flicker, but you committed it, like there is no way to change, but you correct itself. And that's actually what the translators are doing. They say it. And you cannot unsay thing. If you if you're interpreter.",
            "Yeah, I mean that's the well that's the whole idea behind speech to speech.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And I mean and that's the whole? behind speech to speech? idea. Because well, I mean you're? every once in a while? and since you're already deciding when to speak? I guess that's pretty much the unresolved question in speech to speech. Because you don't.",
            "Yeah, but I think that you just like there is no way how to do it without some latency. Either you will have well larger latency and higher quality or you will just have lower quality and lower latency. I think that there is definitely some theoretical or like some lear real boundary which you which is not limitation of the technic? limitation of like it's natural law.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like you cannot.",
            "Well you cannot see into the future. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Unless you can, you never will be able to translate correctly. And so I think that live speech to speech might be possible. But either with increased space where you will generate whenever you think that is something is almost certain. And then you will need to like increase the pace because then you need w then you want to do this corrections for the for what the interpreters do. So so you will correct yourself. So the system will should correct itself. And but it should be like in some certain boundaries, where it's like you cannot really increase the space I mean two times probably. Like I think.",
            "Yeah, yeah I mean.",
            "That. I mean like increasing one and half time it's fine I think. In most cases. Well it depending on the source speaker of course. But I mean.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For for at least for lectures like I know for myself when I'm watching a video then I'm always watching it on half one and half speed. Regardless. And and some speakers are able to even on two times.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But they really depends. Some some of them is really unpossible to? through to watch two times speed. So, well, and I think that. Like with retranslation I think that even if you like pluck a TTS into it, it wouldn't work, I can imagine like it would be it would be extremely unfluent if you like pronounce the like the unstable hypotheses and then you will just correct it. But you these corrections would be extremely unnatural because what the translators do, they build up fluent sentences, right? Right, they are gra they should grammatically correct. Maybe they are shortened, take like missing some bits of information. But they should be fluent in the in the target language. And and like more or less contains it should contains the same information. So. So I think that for speech to speech, I still I think that the only solution how or way how to do it is to do it without res retranslation. Like.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So maybe to some somehow find a self-balancing system where you like where you set a maximum piece, pace of the of the target audio or target text. And like I think that the more pace you allow, the lower the latency, because then yoiu have like more time to correct yourself.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Or or the model has more time to correct itself.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah like I think that the idea the idea behind the retranslating is that actually like. There is a point where w you have to guess, right? Because you are not sure. You are not sure what will be said. But you still want to display something, so you make a guess. And so if the guess is correct, that it's great. If it's not, then there is the flicker. I think that the idea was that no. If these guesses are very often correct, then it could be probably better to display it immediately, not wait. You know.",
            "Well, I still I'm still of the? when I think here about it? it's a really like a problem of ask of developers that we are not really trying to like use our models to like a translate a some speech for example. And to get the information from the speech. But we are just looking at it at a piece of amazing technology and.",
            "Yeah, well. I'm not I'm not defending.",
            "Like retranslating or anything. Like or I was just wondering that because like I'm not sur because I don't know like I just worked on some like human evaluation so I don't know like what was you know because like these retranslating system was in PROJECT1 like two years ago. Yeah. And I don't know when it was developed, I don't know what state of the art was back then. So. Well. I agree for me personally I think that it's also better to not have retranslating. Because like you proved that really like your model is really good. You know like when you just takes a different model. So I think that nowadays it's. Yeah, I agree with you, but I don't know, probably like. Do you know like two years ago like four years ago what was the standard of the what was the.",
            "Well I actually don't know and I think that the retranslating system is it's a standalone thing. And I'm not really sure if anyone is questioning the validity of this. This approach.",
            "I guess it would?.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I guess it would also have to do how we as humans are more comfortable with waiting more for confirmed sentence. Or just you know. So it's it's basically two-fold guessing. One is when is machine guessing it and displaying something. And then you as a user is watching something. And then you can also guess that well if previous words? and it just says this right now. So it means that translation? something else.",
            "Yeah, but I mean like I think that it's you cannot say that retranslating systems are not stable? because i don't tink that there is like a question what is the state of the art.",
            "Yeah yeah, that's.",
            "It just I think it's just a different approach. And but I think that it's like purely artificial construct. That we have a s w have as developers cre as developers created. And it did not exist before automatic speech translation. And I'm not really sure even if it was ever properly used. Because I'm to be honest I like judging by the PROJECT1, it's not really that useful, right? Right, I mean the quality.",
            "I guess the idea is from ASR that even if you have a hypothesis you display it, and then you self-correct it. So it's just. Well it's basically for PROJECT1 to make sense. Because if you do live speech to text translation, then you also have a hypothesis which is from ASR, so unless your ASR is confident that well. Well unless your ASR is giving out the exact thing it's supposed to with very low latency, because you are introducing latency in two places here, one would be ASR, the another is your MT. So. If you're updating your ASR hypothesis, then it makes sense to also update your MT hypothesis. But yeah. If it's not live text like speech to text, yeah it does not make sense to go to retranslation.",
            "Yeah I.",
            "Because.",
            "Actually like I think that if actually I mean it's it's specifically o not on the interest to do the retranslation in the live case. I think.",
            "Well, I mean. The latency is much higher. So a.",
            "Well but I think that actually I think that like for the user it's it's in the best interest of the user to like stick to something even if it's wrong. And and try to correct it in a like target language fluent way. So. So. When the model sees okay I did something wrong, then it should say okay I think reformulate it. Say okay, though I made mistake something like that. And just to correct it. Or or maybe the model should translate in very safe way that it should translate in very generally. So. With with reduced context it p it should produce like very general translation. And then to specify it with more context for example. And although it won't be like precise translation from of the source, it will be fluent in the target language. And I think that this is what the translators do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They they do not cut off the sentence when they have like better context and like stop in the middle of word and say stop. And and s and restart the sentence but I think that they finish the sentence and then try to recover from the mistake which they did. So and I think that this is something that the computer should do and so there is no retranslation, there is a one translation that whenever you output something, it's already committed, there's no way to undoit and you can just correct it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Within the target language. And I mean that's I think that's the that's the that should be our goal.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So actually,. Actually, when I'm actually thinking about the? I think that. One should do kind of lengthening.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like there would be definitely it would be useful to have a system that could oh yeah, that could it doesn't have to be necessary shortening. But it should it should be more like monotonite monotonization of sentence. So you can you can take a any prefix of the sentence and it should be wh if you if you align the sentences like you write it underneath, then if you take any window then it should be a valid translation. And maybe the output the target should be even longer. But whenever you do the window, it should be it should be valid to translation. Or more or less I think that's what we want to do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we definitely don't want to s necessarily use less words. But but we like we want to use as fluent number of words as possible of course. We don't want to produce like garbage words in between but you want to use it in monotonous way. So I that would be ideal, so every time you can you can translate the prefix of the source sentence.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think that's that's what would create the lowest latency. And yeah. So I think that's the best? approach for low latency.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I already saw some work and I think that if you guys can watch the IWSLT this year, then there is a paper, this one that is doing this kind of monotonous speech translation. And? even. You can actually check the they have made the paper public. On archives. So if you go to IWSLT and there are accepted papers, and you can you can Google which papers are on archive and one of them was this monotonous translation. And so what they what they did is that they like their translation system monotonically translated and then they had like reordering network which reordered the states. And then there was this output layer which was matching the reference, so it was the reference of course is with normal that they tested is not monotonous. So so. Like I'm not really sure about the quality of the outputs, but with some by the authors handpicked examples, it looked good. So but the idea was to make the translation monotonous.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think, that yeah.",
            "I will go. Because I?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I need to finish something, but actually, it was a good talk. About like.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Brainstorming.",
            "Definitely. Definitely.",
            "Varied ideas, so. Yeah. Yeah, I agree that retranslating system like yeah we should focus on other things. I mean if we want to when we want to translate like more live speech. Yeah. So. Okay, so. Thank you very much for the discussion.",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Bye.",

            "Oh, I, I.",
            "Never mind, I, I didn't have a free minute since then, So don't worry. Right.",
            "Okay.",
            "And, and then I'm really worried about PERSON7, If he can actually help us or not, Because I, like, I think he might have started some Ph.D. somewhere, or whatevers, So he, he may be actually much more busy, Than, than we would be hoping for. So it's possible that.",
            "Yes, he was about to move to Canada, I think.",
            "Yeah, So that, that will not make our life easier, But, well, we have to work with this, So, that means that we will lose a, the person to, to prepare the data, So I'm, I was curious how far did PERSON7 get, And that's probably something that PERSON4 should know, right? He sent me a list of named entities, And I have it myself and part to the annotator and he didn't reply, And now after this Christmas holidays, during the holidays, I didn't address him, But, now I see, that probably he's not going to finish it, Because, he stopped, So.",
            "Not responding,.",
            "And I probably, I will just finish it myself and, But it's.",
            "But, but what, well finish, You will finish the annotation, So the yeah, So the annotator has stopped or PERSON7 has stopped?",
            "Annotator has s.",

            "Move forward, And then, get in touch with PERSON7 and double check that he would be able to do the processing, Also at the token level, So this annotation was done at the type level, like word types, And, we need to do the second round for many of the words, The annoted there's you and the annotator should have indicated that it depends on the context. And for these context dependiti.",

            "Yeah, yeah this is something that, that I was.",

            "Was lost somewhere in the middle, I will open agenda now and send you the link so we can write it down.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Where is it.",
            "I think I should also take note of this.",
            "We can write to the agenda, if we find it somewhere.",
            "Or we can actually put it to the, to the master plan, For, first to task on automatic maintaining, the timeline, So we could put it into the share task components, Or we could put it to your agenda, Whatever you prefer.",

            "So, ah.",
            "Agenda.",
            "Adiadam agenda.doc is in the master documents, So if you can check the coffee things?",
            "O-oh, oh okay, So I have found it now too?",
            "Okay.",
            "Ar to a coffee agenda, So, am I in the correct one?",
            "The last is from the middle of December.",
            "Yes, yes, I'm here as well.",
            "Yes.",
            "So five f.",
            "Oh, wait, So I thought, I know that I've disscused this with PERSON7, And I'm not sure if, if we've written this anywhere, or not, So this is, like, get in touch with PERSON7, That's the short, thing, But if he's not responding, Then, like we have to.",
            "Yes.",
            "Recreate it, ourselves, Yeah, yeah the identification procedure, So there's, stages, au, oh,.",
            "I'll be back in 30 seconds.",
            "Yeah, I'll, I'll write the, So, collect, candidates for, enteens, annotate at word type level, candidates without context if they are surely and named entity, are a cannot be named entity and context, are context dependent then in third type level annotations into xml mark-up of the documents, Collect token level, instance is for annotation. Annotate, at word token level candidates in context of the sentence or perhaps in, each occurrence, or perhaps or, exactly at the in full document if, that particular instance is NNE is not NNE and then, insert token level annotations again into the same xml, are the documents, So, at this point, the documents will, contain information like, this word was consi, was suspected to be NNE but at the word type, annotation it was, marked, as regular word. This word was suspected, NP, marked as a clearly NNE in word type annotation, This word suspected NE marked as unclear, at type level, not processed at token level yet, and then, marked as NE at token level, right? So that's, it's this list is not complete, But it illustrates, that, we want to have the, the th finest possible detail about the annotation process, So we need to know exactly what has been touched by people with what result? I'm saying that this, the process, is documented to the finest level. I'm not saying that the distinct decisions are made to the finest level, That's a different thing. So we may be unsure about the particular instances being or not being entities, But we, we always must be sure about the fact, whether someone has processed this or not. So, do you, do you understand? PERSON4, you, you look puzzled so.",
            "Partly.",
            "But, yeah so, so, but PERSON1, Have you read the process? And, it's the is that easy to follow?",
            "No, I think I need to see an example.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I'm really like,",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, So, thanks PERSON4 for the link, to the, annotation, Maybe rename that document, so that it should not be a copy of, But it should say something like annotation at the type level and, and, and so on.",
            "Well this is copy because PERSON7 did send me to the annotation the same file, And that's want to name it, So the idea was, well but.",
            "Okay, he doesn't want to rename it, If it's, if it's agreed.",
            "He, he asked me to make a copy of his document, Not to delete the list, so, so.",
            "That's good.",
            "Accidentally not to lose the information, But the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I just would like the name to be more descriptive for someone,",
            "Okay.",
            "So that it.",
            "Of course.",
            "Like the, the word copy is okay, like it, But it has to, be this copy of that's like just an automatic label.",
            "Yes, proper note is better, okay.",
            "Proper note and then like, personal copy of PERSON4, or whatever, That's like the word copy is, is good, But, this copy of, it's just automatic what, what happens if, if you make a copy,",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay, So, well, the idea, is that an, at the end, we need to have the full collection of all our documents with all named entities replaced by placeholders. We agreed some time ago, in, in you should found out the, the notes on this, Then we will stick to the name tech hierarchy, Perhaps even a simplified one, So that we don't, go into the details of types of named enties, So the, the, the least possibly tail, For some of the entities, like, names of months, We will plan to do them later, Because they're close set, very, very simple ones to, to do,",
            "But they should also be like documented, So the process of the named entity removal, has to be very clean, And, and we have to know at what stage of this process we are. So this would be, the, the small close set, things, They, they would be handled separately and they are easy to do. The hard part are the entities which, like names, or project names, or, or, or words which can't be names and may not be names at times. And we need this process to be like as fast as possible, So that's why I suggested to proceed at the two levels, First at the word type level, And then the word token level. So that's the standard distinction from lexical grafers, Where types.",
            "Maybe I don't understand this, typ, word type level, And what is the difference.",
            "Yeah, so, word type is the word as it appears in the dictionary, And word token.",
            "Uhn, uhn.",
            "Is a particular instance of the word in.",
            "In, in the context.",
            "In a context.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "In, in, yeah, in a running text, So that ', that's the.",
            "So first we, ahn, and now we are working on types, Because I just see the words -",
            "Yes, exactly, yeah.",
            "A, and, after that we will once more something with contexts.",
            "Yes, exactly. So, what we do want to have the annotation of the documents, So that's we do want the token level annotation in the end, But some words like Jan or some clear names, They, like it would be totally waste of time to, to do proc, To do them token, by token. So we can do these words all at once. So that's the word type anno, word or type level annotation.",
            "This is, this is the terms from lexical references, So that's, that's professor -",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Mentions, mentions that the word type and word token in, in one of the early seminars, So maybe, maybe you're too advanced and didn't attended those, those basic seminars.",
            "Yes, it's okay, I just, no I just conne try, Well I needed to connect it to what.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Doing, so.",
            "Yeah, so, so I'm not sure if we will have PERSON7, The, s and he was supposed to be the like system operator, To do the like bulk processing of the documents, And the insertion of the annotations into the xml and things like that, So that is some programmers skill that we, if PERSON7 is, is not available, that will be like seriously in need off, So that's, that's what worries me somewhat.",
            "And especially if PERSON7 will be away, It means that w.",
            "Yes.",
            "We are doing now is actually to finish the annotation, Because this is some procession.",
            "No, no, no, no, no, no, That, that's, like the, someone can pick it up from that point.",
            "Okay, We'll hope.",
            "So there's no.",
            "Understand it could, Yeah, okay.",
            "That's not the problem, lik, you have, What you are doing is, is the manual decisions, That's the value,",
            "Like then, creating such a list again, Is very easy, There could be some small mismatches, When there is tok like one crution marks, But, otherwise, It, in ver in most cases, in, in 99% of cases, These tokens that the, the particular, thing that you have in the list, They will appear in the list for anyone, whoever does it. So this, this distinct. The, the decisions that you make can be easily transferred and, and stored there. So that's the. So,",
            "This collection of candidates that was done by PERSON7, At the stage where the documents, were, When he did it, And the annotation is still proceeding and new documents are still coming, I guess.",
            "But it's really it has very bad quality everything of that. First of all there lot of typos, And.",
            "I get, So ORGANISATION4 once written with, Once written N and so on. At.",
            "Rememb.",
            "Yeah, so this is the, the typos in named entities, Are mainly because of people do the annotators not knowing the correct spelling.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, so I'm just saying I'm looking for the list, There are a lot of different.",
            "Yeah.",
            "-mbrs, really, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, that's.",
            "Dozens, dozens, dozens,",
            "Yes.",
            "And then, also most of the output is not a named entity. 80% is not a named entity.",
            "Yeah, that's because there was probably beginnings of sentences, So all of, the words at the beginning of sentences also got into the list. This could have been better, If name tag was used, And I, I'm not sure, I think that PERSON7 did not use name tag, Because he needed to collect this list quicker.",
            "Yes.",
            "The, the student PERSON8, PERSON8, he used name tag. So there is, quite, big chance, That, if PERSON8 creates this list, It would be shorter, It would not include, named entities, That, like it would not, suspect all beginnings of words to be.",
            "Yes.",
            "Named entities.",
            "And also the multi word.",
            "The multi words ones are also problem.",
            "And never connected, So if you have world war 2, You, you, you will have three words, And so.",
            "Yeah, so these, So that's, al I'll say stages, And then, after that, un, or remaining, or open problems, open problems, and one of the open problems is the, edition of new documents, another big problem is, multi word, entities. These are eve.",
            "And I don't think it in the prog I don't think that the program included all the words beginning from capital. But there are, there ar really not so many. Not so many.",
            "That doesn't, I'm not sure that here include it all. All that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Beginnings.",
            "Yeah, s well ob, final checks. How do we ensure nothing, leaks into the final data. How do we ensure no N I leaks into the final data, and, the open problems will be also this close lists, months, names, of, of days in the week, yeah. And, what I want to say is the, last stage is, the actual din, so replacement of a well actually there they not need be replacement, but actual, actual removal of the original ex, from the documents, leaving just the xml mark up to indicate, here was NNE of, this type, right?",
            "And what is, in unresolved problem is the identity of NEs, preservation of a now, well conferencing chains, conference chains, including the identity of, individual speakers. So, we can, for the, for the summarisation, I think it is important to know, who said what, And when someone refers to someone else. We do want to hide the original name of the person, But we do want to ideally, we do want to keep, That this was like Jane and Peter and then Jane address Peter, And, and so on.",
            "So, we, probably do not need to pr it would be better also to preserve the identity of project names, or whatever. But, I think, we really need to focus on persons, And we can, for the sake of time, ignore the identity, or tracing of the identity of projects, For projects and other thongs we can say like, Here was a project name, here was a project name and, and don't, make it explicit, Whether it was the same project, or different project. So there, there will be a lot of gaps, in this type of output, But I think it's for the sake of time, It's, it's a thing that we can do, We can't afford to, to ignore this, this type of chaining. But we should not afford it for, for the people, right? So, so, for the sake of time, we, can't probably afford to, drop, or to, to ignore, ignore, tracing of, these chains, for project GTC, but we should not, ignore, it for speakers and, persons, referred to. So I, for speakers, I think that, for, for speakers, like, As, utterance, labels, bu fo and persons well I don't, but we should ignore, not ignore for speakers, in both cases, when they, appear, as utterance labels and, when they are referred to in the text.",
            "We.",
            "Maybe sometimes complicated if annotator was already, they identifies they didn't know who is who, So the labels may be A, B.",
            "Yes,",
            "And so on.",
            "That's okay.",
            "Presume the text that they never be the same.",
            "Yes, that's, that's okay, Like there can be errors, This is, there could be person swaps, I don't think the data set for the purposes of summarisation suffer, much, if we.",
            "Yeah, I, I.",
            "People.",
            "That.",
            "We might, tracing, other people, who are only mentioned in the, in the text and, not, taking part in the meeting, So, what I'm saying by this is that if, someone refers to Jane, Jane is not, not a speaker in this meeting, And someone refers to Jane at the top of the meeting, And someone else refers to Jane at the end of the meeting.",
            "The same be.",
            "Well exac we, we, we can afford to ignore, that, that tracing.",
            "We don't have to discuss whether this is the same Jane or different Jane, We can say there was some person in the top, There was some person, at, at the end. And, that's the same like i, is checking if Bill Gates is this Bill Gates or different Bill Gates, So we don't have to do this type of annotation. We, we I, I suggest that we ignore it. We do it only for the speakers. If we can.",
            "How do we know if this is the speaker, or not?",
            "If we don't, we don't, never mind.",
            "Because actually, if the labels of.",
            "Yeah, if the labels are A, B, C, that's what you said, Let's leave it as, like let's leave it nonlinked.",
            "That's, that's okay. Yeah, so, so actually our main worry is that some true named entity will leak into the data. Our lower or less important worry is whether we preserve the identities, And I'm happy to, like do errors in the second part, But I would be werry unhappy to do errors in the first part.",
            "Yeah. So, this is the outline, And, we need to put this outline on, time frame, And.",
            "And person frame.",
            "And person frame, yes. So get in touch with PERSON7 and check if, like this is what was discussed with him, And maybe it's, it's in, in some document with him, I'm not sure. So please get in touch with him and, extract from him the information if, if he can do this for us. And if not, then we have to do this ourselves. And in that case, that probably falls on PERSON1 for, the programmatic parts, I'm, I'm afraid. So that means that you may need to offload some of your, the water modelling ideas or, to, to PERSON3.",
            "We still have time, I'm not like so worried, like I could, I could, I could deidentify this, If I had a week of, if I could lock myself in a sanctuary for a week, Then I think I, I will have, anonymized the, the corpus myself, Like it's, it's not to, If you do it, with clever, text editors and, and combining scripting and all that is, Our data set is not too big.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's, it's doable.",
            "Yeah, I think, I think like I'm not, like certain in many things are still not clear to me,",
            "I will, I wil I will have a session with PERSON4, With the data how, like what is the input and what should look like, Once I have that, then, then it will be easier for me.",
            "Yeah, so I.",
            "So what.",
            "What I'm thinking of is for example for the token level annotation, If I were, if I was doing it myself, If, if, if, if I locked myself for that week, It would be a few VI macros and I would be just hitting F1, F2, F1, F2, F1, F2, F1, F2, And that would be the token level annotation, And it would be done for document, like very quickly. So it's, I'm not so much worried, I think it's, it's doable, But it has to be a skilled person in, in this, like, text processing. It's a special type of text processing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so that's, that's the deidification procedure, What is, equally important, is the, the identification guidelines, And potentially, some new concerns, Will be, will be added, Like, after PERSON4 discusses this with PERSON6, So this is now my question on PERSON527, Whether you have already, date set when to talk to or call or meet PERSON6? So please.",
            "Nothing.",
            "Please do. Plan something.",
            "PERSON6 is working on, our id the identification from the beginning of January?",
            "Yes, yes, thirty actually. I told her yesterday that she should start, So she.",
            "And she, she has time and sh.",
            "Well she will have to, make the time for that, So she is still on number of, projects, And, but I, I really think that.",
            "And where should I, so what do you, what do you mean. That I.",
            "So she needs to.",
            "Yeah, she.",
            "Yeah, she needs to work, yes.",
            "She, she needs to read the regulations, That will take her some time.",
            "About how deidentificate the.",
            "Abou what this person. So we don't know exactly, I don't know what exactly is person leida.",
            "So she have has to decide, What should be actually anonymized.",
            "Yes, kind of. The way, that I set it up now in the, the, the, in the procedure, That we discussed here, That is based on my intuition, But I.",
            "Yes, so, so she has to say if we have to delete also the names of languages.",
            "For example.",
            "Well, so this is one of our basic questions, So this is actually.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I would very, I would be very happy, If we leave it, if we don't anonymize it so.",
            "Leave English, German, Czech, and don't.",
            "Yeah. Mix it up, Because it's, at least some information that could be preserved in the minutes, So actually, if we have some, well,",
            "We can always do, mock, named entities, So if.",
            "Yes.",
            "So for example for the languages, We can shaffle it, and we would say Romanian instead of French in all cases, And.",
            "Yes, yeah, of course, But one, one more thing that we should aline, the transcript with the minutes.",
            "Yes, that has to be done this, this, the identification has to be done on both, of course.",
            "On the same way, So that we.",
            "Exactly the same way, So the, what I'm talking about a document, I mean either the transcript or any version of the minutes.",
            "So we have multiple version of minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "So a document is either the transcript or any, any minute version for that particular meeting.",
            "So document is any text, in, in the collection. That is very important, I like, yeah. It seems natural to me, But we, we must not forget about this.",
            "So, one question I have, like, so this should be done, Especially on the aliter data, right? So we don't need to do this on ilupar?",
            "No, not at all. So you.",
            "Not at all.",
            "Not at all, Your part doesn't go through this at all.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, back to PERSON6, I'm waiting for PERSON4 to finish.",
            "I'm just to this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, back to PERSON6, So please get in touch with her as soon as possible, And, agree on timeline with her, So she will definitely need some time on, reading, for, for reading the, the regulations, The keyword is, indeed person data. She needs to tell us, what exactly is person data, And all person data must be removed, Absolutely removed, the, the data set has to be free of personal data.",
            "That wil she's like, she will have various concerns, We, we need to like, discuss with her what is, what is this. So that, from that, discussion from her survey of, of the regulations, The guidelines, will follow, ¨. The guidelines will be the result, And the guidelines will say, things like person names must not appear in, in that, And we will then check, if the procedure, which we are already running, is in line with that or if anything else needs to be included in the procedures, So that the guidelines are satisfied.",
            "I think that, this aren't all personal data. Things like months and language.",
            "Yes, I agree that these are not personal, data, But she should check, Like I kind of think about it, it's.",
            "Yeah, so, so that's the guidelines, And, yeah, this, agree on a timeline, exactly, So I think that the, the annotation can go independently, And there will be, in, as the last, There could be like a secondary or territory, or, or final annotation stage, Where we would be still removing something which, like, we have been thought of and PERSON6 has found it out. It's.",
            "You mean the annotation of what?",
            "The, when I say annotation now I mean the identification,",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so, and then the other thing that PERSON4 needs to discuss with PERSON6, is the consent forms, So that we do it.",
            "Something totally different.",
            "That's something totally different, It's very closely related, But, expl.",
            "But this is what, PERSON6 actually doesn ’ t know at the moment.",
            "I send an e-mail to her this morning mentioning.",
            "These two things. She kind of, was expecting this so, so, we discussed this before, so it's not.",
            "Because I have also showed so many times this consent forms, This is totally new.",
            "And she will demand for kind of piece of time for that to.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly, yeah, So, with this we are in some time pressure, But not, not any worse time pressure than, like a month ago,",
            "So we have to decide, how, what should be included, yes?",
            "What should be the wording of the consent form.",
            "And there two types, to, to, like, two stages of the content forms, This is new compared to the beginning of the project, Where we thought we would have only one consent form, Now we have two consent forms. The first one is, the one that we are using, Where people like give us the permission to work with the data, And we need primally now the second one, And the second one is we, er, are getting the permission to publish the data in the deidentified form.",
            "So it means that we should try to forget everything, that we did before, And do, again from th ze from zero, That first the first consent form, create it, Which agrees with, kind of working with our data, And then, create the second consent form, about publishing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And give all the participants of all meetings, both consent forms of the same time at the same time.",
            "No, no, no. We, so actually, we do not need to redo the, the first.",
            "We do, because we have, we have the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Kind of our consent form, Our existing consent forms are about publishing actually, mostly.",
            "Yes, but they are not, and people didn't read.",
            "Yes, of course they are not perfect.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they are signed by 30% of participants.",
            "Yeah, that's, that's the problem. So, people who have not really signed those, We are processing their data without, having received the, the consent. Hopefully they will give us the, the consent now, So.",
            "Yes, mostly we proceed, their data with the oral consent.",
            "Yes, that's good, So that's, yeah, that, that's, we have at least that.",
            "And, so I would now with PERSON6, I would focus on the second form, Which is the consent to publish the data, And this, consent, will be complemented with samples, So, ideally, every person would have all the meetings that he was taking part In, He could browse them and, check himself if, like, he is still represented in that or not. It would be.",
            "So in th.",
            "As deidntified, So he should not be able to, like feel identified, But he would know the, the content, So that's, the,",
            "So why not to forget about the first phase, in this case.",
            "Yes, so let's, let's totally ag like forget about the first form, For the purpose of the release of the corpus, And let's come to the first form, only once the corpus is finished and released, And let's, do this first form for the new meetings that we will still be collecting even after that. So I that was my proposal as well, Let's really focus on the second form now, To have the permission to publish the data in the anonymised form, And, and later come to the first form again, Because we will still be reaching out and trying to get more people provide us with meetings, And there, there we will need the, the first form, And the first form will be on the, the consent to process the data and deidentify it with the forcing goal of publication, When people will be asked with the second form again.",
            "Well, I'm just thinking about this, samples,",
            "Yeah.",
            "If, so with, kid of prel openly said, If we really need all these samples for, people we are sure about, like you and PERSON1 and so on, So, shoul.",
            "We can simplify it also by, like giving everybody the full dataset, Access to the full dataset, like brows this, you are prob.",
            "Is it the consent form? So I'm kind of, I am a little bit lost in what should be done. So.",
            "So.",
            "Really should prepare the special samples for every consent for every participants, It appears to be the task for the whole year, And I.",
            "Well no it's a little bit of programming and a little bit of evidence, like, who wants to be what.",
            "Okay, but, you know me and PERSON6 will never do it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah. So, I understand, That there is, there could be, like a substantial amount of, s administration so to say, Or, or data management, for this, Which can be skipped, And the easiest way that I see to skip, Is to, prepare the dataset fully deindentified already, As simple, directory with documents, That people.",
            "And give a link.",
            "Could browse, Give a link and people could open these, Then in the, you would st like tell send everybody the consent form, So here is the consent form for you, We need, to, to get your permission to, to publish the data, You have, been, participant of meetings of these days, Or something like that, So that the people.",
            "Can find themselves, If they want to check specifically themselves, And they would, be also av allowed to, to browse any of the data.",
            "Who will do that PERSON5?",
            "So, I think this is like a pre-release of the corpus, So as soon as we have the corpus clean, removed the named entities, It is a matter of like, putting it in a director, Wrapping it in a HDML, or, or, any, any browsable format, So that is very simple, And I think PERSON1 would do that in, in two hours. So the.",
            "The, the preparation of the web page, That people can browse.",
            "Aha, so.",
            "What is, what is the, the tedious part, Is, the, the linking which person was mentioned where, So this metadata that is.",
            "Yes, this is what I'm asking about, yes.",
            "This should be, I hope that this is in your directory structure somewhere that you like, know who was participant of what meeting.",
            "Not about all of them definitely, I have just made a sample. It's a to make it manually, It's very, big task. What I.",
            "Is it can you.",
            "Probably. Automatical extract is from is to extract the names of participants from meeting minutes.",
            "Yes, yes, that is.",
            "Created by annotator.",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yes, and, But sometimes this is.",
            "Incomplete.",
            "You have to incomplete and the names are incorrect, And you have to, some, some and ot and others, And, some people that, the person -",
            "Yeah, so that's, I think, Let's do the best effort thing. So the best effort is to.",
            "Like if you have an annotator, who could review this, If you know that this, meeting participants, information could be wi like, improved, corrected by someone, One of your annotators, If you have like items, which where you specifically know, That this is missing, or something like that, Some manual effort could be invested there, But even if wo do not do this,",
            "Let's just collect it from the meeting minutes, The list of participants,",
            "And then we will say, in the context, cont consent form, Based on. Ow, I forgot to record this meeting. Is that a problem?",
            "No, you're.",
            "It's already recording I guess.",
            "It's automatic.",
            "Oh, okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah.",
            "So that.",
            "You will never forget it.",
            "Yeah. So, even if don't do this, manual refinement of the participants, We have some information on that, And with the consent forms send to Jane or, or Mary, We will say based on our records, You appeared,",
            "You were participant of this and this meeting, Maybe you were also present toother meetings, And, you were accidentally not listed, So feel free to browse any meetings you like.",
            "So if you.",
            "I think we can, what we can do is like, we create a master sheet,",
            "Where we extract the name of participants from each of the minutes,",
            "Yeah.",
            "And give that to the, to all of them, like.",
            "Yes.",
            "You find yourself and.",
            "And check.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yeah, so that's.",
            "That could be.",
            "This is, yeah, I, I don't think the, the sta, the extra step of cutting out the relevant, portion of the master sheet is too, tedious. I think it's, it's doable, It's, it's kind of mail merch, So, mail merch operation. You, you like prepare individualized.",
            "Yeah.",
            "E-mail, so it's, it's not too bad. It, it is a little bit of work extra,",
            "I'll leave it up to you, What you find, like, like the balance between your labor and, and their labor, What is polite and, what, what, what this labor is. So it's I'll leave that up to you.",
            "Yeah, once we have, once we have the meeting IDs and these are the participants, So like, we can easily find to which ID each participant,",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then,",
            "Yeah.",
            "That in, that should be easy. It, it should.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Not take much time to.",
            "And, then, kind of separately of the consent form, We should ask people for bug reports, So this is, this is a big value, When we are sending the people again the links, And when we, know that the people will be again opening these files, Every gase to that, in through that like crowd, it's crowd sourcing essentially, Every gaze into the data set gives us an opportunity to spot other things that should have been anonymised. So they need to have a place where they would record, these, extra observations.",
            "Okay.",
            "And then we would do a second pass, If there we'll see, maybe there will be no more, outstanding, pieces of information that need to be deleted, But maybe they will, And then we'll do like a second pass of the data, And then remove these final things and, and release it.",
            "Yes, so I think, what you are suggesting on this is that instead of the master sheet, We ke we keep one master sheet, But we keep, well from the master sheet we be we clear the individualize it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sheet, and then if they.",
            "Remarks, yeah.",
            "We will have the remarks in the remarks column, And the,",
            "Yeah.",
            "And based on that we.",
            "Yes. So, just please put this on a timeline, We should have a sample document, one meeting or two meetings at most, Ideally, at the end of January, So that we can, put it online s, to the prospective participants of the task, At the beginning of February the something that I suggested in, in an e-mail to PERSON1 this morning, And.",
            "Yes. We need to have the full thing, was it end of March?",
            "Sixteen.",
            "Or 16th of March? The full, the full dataset.",
            "So trying data is sixteen March, What training data first it will.",
            "Probably yes, so end of March.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So please put this, deidentification procedure, And this, check with the consents on the time scale, So I think that, end of February.",
            "I think we should.",
            "End, end of February would be a good date for the participan for the meeting participants, to, to get their, consents, right? Would that make sense?",
            "I think it's doable for us in those, kind of two months, To have almost finished the deidentification, And.",
            "March, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, I think, I think two months would be great.",
            "Two months for us are good,",
            "And then one month, for them to answer, so they wo they should answer within week, And we.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Would have three weeks to, to, finish it, And there is like, a little bit of.",
            "So.",
            "To handle any issues.",
            "So we write the data deidentification, from the participants, By February end.",
            "Sorry, say it again in a full words in full finances.",
            "So yeah, so, the data deidentification conceived from their end should be done by, February end.",
            "No, well, th we have to have the data ready for them to browse,",
            "So if we are able to have the data for them by mid-February, then I would agree with you, I'm a little bit, concerned about it, I think that we will have the data at the end of February, And they should then do the consent, in the first week of February or, or something like that.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sorry, first week of March,",
            "March, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. So, so talking about the timeline, What should be the timeline for this total task, like for the det deindetification. He, yeah well, it depends on whether we have PERSON7 or not, That, that will also like, affect that, the timing, I believe, But I think that PERSON4 will be finished with the word type level annotation, s well, in two days,",
            "Yes, I ha I have written that I will do it till tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So,",
            "It's not it doesn't thousand and the half maybe,",
            "Yeah.",
            "Takes about two hours. Yeah, so then, we need the coding of the xml, Which is item three, and then again, item six. Item three can be kind of delayed if, if inevitable, But it would be, better to do it so that you can also you already use this xml, mark up to, to find, to extract the token level instances, So, I think that the exact timing really depends here on who is doing that, And, the actual remover of the original, text from the document, So the six, six and seven, This should not happen, later than in mid-February.",
            "So, I'll put it here. This, should not happen later or, or this, this should happen, by the end of, by, by the, by the mid of February at the latest.",
            "Where do you writeit?",
            "Just as a comment to that, to, to 2.687.",
            "Aha, aha, okay.",
            "So put it elsewhere,",
            "Just if to the agenda document, I didn't see that, okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay, so, is that it? Or is there anything else we need to discuss.",
            "Well, there is a lot of things I think PERSON1 has created a lot of different things during.",
            "Christmas holidays,",
            "The, the webpage, I like the webpage, Eve.",
            "The only thing I'm not sure, I don't like this changing, are quickly.",
            "That's modern, PERSON4, you're too old, ignore that, I also hate it.",
            "Yeah, yeah just, just like, Close your eyes for that,",
            "So I,",
            "Okay so, I will.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will increase the timer, so don't worry.",
            "Yes,",
            "It will -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And maybe one will think, as you.",
            "Okay.",
            "As you created the Scientific Committee, Why did you include all the Russians, all the Russians in the year, So actually, I'm not sure.",
            "It is.",
            "Should be in the Scientific Committee, they don't even know about that. They are probable participants.",
            "No, no, it is, it is just.",
            "This mock, or is that.",
            "So, it is not finalized, you know PERSON4,",
            "Okay.",
            "So, un, it is not finalized, I've just put the names, because,",
            "Oh, yes.",
            "If they're participating, So they could also be the potential reviewer so they can review others work, right?",
            "That's right, yes.",
            "Yes, but you.",
            "Yes.",
            "Should probably ask them, So if you.",
            "Yes, yes, definitely, definitely, So that's why I.",
            "You the e-mail, right PERSON4? That e-mail template, That we would be, sending to the.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, definitely.",
            "Yes, I do.",
            "If I so, kind of unsure of if we should invite all of these people to the Scientific Committee, Because mor half of them are master's students.",
            "I.",
            "No.",
            "I don't know, yeah.",
            "Yeah, let's, let's leave that open, But I, I think master's students should not be there really it's, it, it.",
            "And I don't know who, and I don't I don't know these people personally, So I don't know who are.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Students.",
            "So this is kind of a special, So, somebody is an autumn, Somebody's already, kind of se, system professors also,",
            "That's our, let's these are clear, look good, And Ph.D. students.",
            "But I don't know who, so it's kind of.",
            "Yeah. Special task to look through this people, And somebody of them have, ORGANIZATION1, ORGANIZATION1 some ORGANIZATION1 scores or something, And some of them do have it, but don't have it online, so it's.",
            "Well, I would suggest PERSON1 that you put this list down, and you will just put to be determined or in preparation in the, in the Scientific Committee, Keep it elsewhere, and we will like discuss this separately. Do we have to have the list for the application?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, that's the problem. Other ways, we could have done it late.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So then, please prepare the text for, an e-mail to the prospective, members of this,",
            "We already did.",
            "Where is that text?",

            "By the way, did you do ANNOTATOR1?",
            "The annotator?",
            "No?",
            "The PERSON3 was supposed to do here on Friday. Aha, actually talk about it - Well, okay, le's wait for him.",

            "Hi.",

            "Yeah.",
            "Oh, okay. Oh, I missed you call.",
            "Yes, I you usually are there on time. So I noticed when didn't came. because everything is fine joing or not.",
            "Oh no, everything is fine. Looks like we have to, like, replan everything now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, the thing is that we are not going for fisher sessions, right?",
            "What is the last mail? I think PERSON1 can translate that for us, what the person has returned?",
            "Uh-huh that czech text you mean, you mean.",
            "Yes.",
            "Oh, nothing serious. I will translate it, that is actually not. \"thank you for the email. We had a tech a technical communication meeting. And, the results are the following, that their papers for special sessions should fill the same criteria as all other papers and the same timelines. So if you want, If you plan to make a special insurance session, you should, Just follow these rules. And if it would be a satalit event, You should do what you want, just to coordinate it with something like umes and two more high, I do not know what's that. Important date is that, okay. The articles are not in the Proceedings of Intra Speech.",
            "So I think the same was written by.",
            "So I actually knew about this satellite event. So this is usually for some full fledged workshop. Not really for shared tasks, which are very focused. But like this gives us much more flexibility and freedom to choose our event, or also like accept papers. But the thing is that we have to do much, like, almost double work, with this.",
            "So that means it is going to be like, we are going to handle the track alone, right, is it so? Or did i understood -",
            "Yes, yes, everything. So it is like a mini conference. It is like a mini conference that you want to do.",
            "Okay,",
            "It is entirely independent of interspeech to program committee. He knows speakers. Everything we have to choose, okay? And then, like inters speech, will only be there, They will just promote our workshop in their webpage and nothing else.",
            "Now, what do to? refine the proposal.",
            "Yes,",
            "A satellite.",
            "The proposal is going to be up there?",
            "Yeah, there, yeah, yeah. There are many things now we have to figure it out.",
            "May I ask you, do you want to do that?",
            "Yeah, we do not have any option right now,",
            "But there. another option is this next conference, I forgot calling or not, calling, something different.",
            "Sick dial.",
            "Sick dial and we can make a shared task. Yes?",
            "Yes.",
            "And why not to do a shared task at sick dial.",
            "I would propose both, PERSON1, we should do both, like we don't know that. If we, if we apply this, we will get eventually accepted.",
            "Then what after if we don't get sick dial like, do we have some other option as well? after sick dial?",
            "Oh we have to go on saying?, we have to go for.? I should be spoken language technology workshop. But I'm strongly feeling from, like whatever on this said that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy. So so, because there is no thing like no concept of speech here. We are directly working on text. So I'm resonating what on this state,. But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us. And the next proposal would come for 2022 would, which would be too late for us. So, any of what I would propose this like. Eventually we have to try and see like. It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community and our like. We can motivate participants to submit. The only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeeches like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, like, like, I am not sure that how much, how much they will be excited to publish a paper in, or archive is a big no. So in archives, people can publish any time, right? So that is not a benefit to their profiles. So how to motivate participants to join our shared task. If there is no endorsement imposing from inters speech. So this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session. But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time that before. The like time periods between proposals, submission and your. Final paper submission was five months, so it would have enough time for our schedule, but this time. It is only three months so. Yeah, that is one here.",
            "May I just make clear one more thing.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "If we made a kind of workshop. So we now make a proposal for the workshop, We either get it or not. If we get it, we are right to our participants. So we make an advertisement. \"Please take part in the shared task.\" Or workshop. So they are suppose during these three months to, write a program. So to make. This. Minuteing somehow. And write a paper also beforehand, During these three months, the year was a separate paper on the topic. At this, together with the shared task. Yes, or how is it does it work?",
            "And so if we are going for special like if you are if you are supposedly accepted for a workshop then we have much more independent than special sessions, so it is entirely up to us then when to float the deadline. How should we do the review process. Everything. So we are free to choose everything for this. But for the special session, we have to strictly follow whatever.",
            "Special session anymore. It's clear. I'm asking about the workshop.",
            "Okay, so what's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "One more thing, which is coming to my mind, is if we have to prepare, like, in three months, like all the, if you are just emailing all the participants to take part into it. And is our data, yeah prepared for it? Because all the participants are going to. Oh, experiment with our data, right? The -",
            "Yes, so I think in three months our data. Like the proposal submission, the last state of submission committing the proposal is. And before that, we have to get an isd endorsement that the speech community is endorsing our proposals, then only we can submit the workshop proposal, and then they will let us know by March fifteenth. So by March fifteenth, we know that whether we are, we are accepted in interspeech workshops. And then we have to write our call for proposals and stuff. But before submitting the proposal, we have to get everything ready, like the website our program committee, key notes, the program, everything. And then only, we have to make a full pledged proposal for like my workshop program and then permit, and that would request time.",
            "So, when, when is the date. For submitting the full papers of participants? If we conduct a separate workshop,",
            "I will be back in two minutes. Yes? I'm sorry,",
            "So it should be very much double work.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "Like many things, I, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So right now is the deadline same? for satelite? is it?",
            "No no for.",
            "When is.",
            "For the satelite event it is february 28. But before that, we have to submit the proposal any time. Okay, like as soon as possible and get endorsement. And once the endorsement is there so there is two stage processes. One is endorsement from ORGANIZATION3. And then ORGANIZATION3 endorses, we have to submit, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Submit and then they will pay. So it's a long procces but, but it's okay. we have to now look for proceedings. Take care of all those stuff on our own.",
            "I know since I am like I.I I did this for the past year. It is too much heavy.",
            "And so anyway, we have prepared the this document. We can send.",
            "-it to sigdail no? for the shared task.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "And they, if they.",
            "January 15.",
            "If they accept us both to sigdail and. This interspeach w.",
            "Interspeech, we do both.",
            "What?",
            "Ha ha.",
            "We do both.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Really?",
            "Laugh.",
            "Yeah. See, eventually it will be online. So there is no travel just like we have to manage this submission. I don't think, so. I, I think that better on this will er never better say. But if you are to ask me, I will do both then, because both have a very good visibility.",
            "Yes, but can we find so many participants?",
            "I think so.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay,",
            "I think so, Because since it would be entirely on to us, we don't need place submission. We can even do with five, six submissions.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like, I've seen workshops in esl? having two or three submissions only. So still, they are doing the proceedings and stuff. So that's not a problem.",
            "So You are to go to both. And to begin with. Workshop now.",
            "Yes, yeah, but it, it, but it means double work. That's what.",
            "Yes I understand, but you're very good.",
            "Laugh.",
            "Laugh.",
            "Laugh.",
            "My response laugh.",
            "Laugh.",
            "Laugh.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, okay. He just replied to the email.",
            "I talked to him, and there was some things I am, and so he just agreed.",
            "Yeah. He just said, Agreed. So I thought, That is a new information. new message.",
            "Yes.",
            "Laugh. Yeah, okay,. So I think I need to settle down a bit. Last three, four days, it was too much hectic for me. I like to reorient everything. Okay, so like. The thing is that our proposal is almost a to complete. But we have to take our institutional membership. For, like for like for all of us, to submit to the ORGANIZATION2 workshop application portal. So for this, I need I shoul like I should contact,",
            "I missed the point, sorry.",
            "So we have to take membership to submit the proposal.",
            "What is membership?",
            "Membership to ORGANIZATION4.",
            "I don't know, really, Don't ask me about these administrative plans. I have no idea.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So I can make the data. I can read the texts, but I can never. So I understand this organizational points.",
            "Okay, no, I'm just asking, hold on, yeah, Well, we have to pay some fees somewhere for our workshop. To whom should I ask like if we have to ask on the right.?",
            "Yes, Aha, Andre and Hero for what.?",
            "Okay, okay, I got it. So we have to pay two, fourteen rows for institutional.",
            "Membership.",
            "Yes, I think it's not a problem at all. But, ask PERSON4.",
            "Okay, okay. So do we want to discuss about the proposal content for the workshop now or?",
            "No, I don't know what.",
            "Okay, so let me prepare this as part of the content that is required. I have to study some other satellite events that I got accepted to an interspeech last year. so we have to again reorient this thing.",
            "And the additional thing we have l we have to do management, and, management and specialy we have to the program committee now. and make a website for our propo for our shared task.",
            "Yes.",
            "And what else? Interspeech?",
            "So really big work.",
            "Noise.",
            "All? of it.",
            "And and another thing PERSON1, so can you tell us a bit more about? And I will, I'm like not aware of this german?.",
            "Noise I would pr. I would rather advise you to Google it. I do not know much more.",
            "Oh, okay,",
            "And I'm not really interested in all these points. I've never searched so that?. So may I probably published there something once or twice. But oh, I didn't make a resea a research about what so.",
            "Ufal? Okay?",
            "Pro I don't know, probably not just, it probably has some points, I don't know which points, really, don't ask me about it, I don't follow it.",
            "Either Google it or aks PERSON4.",
            "Yeah i got it.",
            "TR?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Things that I never understand.",
            "Okay so PERSON4 is the technical, so it makes sense.",
            "Yeah probably, yeah, I'm very antiorganisational type.",
            "Which journal?",
            "Noise PROJECT2.",
            "Oh.",
            "-Linguistics.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay,",
            "Are you aware of this?",
            "Yeah, yeah, actually very good paper machine translational publishionate?, so I've -",
            "Oh, is it?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So do you think that like the participants would be interested for our publication? in the in this in this journal?",
            "Depends on depends on the participants actually.",
            "Oh, because I have never heard of it.",
            "I know I have in like in my researcheration?. I have read lots of papers, lots of publishioning?",
            "Oh.",
            "So I think machine translation.",
            "Maybe mostly focused on machine translation.",
            "Yeah yeah, so that's why I think I have experienced it.",
            "But it is very old. It was published in 1964.",
            "Yeah. Yes, actually the like all the statistical machine translation?, all the papers. The core papers were actually in this. So, red.? But those papers this.",
            "Okay.",
            "So they can be interested. You know, it depends upon person to person. So if he's aware of this, then I think he can be interested in. If he's not aware, then probably, I dunno.",
            "It really depends.",
            "And is it indexed? Or, let me think -",
            "I think it is indexed. like it is indexed in like all Google's call? and all that. But let's give it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Some. I think. editorial board members are really interesting to see.",
            "On the you there?. so that's good.",
            "On the you there? Keyboard sounds.",
            "Anyways. So I think. This would be easy for us, like if we have to do pvml.",
            "Yeah, even if you see to the website of it, They have mentioned.",
            "That machine translation corpus linguistics and morphologies in Texas, semantics? is what is -",
            "Yeah, but I'm trying to look at the where it is indexed. Because, you know, like to a new person,",
            "Yeah.",
            "They would probably see go for where it is indexed.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So same? bblt? it? is not indexed. Keaboard, distant noise.",
            "It is not mentioned on the website, I wonder why. Keyboard.",
            "So one good thing for going for sigdial would be, if we go for sigdial, The proceedings would be indexed with ethylanthology.",
            "That's a g that's a good positive point.",
            "I would say that sigdial is better than interspeech workshop. Less work.",
            "Yeah, less work.",
            "Less work and intent more intensive output.",
            "Yes, I agree. Okay, so it is indexing Google Color.",
            "Yeah, Google's car I have seen. So despite of that I don't have. Noise.",
            "So it is the Muslim machine translation. It is already written in there.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "In that description. Okay,",
            "Yeah, And core energetic, like.",
            "Linguistics morphologies in t.",
            "But I don't see any kind of like proceedings in this journal.",
            "Proceedings., yeah.",
            "Proceedings of any.",
            "Yes, yes,",
            "Workshop.",
            "Yes, yes. Any kind of conference or of Yes, Yes,",
            "Okay, but I think if we are to do it on, January 15th? of that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "Did he mention some email?, did they skip? something? Did he mention that we are going to publish it. -",
            "Yeah, he says, that either, either we can go for archive, or we can go for pvml. So, archive is, is no, because, yeah, it. It won't motivate anyone to submit.",
            "So I think pvl is very famous to the entire machine translation community at least.",
            "Community, right.",
            "So, yeah, so not aware of summarization and all people. So.",
            "Yeah, that's the point -",
            "So maybe we can try -",
            "I, I kn I know something called PROJECT1 from elsevier.",
            "So if you have any something where they host, they like they can host, the proceedings of some conferences or workshops, but I'm not sure that if they will charge for that, and if they charge, how much is the charge.",
            "Also has some specific those, for the, like a what they have, the journals, specific journals. Like this,?",
            "Like applied science and something there are after a certain there is specific something. So are you talking about something specific or -?",
            "No. I'm talking about thisestering as severe conference proceedings from El Severe. Let me post the link. Keyboard.",
            "And where is it indexed?",
            "It seems a bit it will get indexed in Cosmopile Google color, all the major conferences.",
            "Okey maybe you can ask Ondřej, I think, about this.",
            "Yeah, let me let me connect to -",
            "That index, I guess, so?",
            "Yes, it will definitely be because it is, but I think it will also be indexed in others like or something.",
            "Noise. Breath. Noise. Like, if I would have been so, I would have? actually preferred bbl over ssr. -",
            "Pvl over ssr?",
            "Yeah. Because actually I've read like papers, so I have a very good image of pvl.",
            "Oh pvl, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can understand.",
            "The quality of paper is very good, and yet, have read.",
            "Yeah, for machine translation?",
            "Yes.",
            "Breath oh, okay. Keyoard. Noise.",
            "Pvl is also open indexed.",
            "Open.",
            "Yeah, open access, and, it is indexed by directly? of open access journals.",
            "Okay, you checked it?",
            "Yes, I checked it from the website of.",
            "Keyboard. Okay.",
            "Hat can be one positive point about that it is open access.",
            "Yes. Okay, so.",
            "But.",
            "Another thing, another thing that we can do, but i have to ask, like we can we can also do it as part of the. I think so, I have to ask my other coeditors, if that is possible.",
            "So has a very big visibility among the community. Okay, so I think maybe we can differ this discussion with PERSON4. He would propose something better,. Anything else we had to discuss today? I think it was mostly the proposal, right? So that we are not doing, so we have to revise this and leaves down the thing that we need to do for the satellite event. Okay. Then then meet tomorrow then? Maybe by tomorrow, I can come up with something that what are the additional works, we need to do.",
            "Yes. And, yeah, thank you very much for willing to do that, I'm sorry that I can't help you on this stage, so I really, I have -",
            "No, no, it's absolutely okay PERSON1, like -",
            "I will be really glad to help in some potential things, I will, really, I will be glad to read the proposal and to write some chapters to the proposal, so -",
            "Yes, sure, PERSON1, sure, sure.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Your, your input is absolutely at every point. The only thing is, like, everything is okay, the only thing is we have to do double work, that's,. Otherwise everything is fine.",
            "Yes, yes, unfortunately it's double work. Okay, thank you.",
            "Oh, okay, okay. So we meet tomorrow.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You too, you too.",

            "Sorry for coming late. I was in the discussion with PERSON9. PERSON9 is also going to join us in a second. And that was on the models that we need. So like, what exactly do we want to further improve for the for the purposes of our project. So this is our last call before the Christmas. And, I would like to hear about the status of the delbls. I know that I'm myself late with some parts. But since this is the last check, then, yeah, what we need to know about all the problems. And then I would like to, which is still not in the agenda. I would like to briefly discuss our experience from running the sessions, the PROJECT5 session that we had and the PROJECT4. So that was a harsh week about two or three weeks ago. So what is. What is your experience? And I would like to discuss the foreseen sessions, and how do we go about them so that like we are. We have stabilized expectations from everybody. So these are my. Main points. And I would like to hear if yeah nobody complains. Yeah, so what else is in the agenda? The payment? I hope it's, it's good. I hope that you have received, the money. Is that correct? I assume.",
            "Yes!",
            "Yeah. Then. Yeah, so that is, I will move this one, so upcoming sessions and we'll start with the delbls. So, PERSON9 is probably still stuck in that other call. So maybe PERSON12? PERSON12 are you here? Do we have.",
            "Yes!",
            "Yes. Tell us what is the status of the report of multilingual machine translations.",
            "It's almost complete. It's ready for review. And I'm waiting for more imput from PERSON14.",
            "OK, that's, that's good. Then. The, status of the report on integration.",
            "Okay, it's done for the per voice site, we are waiting for PERSON17 to,",
            "Yeah.",
            "To back. If, if his if his work is correctly covered, and.",
            "Especially to provide the numbers. So we have agreed that PROJECT2 test set is like the critical component in the evaluation and our, knowledge about the older systems that we have, PROJECT2 test set is, as such as the dataset is described or going to be described in the / D one point five. I think it's. It's fairly described already, and that it is going to be used, and, scores on PROJECT2 test set will be reported in D six point three. So that is still not there, right? Do we have there some table, which would say we have these systems deployed in the mediator and their scores for these language pairs are this and that. Do we have that or not yet?",
            "Okay, I'm going to check it.",
            "Yeah. So please make sure that we, we have this because we have been explicitely asked at the review, on what grounds are you going to choose the actual systems for the sessions. And my answer to that was, we are collecting PROJECT2 test set, and we will run all our systems on PROJECT2 test set, and based on the numbers, we will choose. So. For. For this. I've been asking PERSON17 many times already, and he is struggling with that. But, PERSON15, if you also, get in touch with PERSON17, and make sure that he manage. He manages to evaluate all the systems that are available in the mediator, that will help.",
            "Okay, I confirm you that it. There is no table, in the at the moment. We are also waiting for PERSON8, PERSON8 contribution in conclusion. PERSON8?",
            "Yes.",
            "Did you complete your part?",
            "Not yet, but we will do it today.",
            "Okay, thank you, thank you.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "After that, we should have finished.",
            "Yeah, so I will. I'm the reviewer of this anyway. So I'll also, like, help PERSON17 and push PERSON17 to, have the numbers there, within this week, so that I can review it early next week, still before, the Christmas Eve, and, I'll actually do, the review of your parts, PERSON15 and PERSON8, already during this week so that it is not too late for you to integrate any additive that are needed.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "So I'll start reviewing sooner. Okay, that's good. And we now have PERSON9 on the call, so PERSON9, what is the status of D 1.5,?",
            "Okay, so, it is now complete, already for review. So, yeah, PERSON5 has received, an almost complete version with sections for ASR, MT, NSLT, but not including the automatic minuting section, but that is now ready, so I will share an updated version with him, and he can.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, review that final section.",
            "Thanks. Just to double check, how well is PROJECT2 test set represented there?",
            "Yeah, good question. We had, an email discussion about including PROJECT2 test set a while back, and, it's it's not actually included in this one. So we did quite a good job, I think, in deliverable one point four.",
            "Of describing it. But there are possibly.",
            "Updates.",
            "Update we may want to include. Yeah, so yeah, that is. That is not covered currently.",
            "I know that it is this all faults on our part, actually, so. ORGANIZATION2, but please, yeah, make sure that we put it there. PERSON3 is the person who should put it there, and PERSON7 also knows a little bit, but PERSON3 is the main one.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he said he was busy, he rejoined PROJECT2 from the beginning of. For just 10 hours a week, so not much. From the beginning of December. And he said that he was busy recently, and for example today, he should be able to work on that, on PROJECT2 things again. So please get in touch with him again, and extract that from him.",
            "Okay, yeah, great.",
            "Thanks. So that's delbls, I think they are in, like, reasonably good shape, and I'll make sure to submit them before the end of the year, on the New Year's Eve at the latest and, for the milestones. Yeah, so I would just like to hear from ORGANIZATION3. I know that, English, entering system is out there. Hopefully we will have it evaluated on PROJECT2 test set by PERSON17 as well. This is part of the, like, the table that I wanted to see there. I know that yesterday the German and to-end ASR was deployed, because we. We have asked for that for other purposes. And PERSON12 is reporting some minor bugs with that ASR system, or some minor problems. Some characters are not produced correctly, like accented characters, which are not native to German. But the previous system did have that. And there are other minor things so that can be relatively easily fixed, I believe, and it's normal, so it's it's OK. So I would like to check what. What is the status for the other languages, how the training is going? So PERSON18, your.",
            "Well, PERSON11 is the one to ask, but he don't seem here on the call.",
            "Yeah.",
            "My last status is they were still training.",
            "|, they are definitely still happening, and what we have new is on the MT side, We have, Let me confirm. We have English and German to German, English, French, Italian, Spanish.",
            "So you had.",
            "And according to Li, by the end of the year, we should have five to five. And there is plans for more, but. I have not heard from him whether that five to five is ready yet.",
            "OK, so that means that so, so the two to something was English and German into.",
            "English, German, French, Italian, Spanish.",
            "English, German, French, Italian, Spanish. Ok, so this one is surely ready. And is it deployed, or not yet? It's only on your disk, right?",
            "So we had it deployed, at one point, Let me see if it is still running.",
            "So this. This is an important piece of information that we should have had actually.",
            "It is integrated with the with the mediator. I'm not sure whether he is running at this very moment, but, I, can I can make sure that it is.",
            "So that single model actually amounts to, not ten, a little bit less than ten workers, right? But obviously you dont run these ten workers at the same time because of, Hardware constraints, or.",
            "I think, for one test, we did run most, if not all of them. But yes, and in general, we, we like to avoid not running all of them.",
            "So now this is.",
            "If you want to run some tests on evaluation, we can, we can do it, no problem.",
            "Yeah, so definitely I would like this evaluation to happen. And,. So we should have had this information. I should have included you in the call we had with PERSON9, the previous hour, where I was talking to another colleague of mine, PERSON16, that he should evaluate the various models and he should also. We agreed that we're going to do English to five models, for, we'd do this 9 times, to cover the 43 target languages. The 5 target languages are not too. The, the choice of them is not too critical, we know that it. Like, if they are related, there is a slightly better performance, but not much. So this is what PERSON16 will be working on. And before starting to train this models, he will evaluate, what is there, available in the consorcium, so he should also evaluate your, your models. And now the question is, these are. Are they PROJECT3-based or not?",
            "No, they are.",
            "Yeah. So then the easiest way to evaluate them is actually indeed through the mediator, so I will ask PERSON17 or PERSON16 to get in touch with you, so that you synchronize and run the models as, make them available as workers. And, PERSON16 or PERSON17 would get the outputs and evaluate those models, right? And this five to five model is not that has not been finished, possi probably, and if it has been finished, then it is still not integrated, righ?",
            "Again, cannot, cannot confirm.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. Ask PERSON17 or PERSON16 to evaluate this. And now the question is on PERSON15, if there is any possible optimization so that, I expect the answer is no, but I have to ask. So that ORGANIZATION3 does not have to deploy ten workers, if all of them are based on, on the same multilingual model. So the model is English, German into English, German, French, Italian, Spanish. And we want to cover all the pairs, but we do not want to, to have multiple workers for this. What could we do?",
            "Probably the, computation power is not spent to run the mediator, but actually to run the, the technology.",
            "The models.",
            "Yeah, the models. At the moment, no, there is no possibility to let a worker provide more than one finger printing, put fingerprints put fingerprints there. But it's. Actually it's planned. It is not done yet, but, it's planned in order also to, support the multiligual services of. So a plan.",
            "Yeah, so, and when is this plan like to materialize?",
            "It's. It's a really good question. I, I, can't, I can't answer yet. Sorry. I don't know.",
            "Yeah. So like what. There'll be again an PROJECT2 call in January. So, would the plans be more concrete by then? Or how do we want to proceed? So.",
            "Okay, no, okay, we can try to put the plan on the calendar, and maybe, share some, some deadline together.",
            "Yeah, so let's. Because I think it would be useful saving for especially the partner's resources, because then. PERSON6 I agree!",
            "Yeah. It would be only like a run time collision that we would have to avoid. So, like, if we would ask for a German to Italian worker, then the, English to Spanish worker would disappear as well. So then we would like know, what to release and what to what to ask for, so that we, we can, step by step, do all the translations we want. PERSON6.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that's an interesting, message that you are planning this at some point.",
            "But we can already do it. We do it with Rinbark multitarget models, the rainbow.",
            "So what do we. So, no, but here is two different sources. So what. What what we can do immediately. Right, that's correct. So what do we can do immediately is that ORGANIZATION3 will deploy that two to five system as a pair of workers, where one of those goes from English into five, and the other goes from German into five. Right?",
            "Well, German into four.",
            "German into four, yes.",
            "It doesn't do German to German.",
            "Yeah, sure, yeah sure.",
            "Yes and by the. I checked the models are running right now. So the two to. Two to five is running.",
            "Okay. So, that, that. So in which way are they running then, in the multitarget, or individual?",
            "No, they are. They are running as individual workers.",
            "Okay. So there is six workers, no, eight workers, wait, two copies of each, actually.",
            "Okay,",
            "Not necessary.",
            "Okay, so, sixteen, sixteen workers.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, that's great, so I'll I'll.",
            "I mean, yeah, the when they are idling, the main resource they are using is memory, which there is enough of to run these, but probably trying to run all that actually put load, and all 16 would not work. But the only way to find out that is try them.",
            "Ok, yeah, that's good. So I'll talk to PERSON17 and, we should evaluate them, very soon. Yeah. That's that's good. Okay. So that will, So please. So to summarize, we got into the discussion, by talking about milestone number twelve, which is called Improved ASR systems, and, please keep me posted. PERSON18, ask PERSON11, because we don't have PERSON11 here, what is the status of, of the languages there, of the training of the E to E. And I would really like to hear from you before the end of the year, that I can tick this off, I have done this ticking off previously, but I'd really like to have the languages there. I don't know if it's. If it's conceivable. I think when we talked about, this milestone two months ago, PERSON13 was. Was quite hopeful that all the languages will be finished in some form before the end of the year. I'm not sure if these hopes still hold. But yeah, keep me posted.",
            "Yes, I just wrote to Tyson, I will see if I can get him to respond within the time.",
            "Yeah, we got that improvement in a machine translation system. That's good. Systems. That's good. And we will evaluate them. Hopefully we can sneak these numbers also into the, integration delbl, so the 6.3. So, PERSON15 please put that on, like, the checklist for the delbl, too. Make sure that the table by PERSON17, which is still missing, also contains the translation for English into four, and German into four.",
            "Okay.",
            "By the, way, we tried before to evaluate the, the workers which did not, work, because, the text client that they were using to test it by default just pushes all the sentences right away. And the workers are not designed to do better processing. So they, what they do internally is when they receive sentences faster than they can process them, they and the sentences just get longer and longer. And then the system does not manage to translate it at all.",
            "OK.",
            "So I pushed a fix to the text client, which allows you to run it in real time mode, which means it actually uses the time stamps from ASR to push the text updates, which means it will take as long as the as the original talk did to transmit, but it will not stole the worker.",
            "Um-hum, yeah.",
            "Yes, it is a side effect of running the worker as a as a worker, and not as just a package of the software.",
            "But just, when we are running that evaluation, make sure to use the rigs.",
            "Okay, yeah, well, I'll I'll check if PERSON17 knows where the fix is, is located.",
            "In the official repilitories.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yes, don't worry. I'm going to remind it.",
            "Yeah, updated text client. Yeah, okay. So that is the ASR system and the improve models from ORGANIZATION3. The next milestone that I need to tick off is the improve spoke language translation prototype. And there we agreed that this table that has to appear in these 6.3 is our main bases for ticking this off. So as soon as the table is there, I will tick that off. Yeah, OK. And, So if you have still any, any comments, if you have any suggestions how to make the end of the year more enjoyable and less stressful, then let me know. Yeah, otherwise we just proceeded somehow. Yeah, and then, I wanted to, just mention the upcoming sessions that we. Have, and PERSON1 has entered one. So PERSON1, please briefly report on this.",
            "Okay, so, there is the trade fair of the students companies which we have attended not this year, but the previous year, some of you were there. This time. They are organizing it, but only online. So they have not specified the platform so we're still unsure if it will be over Zoom or what they will use. And, basically there will be the same competition. So last time we joined with the competition 90 seconds in a lift. And, when I, then spoke with the organisite organisators of the competitions, Their main, comment was that as the students were there, and they had to take the headset so we could record them so that it was slow. Now, since it will be. Since the whole thing will be online, so this main issue should disappear. So I think. I haven't contacted the person responsible for the night of. For the competition 90 seconds in a lift, yet. But I think that since this problem should be already solved by the participants having their headset already. Then. That we could again record it. Record them and then prepare another, test or set of speeches of non-native speakers who use English. The. As I put there, the trade fair will be in March. And. Yes, I do not know if you want to know anything more. We will have to do. Also, all the student companies are required to prepare their boot in their school. So, we might also do something, something at our university because last time, we tried to promote there PROJECT2. Not entirely sure what was the impact. But yeah,.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's it.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So I see this fair as an important possible source of like, non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set. So I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to. But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact, for us. It is more important, to make, to use it as a test session. So we should focus, PERSON1, on the PROJECT2 Clearest voice, and the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there. And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and, we need to check their plenary program, and, what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program. So that would make it a test session for us. And for our own presents at this fair, I don't think it's too important. So if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but, if not, then, I think, it is. Its definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and, like, behind the scene, and do our job there.",
            "Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was like slightly compulsatory to have the booth.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. so discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they are. Allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing. The.. the test session is less of an urge. And the booth is just, well, not a waste of time, but, something that really could avoid, if possible. OK, thanks. So then, another session. The sessions are not, ordered in time. The next important session that we have to get ready for the ORGANIZATION5 part 1, that is, going to happen in mid-April, not in May, as originally planned. So it's sooner. And this is. This is the main, the first half of the main event that we have for, for the whole project. So for that we really have to have the best models available, and, due to full bussines. It will be online, So we don't know the technical means yet. And we will synchronize. Maybe PERSON5 can, can say something about the preparations for this. For example, when the agency for interpreters will be known. Is that know already? Or what is the progress there? Yeah, so, PERSON5 microphone normally does not work,... Oh! Okay! So this. I would be kind of surprised that there would not be any interpreters for this session, but it's, it's possible, So, please, figure out, what is actually the... the input languages. The output languages are clear, it will be, yeah, as. So PERSON5 says it's just to have the management bits of, of ORGANIZATION5 completed, and the management bits are the transition. So there was one presidency of the Czech Republic. Some new presidency is coming in. But I still assume that this is high level political, like debate or welcome speeches and thank you speeches, and, I can imagine that these would be run in the six, official languages of ORGANIZATION5 plus possibly Czech. So PERSON5, please figure out, So the task is. PERSON5 needs to figure out the platform, the set of, languages used. Right, yeah. Okay, so we will learn more about this, but definitely, plan mid April, the dates are actually known, So PERSON1, please put the days there if you know them. Please plan that as a critical week. And then the, the other critical event will be. PROJECT5 2021, which will probably happen towards the end of the year. I have not checked the, the schedule yet. It will be similar to this one, except that we will really try to go public and make the, system, used by others. This will obviously be only, non-native English to all our, target languages. And this would be like equally important as, EuroSci. That means like, we need to re. Record feedback, Yeah, write a good report. Ideally measure impact somehow. Yeah. So this is, this is the two big things, that we will have next year, and obviously we will have many more, smaller. Oops, sorry. Many more smaller events. And one of these. Two of these smaller events, one or two of these smaller events, can happen already on January, the 25th of January. I was asked by my colleagues who ran the Center for Visual History of Malach. So the survivors of Holocaust. And they will have a half day conference on January the 25th. So this would be a test session for us again, slightly different domain. There is some data available, we could. We could try to do domain adaptation. Just that... yeah. They have seen our test sessions on one of the Monday seminars, and they ask if we could do it for them. So we will see how the systems will work there. Maybe we will have better domain-adapted systems, maybe just the baseline. And another thing that falls on the evening of the day is the computer-written theater play, which colleagues are putting together the premier of that. And I have heard that the premier is going. It's going to be in Czech but the premier is going to be interpreted with a human interpreter. So I'm thinking that possibly we could like connect to this interpreter and follow the English or connect to the Czech source. This is still very open, but it could be an interesting life exercise and dissemination activity as such. So for you, except us... for you, this is just one more event, such as the Monday seminars or the various sessions that we had in the in the meantime when we suddenly frantically needed some workers running. So the, the only thing that I want to discuss with regard to this is like the management of these events. So if, if the events are the small ones, the test sessions, it's totally our fault. If we do not ask PERSON9 in advance to make sure that his workers will be running and available, and so on. And also, there is no real damage if we do not have the. Do not have the workers available at hand. So please be patient with us and like, don't feel stressed if we suddenly ask you: Oh, we forgot about your worker, and can you possibly get it running because we are not in that stress, either. It's like we are trying it. If we hit you in the right time point, then good, we will get the that test done. If we fail, well, then an opportunity missed for test. So that is not too serious, we will try to be a bit more explicit about the plans. So like most Mondays are these Monday seminars. But now the semester is also finishing, so this will be fewer of these Mondays. So I'll try to make that a little bit more known in advance, but I'm I'm failing with that. So that is the small test sessions. And then there is like a bigger test sessions. And the bigger test session was the PROJECT5 and PROJECT4 set up. And, there, we really need to make sure that we have the partners right, ready and attend to the point. So please put that into your calendars. These two sessions at least, the PROJECT5, somewhere in December, probably. And ORGANIZATION5 congress, part one, so that you know about it, and you are not expect. You are not surprised when I get in touch with you. And the partners have to be like. We have to know what is what is the availability. Any type of problems can happen. We know that, another bomb excavation and other things, we just need to, like, be ready for that and have worker rounds. So that is the main message that I learned from the, the PROJECT5 2020 event that there were points where it was actually my people who were like late to my, to my taste. I would have preferred them to join earlier to the sessions than they did and things like that. So we really need to practice also these preparations. With the online world, it seems that you, like, simply jump into the session, and the work is done. But that is not the case. It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected. So we need to, like, be there earlier. And if someone, if some session that we are doing, is starting at nine, but the organizers meet at like quarter to nine. Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase for the people. So this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what the management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would that would help a little. Another message that is very important is for these important sessions, the recording of that. So I've I've collected. I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any updates to the, where is that? I, I, I had somewhere a document. Maybe I forgot to tell it to all of you. I had a document, like, about the experience from PROJECT4and PROJECT5 2020. And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions. So it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good, good recordings of these sessions. And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording. And even if we will try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever. Then there is the technical aspect of the of the recording. And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex that very often we get. Yeah, PERSON5 is sending that link. I have send it by email, I remember, yeah. So thanks, PERSON5. So we really need to nominate someone who will be responsible for making recordings of these important sessions, and that actually means to test in practice the very platform that is going to be used for that online event. And the very recording device that was going to do the recording. Some of the recordings that, we did, they were without sound. PERSON15 also did something without the sound, maybe on purpose, but maybe accidentally, I'm I'm not sure. It very easily happens that just by switching to another, like, remote teleconferencing program, the recording will not work for this different recording. For for this conference program. So there is no, no full compatibility, at the sound, level, in different operating systems. So this has to be tested for every combination. And then when the recording is actually happening, Yeah, the discs can run out of space, and the files can get accidentally lost. And so on, so someone has to take care of that. So that is my main message, for these events, we will have to have people responsible for recording. So I'll ask for volunteers, then, and just please, yeah, provide your hand for that. Okay, So I think that is everything, from me. Is anybody of you curious about the Malach test session, the holocaust survivors conference? Or is anybody curious about the theater play written by GPT2 and through. And through like auth theater authors. We are in touch with. We have been working on it for several months or a year or more with people from the theater, from one of the theatres in Prague, and the result is going to be like manually revised. So it. It could be fun. So, is anybody curious about this or, or not? Please let me know that will make the importance of these. Of these sessions higher and will do better then. Yeah, so that's the extra sessions, and then, PERSON4 inserted two, two items. So please, PERSON4.",
            "Yeah, actually I mean, the first one leads on from what you were saying a few minutes ago, that, you know, basically just we were talking about this on Monday because on Monday I think. Was it Monday? You were. There was. You were looking for the rainbow workers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and they weren't up and... yeah, anyway. And I think, I think, on Monday, PERSON9 managed to fill it. I think it was last Wednesday when PERSON9 was not available, and I tried to launch, and it did not quite work and so on. But really, and I think we, we had discussed this before.40: 31. I mean, the. To make this, is going to be a bit more robust and scalable, then some kind of would be really useful. And then I had a brief discussion with PERSON7 about it.",
            "And it turns out he is working on this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I do not know what stage or status that is. And I said: Oh yeah, we have some. Have you. Have you. He said, have you dockerized models, and I said Yeah, cause that's. Because two other projects where we have to deliver MT models. We dockerized them. So we have two different sets of dockerization code, they're quite different. So I said, Okay, we have some public models. Here is one. And then he was like, What could you give me a rainbow. Could you do this with the rainbow model? I said, Okay, that's that's feasible. I just wanted. We should do something more at a project level, because I mean, I can just take a rainbow model. And there are some small modifications, but I can put it into one of these docker systems. But in order to have something that really works for PROJECT2, we would probably have to put a bit more thought into it to get the interface is right, and so on. So just whats. I mean, I could probably get this running fairly quickly. I mean, there is the complication around the. Is that the best way to proceed just to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Toss something over to PERSON5. And then he works on it? Or is it is bettter to have.",
            "No.",
            "A little bit more thought into the project.",
            "Yeah, exactly. We need the thought, we need the discussion on this. So I suggest that for this topic, we plan a mid-January, call with PERSON5 and you and PERSON9. So, yeah, so, and we'll discuss what is the status. So PERSON5 is still in very early stage.",
            "Yeah. Especially in learning all the complications that are like part of, PROJECT2 pipelines.",
            "Right.",
            "And so, for example, he was, kind of surprised by the multi-source and multi-target systems that we are. And the architecture, has to be flexible to allow these, but not too flexible. So that we are not, reimplementing Bash again. So.",
            "Yeah. Right.",
            "Yeah. So lets plan mid January call. Technical call for this.",
            "Okay, Okay.",
            "Right.",
            "Yeah, I mean, it's, it's not just about taking the heat off us, so we don't have to run. Servers. It's about trying to make the whole. Because I see, I've seen what happens it the live testing, and it's.",
            "It is often a bit of scrambling around to get things working and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We could probably do something that's more robust and scalable.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, who all should be involved there?, PERSON5, PERSON2, PERSON4, then PERSON18 probably, right?",
            "I was gonna ask, does this involve PERSON10?",
            "Yes.",
            "I think, I think have to, I'm afraid. Anyway, I'd it'd involve anybody who supplies models.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Right.",
            "I.",
            "And then obviously PERSON15, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "And that should be, that probably should be it. So possibly we, we would. We could also benefit from PERSON5 because there is also the online text flow, the paragraph view that also, we need to be dockerized?, Because it would be safer for, like, that. There was the problem with. In two concurrence sessions, we had two concurrent events, and, we needed to provide two views for these different events. So if the online text flow is also dockerized, then. Similarly, the subtitle view by, by ORGANIZATION4, yeah.",
            "I think. I mean, its not just about dockerization. I mean, what. Where are we running things at the moment? Are they. Are they running in just whatever they can run, or?",
            "Yes, yes, it's a it's a mess, so,",
            "Yeah, I mean, but if we are to run them in the cloud. Is that in any way feasible? Because that would mean we'd have to s. That'd have. We have spend money in cloud computing to do that.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "That may not be feasible.",
            "Especially since the, the new transformer models that we are running do tend to need reviews so that would increase the price.",
            "Yeah, does increase the cost.",
            "I mean, transformers, well. I mean, PERSON2, you're in PROJECT1 everything can run on CPU.",
            "Yeah,",
            "It would a bit of effort,",
            "To enter an ASR models, I think, will not run in time on CPU, I think, on GPU slots.",
            "Shall we ask that?",
            "Yeah, what.",
            "That'd require.",
            "That'd. That would require, number inputs to PROJECT3.",
            "Yeah, it would require sr, significant effort, I would, imagine.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I mean, from what I understand, roughly speaking, for MT. You know, if you are doing single sentence translation, you can, with a bit of optimization, you can run as fast on CPU.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As you can run a GPU. You can get comparable speeds. I suppose the rainbow works by batching. So I think if you're if you are able to do that kind of parallelism, the GPU will win.",
            "That's my guess as well, but, We are not an optimization project, unlike PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, I think that we will. We should take the easiest route here.",
            "Yeah, yeah... yeah.",
            "And the easiest route would be, to have servers hardware on our premises within the consortium that can, run docker, Dockerized packages and use our own GPU. So the, the dockerization would be, for the ease of our management.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Primarily and less so for the deployment at, at some, like, paid hardware. And, I think that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We, we should really test it primarily on our hardware that we have already. And maybe if we feel, then, like, in March, for example, before the April, session, or, in the summer, before the Metaforum. We could test the dockerized systems on paid hardware as a fallback solution for hardware issues.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But lets not. I don't see it as a priority for, for the project.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The management, the dockerization, that is - that is important, but not the deployment on the. On the paid, paid by our hardware.",
            "Yeah, I think deployment and GPU is. Sorry, a client GPU. Can be economical if we just. If it's done. If putting a lot of data through. You know, if you have to leave an idle on GPU, that's that's just going to chop money for, for no benefit. But if its matter, you can spin it up for an hour and then drop it down again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's sort of.",
            "Yes, yes exactly. So, like on this.",
            "But spot... spot... it's not spot. Instances that something else, but, Instances used on spot for, for s individual sessions. That's. That's the level.",
            "Yeah, and our model is based on where. Where either translating a meeting, or we're not translating, and nothing.",
            "Yes.",
            "You know, it's not just like somebody comes along one day, must translate something, and then.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So we don't have to leave things running.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Er, I mean, the.",
            "So, the, the complexity actually lies in a different thing for PERSON7, and that's something that he is aware from. Of. From the very beginning. There is some pipeline which involves some source languages, some target languages, some set up of what has been done by both models. And for this pipeline, three things, Three thing are needed. You need to evaluate it, regularly, so that these components are, are good in quality. So that is this like run for the PROJECT2 test set evaluation. You need to run it on local set up on the existing instances of mediator, existing workers, some of these parts are run immediately, so that's like the, on premises deployment. Within the consorcium. And what we would like to have is to wrap this into a docker file, so that we can ship it to, and create a new, fresh instance on any hardware easily for this, like, spot session coverage. And with these three goals, if. If PERSON7 is successful, then we. I think we'll have everything covered. So regularly, we'll be testing the given pipeline and running it on our systems. And as a fallback solution, we will pay a. A fallback for the hardware, like failures, or whatever. Or for the concurrent sessions, we will deploy the dockers on some paid servers, and that's, that's probably it 49: 39.",
            "Or or for scaling, yeah. I mean, its.",
            "For scaling, yeah.",
            "And you know, it can happen here that we can't. You know, we had the problem last week. There wasn't. Mostly GPUs are taken, you had to hunt round for free GPUs.",
            "Yeah. Then, it's easier to buy them.",
            "Yeah, and we have, we have another cluster we can use, but I think we can't run it there because the workers are not networked.",
            "Yeah.",
            "World, so. I think, yeah, yeah, so. So yes, the, being able to run in the cloud scalability which is.",
            "So, we'll. So I'll ask PERSON7 to do a Doodle poll about this.",
            "And, and we will discuss, yeah. Primarily the technical, technic way. So, if anybody would like to be listed here, then please enter yourself, OK? 50: 34. And PERSON4 have one more point.",
            "Oh yeah. Another thing we were talking about on Monday, and we were. This is more of a research angle, but we were just talking about simultaneous SLT and how it could be made better. And the problem about evaluation of simultaneous SLT. And I'm just curious to see if something we should be addressing at the project. In the sense that, I mean, suppose you're. You've got German audio coming in, and you are producing English, and you are producing in some incremental way. Now, that is a problem, obviously, because the German has different word order, but you may be up to, and OK. So we say, English is fix word order, but it is not completely fixed. There is sometimes, there is reorderings of English, which are okay, but they are perfectly fine. And there are reorderings of English, which are not that good, but they're. They're quite understandable. If. If we are always testing with, basically, I mean, a lot of the tests we have are essentially text to text translation. So, the translator sees the whole sentence and then translates and produces the translation. So our system may be doing something which is quite reasonable, a reasonable way of doing lower latency translation.",
            "But it would get completely penalized in terms of fluid, because it's. It's doing some reordering of the English, of the output language. So, which is fine, and it's prod. It's doing. Doing good low latency translation. But then it would get heavily penalized.52: 01. So, we, so. I would. I saw that in a paper but the MNLP. They did some work on simultaneous SLT, and they said: Oh, we just got some, some interpreters to write 200 sent. 200 translations of our test set, which were done in a more monotonic fashion or something like that. I can't remember how they actually. What instructions they gave. But of course, we don't have this test set. We. I mean, we briefly. And we try and produce something sort of automatically or semi-automatically for this. But we're not really sure. I just want to throw that out there. I don't know if we. If anybody else has thought about this problem.",
            "So my hope here is for the s. Europe. ORGANIZATION1 speech interpretation corpus, Esic, that PERSON12 is compiling, where we have the interpreters output. These are, by, by their nature, some shortened a bit, and they are also as monotonic as the interpreters could do live.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's different from like writing this, but that should be a very large dataset, like compared to a test set that was prepared for the. People.",
            "Yeah,",
            "So, yeah. I think that at this point, there is nothing we can really do, except wait for Dominik to have this ready. And he is making good progress with that.",
            "So the that. There is ten hours manually revised. Between, English, and Czech and German.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So there is. Yeah, that there is going to be, data available quite soon. And then, the research question, like, what do we do with our models to be better at this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I leave this up to the, like, research partners in the consortium. And the only thing that comes to my mind is again. We were asked to collaborate more.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, so perhaps we should try to plan a paper with a particle experiment, either the. The weight K versus whatever the by-dual people did as well. So they. These minimum translation units, we can compare the minimum translation that by-dual approximated with the minimal translation units that we observe from the interpreters in PERSON12's corpus. So there are a number of things that we can, we can try.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I mean, that, actually, that was. That was the question that occurred on Monday. Is PERSON12 corpus going to be suitable for this,",
            "Yes, I think,",
            "And it sounds like it's. Because essentially, that. So the ORGANIZATION1 had tramped, no, they have audio of the original speaker and the interpreter.",
            "Yes, they have both audios.",
            "Is that right?",
            "They have both audios. And.",
            "And do transcripts, or not.",
            "They have also the transcripts for the main speaker,",
            "But not the transcript for the interpreters.",
            "Okay.",
            "But they do have text translation of the, of the English transcript.",
            "Right, but that's not. Oh, yeah, yeah. But that's not a transcript of the interpreter.",
            "Yeah, but we have ASR outputs for the interpreters. And for the ten hours, people are revising this.",
            "Yeah, so, I mean, that seems, yeah, that seems a better way to go, because, arguably, what our simultaneous, automatic simultaneous translation system should be doing, is trying to mimic.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What the interpreter is doing. Rather than trying to mimic what the text translator is doing.",
            "It would be an interesting, interesting thing to do with. We have the text translation of the verbatim transcript, and real transcript of the interpreter. You could use that to actually train some kind of data augmentation system to augment normal text translation corpora to sound like, like the interpreter.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Now, that's a good idea, yeah.",
            "That is another experiment that we should do, yeah. And another, like, option for collaboration. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and separately, I've asked, PERSON13 about the ASR collaboration. So I see a number of things that we really should try together. I just do not know how. How to make sure that this happens.",
            "Yeah. I like the idea about the,",
            "Yeah.",
            "So perhaps, like, PERSON12, do you. Do you think that. What, what should we do, so that PERSON12, you get in sufficient touch with PERSON18 and that you are like sq. Together, you squash the data and do the experiment with this. This data augmentation, the shortening based on the interpreters outputs.56: 49. And and PERSON18, what can we do so that we make this shortening happen? And similarly, PERSON4, what should we do so that we really do the experiment with the different, improvements of the. Of MT for the purposes of online translation.",
            "Okay, so we could do a good comparison based on this data set. Because most of the. You know, I've been reading a few of these papers on simultaneous SLT. And they always just use figures like WMT test sets, and so on. And they just really.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "It is not that. It does not make that much sense. It's probably being rather harsh on the methods. So, yeah, I think we can easily run. You know, we have these, these translations, we can easily run some kind of comparison on them.",
            "Yeah, but the problem that I see is only the management of that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think the solution could be that we agree on a weekly call on this topic. So one weekly call between PERSON18 and PERSON12 on the abridging thing. And another support call, like a sub team, for, the online translation with, with PERSON4.",
            "Or we could also like merged this as a single call.",
            "Should we. It seems like, yeah, you are just slicing. Yeah, I thought I understood that PERSON18 was not talking about abridging, or he may have been, but it was more about, like, sort of, data, yeah, data augmentation. Where you create this sort of monotonized.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, yes, but.",
            "Yeah,",
            "Yeah, but that will also be abridged to a certain extent, I suppose, because.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah,",
            "Tend to produce order.",
            "Okay, so, lets make it, lets make it a New Years resolution,",
            "We'll, we'll find a slot, and from the first week of January, we'll be meeting, at least like PERSON18, PERSON4, me and PERSON12 and possibly others. So that we create, like, a subteam within the project. It's. We are now all slowly getting used to remote working, so it w. It should be feasible for us to do this. And we'll figure out which experiments to run for which conferences. And if we if we really manage, if we, make, if we succeed in our New Years resolution. Then we will be most happy because that's exactly what they are, thy are asking for. Join papers, from researchers paper.",
            "Hopefully, we can move some things forward, as well as, making happy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That's my motivation, really.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So, I'll make a separate Doodle poll, which will be, for finding a regular slot in the. Week, and that means that mostly, you would be available on that slot. We already have such a Doodle poll. So it would be a Doodle poll for a whole week of January, with many hours, but please indicate not for that particular day, but rather your general availability, at that slot and then we'll plan these regular calls,",
            "Okay, I think I understand that, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, right.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's, so, PERSON2 will set up a doodle poll. We will start regular weekly calls, for this, hopefully, we will get to do experiments, and, write papers, yeah. So, it will be, like a subteam, yeah. Cross-partner team will include at least, PERSON4, PERSON18, PERSON12, PERSON2. Right. PERSON12, is there something you wanted to say?",
            "Yes. I am going to compile first betaversion of the corpus and pass it to PERSON16. So I can pass it to PERSON4 and PERSON18 too.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I'm going to do it today.",
            "Okay, great, yeah.",
            "And then you can give me feedback, what to do otherwise, whether to expand the size of the corpus, and so on.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, great. So, that's it,",
            "So I got. I got answers from PERSON11 and PERSON6. So just for the evaluation thing, we have a complete five to five pipeline, including ASR. So we have as ASR for German, English, French, Spanish and Italian. And all the. All MT directions within that. They are. They're ready, they are maybe not running right now, but they can be started if you want them.",
            "Okay.",
            "And in addition, we have, a strong MT model 1: 02: 24. So, transformer to MT models from English to Portuguese, Dutch, Croatian, Slovenian, Polish and Turkish.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "So that's what's available right now.",
            "This is. This is important. I'll get in touch. I'm, I'm sorry. I'll have to relieve myself in a second now. But I'll get in touch with PERSON16. Or PERSON9, maybe PERSON9, could you, Could you summarize this for PERSON16? To, like, update him? Because we had the call before, er, this one. And there is a lot of updates that now, PERSON16 should consider. Like, to use the. Yeah. Should I do it, or could you do that? That's the question, how busy you are.",
            "I think it may be better if you do that. If you have time.",
            "Okay I'll do. Okay.",
            "Thanks.",
            "Yeah. So, I think that sounds very promising. I'm happily, definitely, happily thinking of the ASR, milestone, then.",
            "I think that's fair.",
            "Yeah, perfect. So, thank you very much. And with this positive mood, let me wish you all the best for the Christmas, and also everything best for the, for the whole upcoming year. And we'll be in touch for all the outstanding delibls, but that. We'll manage. OTHER PERSONS Okay, okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Holiday. Break, everyone. Yeah. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye."

            "Hi, yes, we can hear you.",
            "Yea, that's good. So I'm curious if PERSON8 is here. We don't have PERSON8. Okay, that's too bad. But we have PERSON2 that's good and we have PERSON11, PERSON6, PERSON9 and also PERSON19. Yeah. So I would like to hear primarily from the people that I haven't really talked to for a while so that's PERSON19 and PERSON6 and then the rest of you. So PERSON19, if you could start.",
            "So, basically I'm a bit a bit stuck with those experiments, because I had multiple problems with how to run it at all, with explainable mistakes, but finally I managed to run.",
            "And currently I am astarting running those experiments that PERSON11 told me a while ago.",
            "So, what are?",
            "To run the same setup PERSON11 ran for that ORGANIZATION7 card on other cards.",
            "Okay. And it's multi-source or is it only the baselines?",
            "It is only the baselines.",
            "Yeah, it is it is to complete the GPU test and to know that one versi one new version of PROJECT2 really works and it trains on floating point -",
            "F P sixteen.",
            "So after we done this then we will know which version of PROJECT2 we will further use.",
            "Yea, okay, so you are doing it in F P sixteen, in the half precision, right?",
            "Yes yes.",
            "Okay. Run on ORGANIZATION7 GPUs for comparison. Okay, so that's good that you're finally starting I'm a little worried about the multi-source status for the PROJECT4, so is there any chance that we will have - So so what - PERSON19, have you configured it to the PROJECT4 in any way? And this is also a question on PERSON11. Like ou in the PROJECT4 what is missing there, what is really outstanding, what are the problems that we have not like -",
            "I'm waiting for the input from the from ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he promised it by Thursday.",
            "And then I only need to finish the executive summary and -",
            "And maybe one comment from you on PERSON3's paper and then -",
            "And overall, does it look reasonable, or are we - do we have a problem with not enough problem in multi-source?",
            "I hope it's reasonable.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "I explained that we don't have much progress with multi-source, because we first need the data.",
            "The interpretation corpus.",
            "Yes, okay, that's good. So, you are moving into the re to the spoken multi source, like explicitly.",
            "Yes.",
            "We could have done the multi-source research also in the text domain ant that would that was also like of interest. And actually the mul. Yes, so that's - One of the reviewers in the review also asked whether we are combining the document level aspect with the multi-lingual aspect. And I answered that yes, there is like nothing against that and the all the corpora that we're collecting are document level if we - if can have them like that. And they are as multi-lingual as they are. So, still it would be useful to replicate - to redo the multi-source experiments on some larger text text-only data. So, that's something that PERSON19 really should work on after this baseline. So, do we have a corpus like that? So, who all has played with multi-source text-based data? It was PERSON1, as far as I remember. You, PERSON11, played with the window approach, but you never got to multi-source, yet, right?",
            "And the it was the experiment by PERSON10, which are covered there, but they are like small data only and only.",
            "We can use the text from ORGANIZATION8.",
            "So, that's the transcript.",
            "Yes. And translations.",
            "Yeah. So, I really think that some experiments multi-source text in ORGANIZATION8 should be done immediately after, or actually concurrently with what PERSON19 is doing at the moment, right?",
            "But I've - I suppose that text multi-source is not a challenge, because the text are all already very disambiguate so that only one source will be better than two sources. So that's my assumption.",
            "So so sorry, what are you're saying that there is no gain to be expected from multi-source, right?",
            "Yes. On texts.",
            "Does not really expect any gains from multi-source. Okay, we'll see. We should really test this. I agree that with the long-written sentences it is possible that you are right and that the spoken language is more ambiguous and therefore the multi-source is more likely to help. But we don't have numbers for that. This should be tested empirically. So so, PERSON19, I'm think we ned to have a separate call with you and PERSON11 and when could that happen? So that we like double check the exact plans and look under your fingers so to say what you are working on at the at this moment and what else you could start for experiment with the multi.source. So, when you two would be available for a separate call? Which whatever - Tomorrow, or at - would tomorrow afternoon work for you? PERSON19 and PERSON11?",
            "Yes.",
            "At at what time tomorrow?",
            "Just say something, so whatever, two PM or three PM?",
            "Yes it works for me.",
            "Three thirty?",
            "Yeah yeah it's still fine for me.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Yeah. And for PERSON11, it's okay, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah so, great I'll send the link later but I'll definitely plan it to the ORGANIZATION4 calendar for you. That's great. Okay, thanks and in the meantime we got PERSON8. So, it's the now it's the good point to mention the two biggest things and the one of the biggest thing is that PERSON9 is leaving, which is listed at the end of the at the end of the of the notes for today's call. So, PERSON9 is already hopefully with everybody who is getting some of the PERSON9's original tasks. So, PERSON9 himself will finish the language model checking of ASR outputs. That is text-only check if th words kind of make sense, so that we would have a monitor live monitoring of whether the ASR is producing something sensible or whether something is terribly wrong, such as wring language chosen for the wrong channel. And once this is finished by PERSON9 it should be integrated somehow. The integration it will probably already be more on PERSON5 and PERSON8. And with PERSON5 and PERSON8, PERSON9 will synchronize about the tools that PERSON9 has developed and that PERSON5 should incorporate and PERSON8 should regularly use, right? So, have you already agreed on some date for this? I've seen PERSON5 here and he disappeared at the moment. So, PERSON8.",
            "Not exactly, but I'll probably be in touch with PERSON9 o sometimes early next week, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That would be somewhere on the Tuesday or Wednesday.",
            "Yes, so the sooner the better, because like he will be leaving and yeah - Things will only get harder. So actually I was confused the PERSON4 here on the call is not PERSON9, right? It's the other one.",
            "No no, it's the other one, no -",
            "The other one, yeah okay, yeah. So, I was confused because PERSON9 said that he could be late for the call and that's probably happening. So, please be in touch PERSON9 then f. The other PERSON4, who is on the call, can you hear us, PERSON4? So, I'm not sure if the ca.",
            "Yea yea.",
            "Okay, that's good, yeah. So, I've have started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you have reminded PERSON8 that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated. And I think this is also an important message for PERSON5, who has disappeared again from the call. So the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated and everybody should do so. And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself. So, I call it like self or do it yourself integration. So so, PERSON8, when working with PERSON5 and when like documenting what the setups are make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as PERSON4 or then even PERSON9 for the language model checks and everybody else. So, whenever someone develops a new useful component the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself. So this do it yourself integration is important, because otherwise it like it will all remain on you, PERSON8, and you don't want to be overloaded. So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which it has been already done. PERSON4, right? The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs? I think it was.",
            "Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think.",
            "Yeah. So, now it's the time to test it on the live pipelines. And again, I think it's better if PERSON8 explains to PERSON4 how to do it, so that PERSON4 runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic files s like using PROJECT8 or whatever. Simply play them. Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works. Because only when doing the real setup, the true errors wer will appear. Like it is important to first debug it using the log files and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline. And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here in this case PERSON4, it would be most efficient for all us. So so, PERSON8, please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.",
            "Yeah, I do. Also, well I have a call with PERSON4 later today so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We will discuss the exact logistics of that.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "But PERSON4 couldn ’ t install the local copy on laptop because of the restrictions, but I think we have a getaround to that. He can simply download the files on the e ORGANIZATION2 machines.",
            "And then, using PROJECT3 or something else, he can download the files to his local machine.",
            "Or he can also use PROJECT10. So, he also there has a chance to use PROJECT10.",
            "Yeah yeah, that's also. But since his bandwidth is very limited, so -",
            "He prefers to download things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Yeah. Yeah, do whatever works for you. I know it's it's complicated. Okay. So, speaking of the profanity filtering and especially the spasm detection and removal, we have seen during the last sessions that the new ASR the ASR E to E ASR also suffers from this spasm issues. So, the profanity filtering should really be employed twice on each path. First after the ASR and second after the MT.",
            "Okay. Yeah, but spasm coming in, lets say one language stream only, or -",
            "Already in the ASR language, already the English contains suddenly something like O and there were full stops after every O. So, it was actually for a second - PERSON11 saw that, I think. For a second the incoming sentences were like flooded with a lots of O and then they disappeared again.",
            "Ou yes. So, I don't think we need two full profanity spasm removal, because if we remove the one from the ASR itself -",
            "Nothing is getting past to that MT worker, so -",
            "Yeah, but the MT worker can create its own spasm for a good ASR.",
            "Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's also -",
            "Yeah. I think two are needed. Okay so, that was - that was the self the or to do it yourself integration and s yeah, you are - So, PERSON8, you have the call with PERSON9 later today. So that would be the dashboard and the monitor. And hopefully PERSON5 will be there as well. So are you also in touch with PERSON5?",
            "After this call.",
            "Yeah please. Yeah, please join - yeah he disappeared. So so, please make him join to that. Then another thing that PERSON9 is PERSON9 is passing over to others is the PROJECT5 Czech ASR. And PERSON14, will get this from him, so that we have - so that PERSON14 has Kal PROJECT5 baseline for his own experiments, right? Is that correct?",
            "Yes yes.",
            "Okay. And sh and the domain adaptation, so the daily - so the regular preparations for every session that will unfortunately land on PERSON8 only. So, PERSON8, this is another thing that you need to discuss with PERSON9. Maybe that is the main subject of your call today, right?",
            "Oh, I haven't planned a call with PERSON9. I had a planned call with PERSON4, but -",
            "Okay.",
            "Profanity filtering.",
            "Okay okay, so I'm I'm confusing the PERSON4s even now. Okay. But anyway, this domain adaptation, that will land on you. So, when you have a t call with PERSON9, then PERSON9 has already started preparing for the upcoming Monday seminar. That's going to be given by a Italian guy, famous one, the author of PROJECT6 actually. So, if you're curious about that, it's it's o interesting to see it. He will be talking about verb frames. And we should again get ready for that with some domain adaptation. So, PERSON9 has probably started, but he should walk you through that thing, so that you can do it yourself next time. And it should be as automated as possible. Yeah. And the last bit is the multi-accent English. So the English which is robust to the various speakers. So, on Monday we will hear the Italian English. And yesterday we had a chance to hear the Japanese English and the ASR was really struggling with that, so that's - Yeah, we really need that. But this is mainly on PERSON14. Yeah. So, - That was -",
            "Can I alter English one?",
            "Yes.",
            "Because I like the idea. And I mean I'd really like to see how it plays out.",
            "Yeah yeah, sure. So, just make sure to be in touch with PERSON14. So, PERSON14, please include PERSON8 in this part as well. So, whenever you have a like whatever tasks that PERSON8 can help with, then work on that jointly. So, for that I think that PERSON14 is now mentioning in his report here the recording segmentation. Is that the thing that you are the - Is it really - So, what do you mean by recording segmentation? That's the short question, PERSON14.",
            "I mean the cutting the recordings to words.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then getting it together to create a new recordings with different sentences.",
            "Yeah yeah, so, for the multi accent English. So, we are now with PERSON14 putting that together to just one technical solution. The current idea that PERSON14 is working on is that he will create new sentences by words that were spoken in other sentences and he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. So that's, that's one particle experiment. And later on, we, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing. So, this - these new sentences will - it will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we are going to create new sentences by from text-only language model by adding the sound part to that. So that's - the language model will be better by that for the ASR and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. Yeah. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was like during the training. They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So, they were training on disrupted inputs and that also greatly improved the robusteness of the system. So -",
            "If I'm - I'm I'm not sure how they apply it, but I think that the pipeline, the training by applying a, which is used for training of the uses this same technique.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's already -",
            "It's already there. Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so that's - This is very important to know which all bells and whistles are available in which toolkit, so yeah, maybe it's there. Okay. So that is - that was the like news and work that is being put on you because PERSON9 will be leaving. And another like a long term, or as well as a short-term pile of work has arrived because of the two sessions that we had. So, I would really like to ask everybody to record the experience from the PROJECT1 and S G one sessions and also - Well, PERSON5 is not here - Also the - there is one more lesson that we have like harshly learned yesterday when PERSON8 was still in hospital waiting for the Covid test or something like that and the pipeline had to be started by PERSON9 and PERSON5 and unfortunately they failed. So so, we still are totally relying on one person who is able to start the pipeline and that is a bad situation. So, PERSON8 this is this is mainly on you and also on PERSON16 and PERSON5 to like make sure that the whole setup is understandable and regularly tested by others in the team and the do-it-yourself integration would help with that, actually. So, the system needs users and the more diverse users, the more different users, the better, because it will be robust to the different conditions of the users. And th yesterday PERSON5 knew in principle what to do. He managed to get the ASR running and presented, but the rainbow worker was stuck for a while, then it was restarted by PERSON15 in Edinburgh. And then it - we were not able, or PERSON5 was not able to properly use it. So, the languages were swapped there and some of the languages didn't contain any reasonable output, just some language codes instead of the output. So, it's too fragile in that respect and PERSON8 and PERSON16 please be in touch with PERSON5 and propose some solution, so that we are much more robust even to like individual persons not being available, right?",
            "Yeah yeah. So, actually I had a call yesterday I mean while I saw PERSON5's email regarding the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Errors that he got pipeline. An i kind of had a talk with - a call with him right at the moment when I was reached. And actually I saw that he was trying to run a worker which was not running in the mediator.",
            "So that was kind of creating errors.",
            "Yeah so, obviously didn't know enough about the architecture -",
            "Yeah, exactly. Yeah.",
            "He he didn't know where to look and what to check so - Yeah. So, this is something that it should be like more self-explanatory and, well, better documented, so that people would be able to get it running. So, PERSON16, you were during that time you were in some different lecture, or - Because at some point I suddenly saw that PERSON5 stopped trying maybe, or maybe he was trying but without any success. I don't know.",
            "No, actually around - I would say around like two pm we were having a call and I was explaining him through the pipeline through that script like what does each block - what e exactly it does and how to debug. So, I explained it now you are you are getting this error, so how to debug, what section is exactly issue at.",
            "So, first try with the ASR. Then try with the itself. Try individual ASR and MT worker and things like that. He he was able to understand -",
            "Debug them, but yeah - Because it would not be surprise if PERSON5 failed, because he was trying for the first time.",
            "Okay.",
            "And yeah, the pipeline is pretty complicated for someone who has seen it for the first time to -",
            "Yeah, but I was surprised that like the pipeline - because it was the same pipeline that the pipeline -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Couldn't be simply reused.",
            "But why did the fingerprints then change?",
            "No, the fingerprint was still the same, but the worker was not running.",
            "But when the workers started running it didn't work. That that's something which I don't understand.",
            "Maybe it's because of PERSON16 - Have you changed the common addresses file to include PERSON6's worker?",
            "No, we have a separate directory for that.",
            "Yeah so,",
            "< unintelligible. This is kind of again you know a bad thing that if you want to implement PERSON6's worker we need to have a separate script - This is kind of bad.",
            "This is very bad, yes. Exactly, this is this is very bad. So, it - so please you three, make a call, a pre like set up a call with PERSON5. It's a pity that he is not here at the moment. And discuss how this should be done. Because PERSON5 is now - After his experience, he is working on like how to make how to make the configuration cleaner. So, please discuss this with him very carefully. So, next week I would like to hear from you three how far you got in the in the like specifications of the requirements so to say. So. So, I'll put it here. PERSON17 asks PERSON5, PERSON16 and PERSON8 to have a call and provide the first specification of requirements for pipeline set ups, so that it is much less error-prone and more modular. Easy. E G easy to integrate also the profanity filtering, PERSON6's rainbow worker and so on.",
            "PERSON6 I'd also like to request you, so you have multiple scripts that it start the that it starts your NMT workers, which is like. So, this is kind of confusing for -",
            "Okay.",
            "I personally know each of these scripts, but the new people did not know. So maybe if you could remove these scripts which have the similar performance or only leave that which is usable and which is kind of okay for the okay for our live sessions.",
            "Can we maybe - I can maybe make it so that there is one script -",
            "Because -",
            "With some different parameters.",
            "Yeah, with different parameters because basically before this structure was like for the - actually workers for the English to Czech model.",
            "Which also uses tensor to tensor, so it uses the same structure, but - Yeah so, maybe I could add some parameters, for example, to limit the number of languages.",
            "Exactly.",
            "And also to - yeah further. Some switch for the for the which model to use, but it impossible to pass these parameters to Q sub when you when you run it on cluster.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Suppose like, if you have one worker, which emits all the languages. I mean, it's up to us, we can control how many languages we want to see in the subtitling platform. It's completely up to us. But if you think that when starting the worker, if you limit the parameters, if you limit the number of languages there itself and if you think that it improves the maybe, I don't know, maybe speed. So, then I think we should go for that.",
            "Yeah so, that's a good question on PERSON6. PERSON6 -",
            "Is is it better to run the multi-lingual model with fewer languages enabled? I don't think it is any saving.",
            "Well, we did it actually, when we were testing it. I think we did it with PERSON11, if I'm not mistaken, when we were testing, or with PERSON16, when we were testing it on - I do not remember where it was.",
            "It was the - it was the. It wasn't - It wasn't a hackathon, yeah.",
            "Yeah yeah, exactly. And PERSON4 -",
            "So -",
            "Kind of perfomance stable constructed with the PERSON15's rainbow worker and PERSON6's rainbow worker and comparatively, PERSON15's rainbow worker were a better were a better side.",
            "So also -",
            "And in terms of speed, PERSON15's rainbow worker was better in speed, but was it better in scores?",
            "Not the speed, I mean overall. It's scores was were better for PERSON15's worker.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, then there is actually no point in having PERSON6's rainbow worker in the pipeline at the moment, right?",
            "But but -",
            "Yeah, I think - yeah.",
            "If - well, for a fallback solution it's important like remember during the. We we did -",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We need to have it like -",
            "Yeah, but still basically - Yeah yeah, there are still basically like two thinks that are bad with the model. One thing is that it wasn't trained with the fine tunings that PERSON15 used, such as using partial sentences and other stuff.",
            "And the and the other problem is that it was basically trained using tensor to tensor, which makes it very, very slow. So that's why we use the subset of the languages, because then like then it could work real time, but otherwise that there was quite a big delay, like two seconds to translate something.",
            "Maybe this is a stupid idea, but what I think is that if we could have like a multiple work multiple, I mean, multiple replicas of your same worker and each emitting a different each having a different subset of languages.",
            "Yes, that could be a s fallback solution.",
            "But the main question is, how come that it's slower with more languages like I don't see that, because it should be paralyzing when your -",
            "Yeah so yeah so, there are maybe like forty languages. So there are forty, like the big size is forty.",
            "Yes.",
            "And and for big size forty it is actually a lot slower than for big size eight, for example.",
            "Oh. Okay, so that is - that is strange. This is something that I would not have expected, because it should be running in parallel, right?",
            "Yeah it is somehow PROJECT2 is better optimised so -",
            "So so maybe like for a for a better solution, I would probably -",
            "Yeah so I think that as a fallback solution -",
            "Use PROJECT2, yeah.",
            "Yeah yeah. So, I suggest that we do not use PERSON6 tensor to tensor worker at all for the live sessions. It is good, maybe, for creating the synthetic data or whatever. But we sh. As the fallback solution we should have the PROJECT2 models running as a worker on our side. So, we should be able to launch rainbow worker from PERSON15 on our cluster. So -",
            "Yeah, for that I think I located the directory on -",
            "Well, we have the code for that. I think PERSON16 had copied from PERSON15 -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I got the directory for it and I'll start looking into it.",
            "So sorry, I missed that. So are you going to do that, right, PERSON8, correct?",
            "Yes, yeah, I'm going to look into it. PERSON16 mentioned that he when he tried, he had failed because of some errors that he does that recall right now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'll see what errors are those, and -",
            "Get in touch get in touch with PERSON19 and others. So, actually all of you, I suggest that all of you are at the devel at ORGANIZATION2 mailing list. And let's use this mailing list for these technical issues, like getting PROJECT2 running. I know that it will it will flood the list also for others who are working other things, but this is so like low level issues, that it's worth having this discussion in the devel at ORGANIZATION2 mailing list. So -",
            "And also -",
            "Yeah?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Are you all in the list?",
            "Yeah o.",
            "I'm not sure if I am. I don't think I am.",
            "I think that I'm not either, but also, I am I am using the newest version of PROJECT2 actually to train the shortening models. So, I have version one point nine compiled as well. And -",
            "So the devel is - Or another option is to use - So, the devel is really - I see it's old people there. We have people like PERSON5 there, but we don't have - So, we could also use the PROJECT9 ORGANIZATION2 list for that.",
            "And what's your issue with PROJECT2? Can you repeat it?",
            "So actually, when I was working with PROJECT2 I had several like path conflicts. There were like chain of paths, which needed to be which needed to be fixed, and I was kind of unable to backtrack ea-each of them. Yeah so, I never tried to then.",
            "Do you mean path configs like wrong paths for the PROJECT2 itself, or for them or in the model config.",
            "If you talk about running PERSON15's model, then PERSON15 sent us some scripts with absolute paths on their systems and we just need to replace them with our paths correctly and then hopefully it will work.",
            "Yeah, I can also try this if you send me the location of the models.",
            "Yeah, sure. I'll again find it and send it to you. Oh PERSON16 can do that if he.",
            "Yeah I'll forward you the email later.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I'm thinking, who else who else should be - Yeah.",
            "I think you already have the email, PERSON6.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah -",
            "With the -",
            "The the subject is you adding rainbow models.",
            "Rainbow -",
            "But let me send you again with the path, actually.",
            "Yes yes, because I don't have the path, I think.",
            "Yeah so -",
            "PERSON16, please on that email as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah so, use whatever communication platform works for you. Like direct emailing is fine as well. Remember to that PERSON19 is also a source of information, because PERSON19 will now be fighting with that and he will be running into the same issues and he has successfully fighted with PROJECT2 in the summer, so he also has some pretty fresh experience. So, it's PERSON19. The will autocomplete the email for you. And also. So, if you do not know who could help you with what email PROJECT9 dash ORGANIZATION2. And I've I'm just asking PERSON7 to add PERSON19 there and I'll I'll make sure that you are there. Like all of you, who can possibly answer such questions are there. So, let's let's use elit PROJECT9 dash ORGANIZATION2 also for the technical issues. If you run into random questions, ask around, never wait. That's that's it. Never wait. Okay. So, I would like to hear from PERSON6 a quick report.",
            "Yeah so, right now, I am working on the shortening and extending models. And so I already have the first models, but now I am trying to vary the amount of data and the length in the dataset. And to see like what is the difference in performance and length. And then when I'm happy with this, then I will get to the second phase, where I will basically translate synthe and creating synthetic data from the rest of the PROJECT7 dataset. And then I will build like the final shortening model.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also - Yeah so, here I a I actually run into one issue that basically I'm running out of storage quota on Mala Strana.",
            "Aha. Yeah so, just ask for more. So have an estimate. Ask for more. That's it. So -",
            "You just need to come up with a reasonable estimate how much more you need.",
            "So there they do have space, they only give it away only like after they have seen that the people have thought about it. Because -",
            "Okay.",
            "The practice is that no one ever cleans up after themselves.",
            "So the only way to avoid an exponential growth is to make the growth modest and moderated.",
            "Yeah okay. And also yeah also this is the problem with the organization97's one hundred language models, because they take like fifty gigabytes themselves.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, just.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "A copy, write an estimate how much you need to.",
            "Okay.",
            "It at ORGANIZATION2 and will.",
            "And do you maybe now like how much space there is available on Troja, because maybe I could save something there.",
            "S w as simply say what you need -",
            "Okay okay, I will just -",
            "They will they will -",
            "Okay.",
            "They will know what is better.",
            "Okay.",
            "And actually since the better GPUs are on Troja, having the data in Troja makes more sense.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Okay, that's good.",
            "Or you can use command D F and it will tell you the space on all the discs.",
            "Yeah. Or D F minus H for human re.",
            "Okay, just I don't see the quota there.",
            "There is a command to check the quota.",
            "Write it into the document.",
            "Okay okay, thanks.",
            "So in the - I'll check what is called - Yeah so, alias. So, is it this one? Yeah. So, I use -",
            "Oh, that's a different quota. Okay. Yes, I agree. Yes, that's the that's the command.",
            "So I actually have an alias for this, so I -",
            "Okay, I see it now.",
            "When I type quota I get this - I get the output of this.",
            "Okay, so on Troja I have 50 gigabytes. Yeah, that's -",
            "That's too little. Obviously you can you can ask for much more.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's good. So, is there anyone who should report some progress and we have forgotten about hi.",
            "Yeah, I actually have like one last thing.",
            "And basically PERSON12 would like to have a call.",
            "Oh yeah, okay. Yes.",
            "And and he would like you to be -",
            "Be on that call.",
            "Participating as well.",
            "Yeah, so th what are his constraints and what are your constraints? Tomorrow afternoon before the call that I have with PERSON19 and PERSON11, like tomorrow at two. Would that work?",
            "I think that would work for me, so I can write to him.",
            "So try yeah try that, because I'll have called at half past three with PERSON11 and PERSON19.",
            "Okay.",
            "Also, PERSON17 the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There is a guy here in Saarbrücken. He he's on he's almost completed done with his masters'.",
            "He's an Indian guy and that is his name and he mentioned that he's actually interested to join your group with you.",
            "Maybe maybe as a PhD or as a full-time job.",
            "And he said -",
            "To apply for - To apply for PhD, one deadline is very soon. It's the end of the year.",
            "Okay.",
            "December thirty one. So, he should check - it's something like ORGANIZATION2 slash PhD.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he should email that he's interested to send an email to PhD at ORGANIZATION2 something like that.",
            "Okay okay. I'll let him know. And he also mentioned that - because his masters' thesis is based on neural machine translation and -",
            "He expressed his interest to join your group and he also mentioned that he had a discussion with you, I don't know, about something during.",
            "Yeah, I don't remember so, well -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, I don't know his name. So yeah so for PhD application, he should email that email, PhD at ORGANIZATION2. And I'm beyond my capacity, but others may have the capacity. And for the general connection with PROJECT9, yes that's not dependent on the deadline at all and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that would work. So I'm trying - Okay. So I'm - for tomorrow at two, I'm trying to send the ORGANIZATION4 invite. So, that's probably it and I want - Still we are way beyond our planned time. That's because we haven't had our call last week unfortunately. So, I'm now highlighting the experience from the PROJECT1 and S G one again. I've already reminded everybody to record what you what you saw and also read what other has what other have experienced. But let's also discuss the lessons that we learned and the immediate lessons and the to do list are this. Yes, we absolutely need the evaluation of all systems, all files in the test set. Like in PROJECT9 test set automate. So how far is that? That's a question for PERSON8.",
            "Sorry for that.",
            "Yeah, because of the Covid -",
            "Yeah. They isolated me and I couldn't do anything. Like I told them this is normal for me, but they were pretty insistent on having me and letting me go home.",
            "Oh okay, so you really like caught it in the hospital, right?",
            "I was, yeah. But I was raised like very late in the night around nine, nine thirty Indian time, so -",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So, I have started finishing that today. Hopefully, by the end of the day, I'll be done with it. So, I have a call at two thirty Prague time with PERSON4 to discuss some of the specifics of that is around capability of downloading files. Do I need to do it manually? So, there are some calls to discuss - There's something to discuss PERSON4. And apart from that, the code is almost finished with that discussion. I think I'll be able to wrap it up today itself.",
            "Yeah, and we have done on the call. So, PERSON2 will be the person who will pick this up from you. And. Yeah?",
            "Yes.",
            "So are you also planning, PERSON2, to be on that call with PERSON4 -",
            "Or with PERSON8 after that.",
            "Which one, is it? I'm sorry, I don't remember -",
            "I think I will have a call with PERSON2 later, because that specific all is related to automating the ASR evaluation. Yeah, it's basically to generate ASR automatically. And if I evaluate the ASR given any index file. So, what essentially my script will be doing is taking an input of - Taking the index file as an input and it will generate the ASR from whatever model there is mentioned in the script. And I'm trying to make it as like as we as flexible as possible so that we don't need to hardcode the ASR in the script. We can just choose that this is I want to use. Same goes for the MT models. But yeah, essentially, it's that. So, after that I'll have a call with PERSON2 to discuss all the things that I put in the script and then I think he can take it up from there.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, the idea is that once you evaluate exactly as flexible as you just describe it. Once you evaluate it, the outputs need to be stored somewhere and the scores have to be stored somewhere and PERSON2s know PERSON2 knows where these things should be stored. So next time when you ask for the same thing - Like it could give you the cached output already. I'm saying it could because I think it is better to like have it run again. But - and create one more entry and if the entry is identical, then we're good, we know that nothing has de like worsened. But it - Then, without running anything, you should just be able to look at the stored outputs and the stored scores, and it would immediately see where we are standing. So, this recording of the results is something that PERSON2 will manage.",
            "Okay so, PERSON8, let me know when you finish it and we can arrange a meeting and then I will look at it, and I will write it into the PROJECT4. Yes?",
            "I think I will have - I'll have call with you next week on Monday or Tuesday. So -",
            "Okay okay, that sounds good, okay.",
            "Yeah, great. Okay, so that was the first immediate lesson. And to do that arose from the last week sessions and the other one is the management thing. So, when there is some session happening, we really need to make sure that we have the important people around the globe like available. So, I have halfway asked if PERSON15 would be there, he did not respond and in the end he was not available. And a very similar thing happened also yesterday during the call at three PM Prague time the two UTC call. Again we were like chasing PERSON15 through a on slack. So, it was it was crazy. So for this we need to know which components we are using and who are the people behind these components. And for important sessions we really should secure that we have the people. So, this is like a message for me but also for PERSON8 as a fallback solution if I if I forget to make sure that we have these people available, or that would know that they won't be available. It is also okay. So, if we knew that PERSON15 is unreachable because he is traveling, or whatever that can, of course, happen, but we need to know what to do. We need to know what is our fallback solution if that party is not present. And then we have the long term focus. And I would like - So, the things that I spotted that really need attention are these. And I would like to put your names next to those for yo to know that like you are the people who are long-term including this goal and this challenge in your plans. So, this non-native accent that's very critical. And here the person is PERSON14 and possibly PERSON8 to a little extent, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Hh anyone else anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing proba. Could be - mi well, yeah I don't know. Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document. It is highlighted in four times highlighted. It is called. So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session. And we need to collect it like prepare it manually create it somewhat. And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible. So that is a there is a certain like skill behind that needs to be practiced. So, I'm quite skilled in shuffling text files. And whenever I see you any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head that what could be done faster. Maybe it is not faster for you end, but at least you should consider it. So there this skill is something that we need people to have. And we need someone to be like responsible for that. And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be PERSON8. If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so. And then we need - So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems. So my impression from the domain adaptation that PERSON9 has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR. So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday. PERSON9 is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in the PROJECT5 set up. So, maybe PERSON9 and PERSON8, because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and PERSON14, because he is doing how to work with PROJECT5. If you three could meet and double check what is PROJECT5 doing with the - It's not PROJECT5, actually, the domain adaptation is for the PERSON18 toolkit, right.",
            "Yes, I can -",
            "Yes, it is so.",
            "Yeah. So, if you could like somehow - PROJECT5 will be similar, but we don't have that pipeline for PROJECT5 yet. But if you if you could like dig into the toolkit and debug whether it is actually getting the words into that. So, I know that PERSON9 has already tried that once. Can you confirm that you are a 100 percent sure that the dictionary is well included, and the substitute words are for the language model are really used and it's asking the correct ngrams with the substitute words instead of the new words? Can you confirm that this is really happening?",
            "For domain adaptation?",
            "Yeah, the domain adaptation. I think so be I think so, because we had - So, we were testing it with a non-domain-adapted model -",
            "And the domain-adapted ones and the domain-adapted ones were capturing the domain-adapted words much better than non-domain-adapted ones.",
            "Yeah, so if you have this ex good experience then maybe I'm I'm wrong, but my impression was that it is not really not really visible in the output. So please convince me, ideally with outputs and also numbers that it's it's doing the job.",
            "Okay, but for that, we will probably need the transcript. Like we'll need one of the Monday meetings transcribed.",
            "So the, for example, in PROJECT9 test set there is this Monday talk of mine, the ye the everything can go wrong. That contains a fair bit of terminology.",
            "Yeah, Okay so - But our models - I'm not sure if well we have the domain-adapted model for that or not. But of course, all we can test the latest one on that as well -",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, this is like kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works, the new data well, but then there is also one thing and that is - It's - At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR. So what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure. So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time. End to end ASR, which is better in general. And then domain-adapted PROJECT5 setup, which is used only to spot the keywords. And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would s like use that sentence from PROJECT5, which is in general worse, but contains the right terms. So that's that's my like suggestion what we could do. And and another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that. So we have discussed this with PERSON14. And PERSON14 is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?",
            "Not yet.",
            "Yeah, so if there would be anyone else, who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch. So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet. And that's the most stringent the most urgent problem these days. So, we really could make a an impact there.",
            "Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like ORGANIZATION4's models on ORGANIZATION5 that they are like already pretty good at these things -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and I think that if we just like - We could probably just steal the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos that basically with different domains and different speaker lan speaker native languages on ORGANIZATION5. And and like I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to the download basically these some kinds of filtered videos from ORGANIZATION5 and make training tests a training set out of them.",
            "Yeah, I agree. Except we don't have the human capacity to do that. So, PERSON6's proposal to scrape ORGANIZATION5 and even automatic -",
            "Yeah and it's actually something similar to what basically corpus was, right -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If I'm -",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So maybe we could reuse actually what's what did -",
            "Yes.",
            "There.",
            "Yes, that's true. So, we need we need colleagues for this. So, if you if you ar are in touch with someone such as PERSON14 is in touch with someone, then - Yeah, so this is - It would be - Yeah - It would be great. So -",
            "Yeah, just an idea, but -",
            "So little chance here a little chance PERSON14's friend will help with this, yeah. PERSON8 will evaluate. And then. Yeah, profanity and then the positive speak. So, I have some examples. I've recorded them either in the Monday seminar document or maybe here in the PROJECT1 S G one that the ASR is sometimes - Yeah. So, one session was that a at PROJECT1. There was the debate whether languages are whether African languages will be supported by some of the European project. And the answer from the project coordinator was that, well we were discussing this a lot. and then, unfortunately, it's it ’ s African and we don't have capacity for that. But the word discussing was recognized as disgusting. And the translation was that, like we were disgusted by the idea of including African languages in our project. So even the word disgusting, which is not a bad word on his own is very risky, so we should - Our our profani filtering should really be aggressive about any slightly negative words, right?",
            "Maybe maybe I have a idea here, because I am afraid that we cannot just aggressively remove these words, because there are many words that actually might harm someone, and especially these days, but maybe we c we could employ these neural networks that, I forget how this task is called, but it's like based on the movie review of -",
            "Yeah, sentiment analysis.",
            "Some network. Yeah yeah, sentiment analysis. Well, maybe we can use some sentiment analysis to remove sentences or some group of words with a negative sentiment or something like that or adapt it to some not actually negative sentiment, but rather some aggressive sentiment. If we can retrain this that way in such way.",
            "I have some experience with that -",
            "But it doesn't play well. Because ultimately oh, I mean, that's oh kind of very specific to a use case. So not exactly similar, but when I was working with the financial dataset that we had created oh in my previous work, so we were looking for things from, let us say, an investor's point of view. It was to sentiment analysis. That view is very subjective. So even if you train a neural network model to spot some of the things that might be disrespectful or demeaning to someone or maybe that shouldn't be there, the - including the subjectivity is pretty hard. It's a complete task of its own. So, it takes a lot of work. It will probably take a lot of work and -",
            "Maybe maybe there are already some datasets, because if I remember correctly ther the social media like Facebook or ORGANIZATION1 etcetera they actually use such things to filter the posts, because they are obliged to filter some racist and some bad statuses. So maybe they have created some.",
            "Oh yes, Yes, this is very true. There was actually a competition for this, where people had to make models to detect tweets or like sentences which were harmful in some ways. And basically, if you just download some models from this competition, then you will have a classifier that can classify basically, this sentence is like hateful or like there are like five categories like fake news, hateful and other. I don't know what like what. So definitely you can use this for the task.",
            "Yeah, that's that's good suggestion.",
            "I can send you the link.",
            "Please paste it -",
            "Paste it in the document diretly.",
            "But remember -",
            "The task was one of that.",
            "Yes but remember that our setting is slightly different from these competitions and also the yeah. The the difference is that we do not expect the speakers to use this abusive language, or whatever you call that. So, in our case, what we are after is more like sentiment inconsistency rather than bad sentiment. Because we expect these people to say only the nice thing. It's like official speeches. And the bad words arise only as errors of ASR and errors of translation, and that's a different setting. And I think that with in this different setting, the problem with the subjectivity that PERSON8 mentioned, and I agree that is very important, but it may be less severe. So, I think there - it could work, but it could w. We should probably train it differently to get the most of that.",
            "But also, if we detect something using this model, then we can know that there was a problem in -",
            "Actually -",
            "In translation.",
            "Actually, I think it would make the task much easier, because since we are not expecting anything bad, so anything bad that is there can just be removed. I'm not sure how well it will perform, but yeah, if it seems hateful in general, we can just remove it, because we are not expecting the speaker to say it. So, we know that if it's hateful, it's just bad. So, we are not showing it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So in other words, the ASR should make a different hypothesis that's that would be the only ildi ideal behavior. Like that in your ear, there would be this positive filter. You never you would never ever understand the bad word at all.",
            "Yeah, something like that. I mean, we can just say in the profanity filter part - We can just look out for hateful comments or the ha or hateful sentence, and we can simply remove it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It will be like a sentence was said, but it's not transcribed by ASR. It is actually transcribed. We will have it in our logs, but it won't be displayed on the subtitling platforms.",
            "Yeah. It will be like hidden.",
            "Yeah. So, I see that as a great option for someone who would like to supervise a student so it could be whatever PERSON11 or PERSON14 or - PERSON6, I don't know if you have any stu. No, you don't have any. You're not. You don't have any bachelor students yet, because you are still studying right?",
            "I have some at ORGANIZATION6, who might be interested, but -",
            "Yes yes, that would be easier. We could we could also then employ them easier because they are - They will be czech citizens.",
            "Well, maybe I can ask my student, because we haven't agreed on the bachelor's thesis.",
            "Well well I think he should he should stay with the non-native English accidents.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Find another one.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So so we see and again like a good space for research. And the here the last item that I had on my list was shortening MT, and that's in PERSON6 so - PERSON6, but also. Who was that who was that? The two more people, PERSON13 and then one more person was somehow related to this task of shortening MT. I'll I'll I'll think about that - working on that.",
            "PERSON17, I just wanted to ask one more thing. So, oh for that task, can I ask the students who are already in for their first or second year. If they are interested in doing that then, maybe since they will already be in Prague -",
            "Yes.",
            "It will be equivalent as the other student.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "I'll ask if -",
            "Yeah.",
            "One of them is interested.",
            "For the for the positive speek, for the profanity filtering.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, please do, definitely. That would be useful. Okay well so, thanks a lot for your time. If you pl. I would still like to ask you, please read the experience of others, record your experience from the most recent sessions and also, if you are short of ideas, read the problems in the Monday tests document. And if you spot any other ideas that like could be fruitful. Put them here. Let's lis let's discuss them next week as well. I'm happy to see that actually we have covered by someone to some extent the these topics that I found, but there is probably more and - Yeah, we just need more people to do that. So, with that I would probably end. Is there still anything that we should add discuss today?",
            "I don't have anything else. Okay so, other than like saying that my visa is approved, and I'll probably be in Prague in January.",
            "Yes, so that will be great, if you if you finally make it. You you will be the first one who really makes it to Prague, because people from - others are struggling. So please do arrive. That would be that would be very useful. So, we will have one more this call next week and then it will be already the Christmas Day and then the New Year's Eve, so two weeks of a break from these Thursday calls. And then on the 7th of January we'll meet again. So next week and then in January. PERSON10? Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, thanks very much to all of you for the attendance and for your patinence ehpatience. It was too long today and talk to you individually and also next week. PERSON10? Thank you.",
            "Thank you, bye.",

So that we fit into the half hour. And PERSON7 is hopefully answering. So my to-dos or the items that I want to bring up are the two sessions that we have. So one is PROJEC210 and the other is PROJECT2. So PROJEC210 is the holocaust survivors session. And PROJECT2 has been postponed by a month. So that gives us some extra time, which is which is good.

So, I'm I'm sending a question to PERSON13 now. So the second event, the PROJECT2, that will have two parts. One will online, pre-recorded, and that will be interleaved with real-life discussion, which will take place in the theatre. And I'm going to the theatre tomorrow for like technical meeting. So that I will see where we can plug our ORGANISATION241 and actually record the sound on the on site. And and I'm just checking if PERSON13 would be available as a backup person in case whatever, I get sick or something like that. For - That's in February. It has been moved to the 26th of February. So we need. Yea?",
            "Yes, okay. We can do it.",
            "Yea. Thanks. So so I plan to do it myself. I plan to go there, but like we need a backup person. And also, for the PROJEC210 event we need someone to take care of the recording - So the archiver person so that we don't lose that session again. So this is these two things. And the like more important and still persisting topic to work on is the ladder climbing. And I've suggested here in the in the paragraph for PERSON2 that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that would grow. And yeah, it could show the - So that's - I think that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences as the perfor. As like new systems, will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign. It may be difficult to prepare these tables. So I asked PERSON7 and PERSON7 unfortunately won't be available during this call. To s To tell us whether ORGANISATION242, which is a web based solution. Some start up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free. If that would help us are or not. Yeah yeah, okay, so ORGANISATION242 is not recommended by PERSON7. So so the simple html is probably the way to go. So, as soon as PERSON2 has these evaluations cleaned up. So that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from PROJECT3 test set and some automatic runner. Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similarly to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage. Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html. So that it would be immediately accessible through the web and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and like explore that. So this would be useful, especially for people outside of ORGANISATION2 such as, ORGANISATION15. We know they have like - The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly browse it on the web. They could also browse it actually in on ORGANISATION101. So if yae - This this is up to you to set it up so that it's like user friendly and easy to follow.",
            "Okay, I'll I'll do that.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So that's myself - I'm I'm now working on, or getting to update the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken. And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions. So - Yea there's the standard work. And then I'm pretty busy with minuting like not doing anything myself, but just arranging what people do. So that's my report. So please then proceed one by one and tell me. We have already heard from PERSON5 probably no progress over the Christmas. Yeah, that's that's fine like it's it's exam period, so. So PERSON2, maybe if you could summarize your impressions from the finishing of the. Like what is missing and what is - What you were happy about and what you were unhappy about when doing D one point five and D six point three?",
            "In D one point five - Okay, so we are just reporting - I mean we are reporting the numbers of words. About the transcript. Right. I mean - Yeah it's good metric, I would say, to represent the number. But I would also say that we should also represent a language, because like, let's say, English to German or English to Czech or so that ultimately we get enough - An idea about the conversion, like the word ratio of two languages for a given transcript.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That would also be helpful. And then the third probably also help us in getting. So I guess we if there are some lines, which are coming from ASR and we want to remove it. Or we had to remove the empty line due to profanity filtering.",
            "So we had to check it at the moment that - whether to remove the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm I'm not sure -",
            "So what you -",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah. So let me let me take a record here. So, PERSON2 will do this and then, as observations, some D one point five and D six point three preparation. So, for test set size info we should add status per language pair. Then - For - What the second thing what - Yea yea -",
            "Okay, so the -",
            "For for ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric - Actually more, we should add complementary met these complementary metrics. So you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering evaluation. So have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output, right? And then rare words evaluation. And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output. Scored not simply by order rate but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right? Yes, so I totally agree. This involves also manual preparation of the reference. So, both need manual - manually created references. I have one remark from PERSON1. So PERSON1 has compiled some translation dictionary. And should - she should share it soon. So this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word - So this would be the rare word eval for MT and then from PROJEC210 we are also likely to get some dictionary. So that would be the PROJEC210 domain obviously. And PERSON2, could I ask you to revise the domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs. So like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the domain. Could you do that?",
            "I can. I still have to make a call with PERSON8. So we haven't had a call yet. We'll probably have one call with him next Monday.",
            "And then, yea - I can look at it -",
            "So - Yeah, so you're you're afraid you're busy. You ca probably can't get to it soon.",
            "Actually - No, I mean not before Monday, because tomorrow I have.",
            "Yea, so let's so - Well - Next week consider if PERSON2 would have the capacity to extract - Or we could also ask PERSON3, not PERSON8, but PERSON3 to extract this positive plus negative lists from domain documents. So that would be the various things.",
            "There was one more thing.",
            "So basically, it has to do with the scores that we are calculating.",
            "So, I think we need to improve our segmenter, the worlds are fine. If we improve our segmenter our scores should be higher than.",
            "Okay, so the segmenter - well, is a problem. Yeah. If we improve that - Yeah - Well, it would be much better. Okay, so what I miss still and what should belong to the ladder climbing and the regular reports is SLT style of evaluation. So we will talk about this at the latest next Wednesday with partners. Whether we are happy with the way of delay is being calculated. So, PERSON2, could you get us also some of the delay scores. So, maybe start with a single document do not do it for all of them yet, but get in touch with PERSON3 and get some delay scores for some of the files in PROJECT3 test set. Perhaps from LSSLT dev set. The the Portuguese or whatever domain. So, the segmenter is related to this a lot. So that's why I like - It occured to me that we need that. So, and PERSON2 please prepare for the Wednesday call with like other partners by getting SLT scores delay plus flicker on one of the LSSLT dev files or other domain files. So again, with the help of PERSON3 - Ask him right now how to get it. The plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it just for one file and see, what we get there.",
            "Okay, so I'll first ask him to. That we have. Is not working.",
            "Yeah yeah, sure.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. So yeah, I should mention that loud that like PERSON2 has done tremendous amount of work for the. It was towards the end of the year. Luckily, he doesn't celebrate Christmas. So it was not a spoiled Christmas break. For any European person it would be a spoiled Christmas. So they - In the end, I'm I'm happy with the tables that we put into the, but this is something which I've been asking for since August already. So, you see that like it's it despite it seems simple, it actually takes time and we need to work this way. And I for the continuous evaluation for the ladder climbing I really do want to have that these observations being gathered like throughout the weeks and not for the deadline, because then you see how stressful it was to get all the things together. So so let's. That's for everybody. Let's keep in mind that evaluation is something which takes time. And like the presentation of that is also important and we need to do it way before the deadline is approaching. So hopefully we'll be more lucky with like time allocation for this and hopefully it will be less stressful. For both of the sessions, PROJEC210 and PROJECT2, I do already want to choose the system that the pipeline from some choice is, and this has to be based on some numbers. So, we haven't done that before, we have always used just some of the system and not really thought about which one, but let's really start making an informed choice.",
            "Yeah, so is in Czech, right?",
            "Yes, if I'm not mistaken. It is in Czech. Right. So that actually - You will need to be in touch with PERSON8, as you said, because we need to revive the PROJECT1. And PERSON12 is trying to get PROJECT1 running for himself as well. But I'm not sure how far he is, so like -",
            "Well I finally I finally managed to compile it. There was some fix I found on the internet. So, it was just some flag for linking.",
            "So it wasn't that bad, actually. And now I'm trying to train the some model on ORGANISATION243 and I was thinking that maybe I should revise which the data set I will be actually using for the for the experiment.",
            "Because most papers, actually, they are not using ORGANISATION243, so maybe it is better to use some other data set but on the other hand benefit of the ORGANISATION243 is that we have additional information about gender and speakers and there are also no native speakers there, mainly non-native speakers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Mostly Indians and so on, so the question is, which data set we want to use, or whether we want to use more data sets.",
            "More data sets. My answers is definitely more data sets, so I suggest that you choose what it - Well, there is an email that I sent already before Christmas ORGANISATION5 people asking about links to the data and they still didn't respond. I sent them a reminder yesterday, if you have seen that as well, so hopefully they will respond. And I suggest that you use all they suggest, all they recommend and also ORGANISATION243 because we really need to - So the goal is to have baseline and then to do the word cutting thing. But I think that already this baseline should be geared towards non-native speakers. So that is why I'd definitely like the ORGANISATION243 to be in there, but at the same time, I'm pretty sure the ORGANISATION243 alone would be too small. It would not be like good - it would be good for comparison purposes, but it'd not be good as a system for deployment.",
            "Okay okay. Ya ya, as for the system the - it is clear that we need to use all the data sets we have available. But I was thinking rather about some paper that might stem from his experiment and for that, it might be actually better to have some more frequently used dataset, for example, ORGANISATION244, or maybe ORGANISATION245 speech.",
            "So, whatever you can get easily and easily converted to the appropriate format, please combine all that together. And so when I said that ORGANISATION5 is owing us the list of LDC data and other links, they actually have already provided these links in some way. In work package one. So, these references are already available to some extent in and. Now I do not know which is - If it is the one point th. Let me check. PROJECT3 U deliverables D one and D one five. So D one is publicly available. D one five I'm sure you have that in your ORGANISATION131, PERSON12.",
            "Where can I find it exactly?",
            "So -",
            "I have ORGANISATION131 open - It's it's - Which document it is?",
            "So, I'm now I'm now in the search organization document. The one where we had the link for this call.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "And D one five.",
            "D six three?",
            "No, D one five. So I've just pasted the link to the ORGANISATION9 doc as well. So, D one five is this one.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yea and D one is already published. So please browse these, there is an ASR section. And you are the one - You are actually the only one who's training ASR systems at ORGANISATION2 these days. So, you should like clean or make yourself familiar with the data on our disks and put it there so net data, and not necessarily within PROJECT3, it can be also outside of PROJECT3, it can be like you have the directory, you know, the directory where to put these things.",
            "Yeah yeah, in the PROJECT3 data.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay.",
            "Sorry to interrupt I would also like to get i touch and get myself associated with PERSON12 to work on the PROJECT1 and ASR training -",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm also thinking to do some non-native speech like non-native speech.",
            "As a part of my other part of my masters thesis.",
            "So, I mean, I think the sooner i get started working on it the sooner I will be able to buil. I don't know.",
            "Because I haven't done this in the past, so -",
            "Yeah. So, is there still any benefit in talking to PERSON8 for the two of you, PERSON5 and PERSON12? Because PERSON2 will have a call with PERSON8, so should you join that as well? So that you like - PERSON8 has already written like understood some of the traces that PERSON6 left for us, so he was able to run the system at least. And now PERSON8 has left, so we need we need to make sure it's stored - the knowledge is stored with someone in the team. It can be PERSON2, but it also could be PERSON5 and PERSON12. So -",
            "So, what I was thinking that I should first view the video, which PERSON6 had recorded before he left. So once I go through that, then me and PERSON12 can decide when to have a call with PERSON8.",
            "Yeah, I viewed part of the video, from the beginning and if I'm not mistaken, some of the paths are not existing yet. So, some things were removed, so I don't know whether we can run everything which is in the video. So maybe it will be better for us to attend the call with the PERSON8, so then we are with the most up-to-date version of our.",
            "Yeah, that sounds - that also sounds. So -",
            "And then we can and then we can have call together, so because I'm actually also like to work on the non-native speakers, so it's actually one part of my of my thesis. So, but if I understand it correctly you would like to do this model using PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. Because that would be great because I'm more fan of the of the models, so we can actually compare its performance. So that will be great to cooperate on this thing.",
            "Yeah,. That would also ease load distribution for the PROJECT3 project.",
            "Okay, so the call with PERSON8 should continue right after this call?",
            "So PERSON2, when is your -",
            "No, I think I'll probably talk to him on Monday. So I'll drop - I'll send him an e-mail today, but PERSON8 is unavailable on Friday. So it will probably on Monday or.",
            "Okay, PERSON2, can you please include me with the with the mail, so that i can add it to my calendar.",
            "Yeah, sure, I'll add you and PERSON5.",
            "And probably PERSON5, PERSON5 too.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Right okay right so, I'm happy that we have not missed this opportunity for. Okay, thanks. So let's quickly move to PERSON13. Unless there is anything very important PERSON12 still needs to say.",
            "No, no, I don't know about anything.",
            "About the call with PERSON8. Ask, so did you finalize on the replacement for PERSON8? The CVs that me and PERSON5 have forwarded you, so if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that essentially he will also be training a if he is to replacing PERSON8.",
            "Yes, you were talking about the what is his name, sorry I missed that.",
            "PERSON9.",
            "Vi PERSON9?",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON9, yeah. I need to respond to that, that's my fault. It's on my to-do list. Sorry.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, so thanks and PERSON13, you have written the summary, so please present it and -",
            "And you are missing one more thing and that's the language - Oh yes, it's there, yes.",
            "It's there. So before Christmas, I released the PROJECT4 corpus for PERSON7 and this wh this week I implemented or trained speech language identification. I have a model for Czech, German and English, which kind of works on ORGANISATION77 videos in ORGANISATION7 and I tried it on PERSON4 speaking her German accented English, and it worked. It it works in online mode which delay and I'm going to integrate it to and create one simple start up script in Cruise Control so anyone can use it. And then I'm going to pass it to PERSON5 or anyone who can train other model the same way as me, because maybe we need five languages of or anything else. And then I'm going to analyse the PROJECT4 corpus. And then probably multi source training or anything -",
            "Yeah, so that the multi-source that will be with PERSON7. And one topic is missing and that's the study subtitler study where we are aiming for the end of the month deadline, right? Are we?",
            "Yes, probably.",
            "It should be doable, so let's let's give it a try. It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that. So I'll I'll write it down. So, aiming towards ORGANISATION62 deadline with subtitler study paper. Yes and then a multi-source with PERSON7 or based upon PERSON7 or - And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID? How do we plug that in, do we plug it -",
            "It will it will be audio to text worker and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class. Silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.",
            "That is that is important. Please write this down here into the document this summary, because that is for PERSON2. And also PERSON2, when you talk to PERSON10, well and also possibly PERSON5. If we have this tool, we need to ship the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers. We will separately need to ship the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the. And also to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs and this is tool which we do not have yet. That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR. So we need like a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language. So, we need to figure out. This is just one like - I just made it up this type of setup. Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker and that already is like - This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So we need to figure out which way is - of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes. So please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines. Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have this multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All going into English and then from the English will go into all of the languages. And later when PERSON12 would have multi-lingual model of ASR that language ID would not even be needed. So this is like - We need to figure out building blocs. Yeah, so - So I think like - Please think about it for a while. You have seen the sessions, you know what can happen. And I think we should have multi-lingual MT models and either multi-lingual ASR or multiple ASRs with this language ID all feeding into the same multilingual MT. And then this MT producing English and then from English we'll go to all the other languages. Does that make sense? Yeah so -",
            "I mean it kind of does, but. I mean the quality is probably going to deteriorate.",
            "Yeah, not no necessarily. For the for the multi-lingual models it's n. If if it's multi-source it should like it's it's not - It's not multi-source by having multiple concurrent inputs it's multi just multi-lingual. I don't think it should deteriorate too much if it's if it's three languages at the at the beginning. And we don't have mo.",
            "I think ORGANISATION9 or ORGANISATION8 has done something like this and they don't have an intermediate language. So it's direct from one language to another. Initially it was from one language to English and then to another language, but now they have that is essentially from one language to another language. It doesn't involve getting English in between. And it proved to be more efficient than putting English in between. So, English as the intermediary language. So, was more about how the computer had learned to interpret, or it created one language of its own. It was German and Spanish, so the machine was translating Spanish to something which only it knows and no one else and then it was converting it to German. So there was the - There were obviously language, but that language was not manually. So, it's - As someone who knows Czech and kno who knows Spanish and German both. So he or she can directly translate from one language to another without using English as a intermediary language.",
            "So, well if you could find reference to this, please let me know, but so far what you said it seems to me it's like the general statement that direct bilingual models are better than models that then output - that are pivoted. And I do not think that this is an ultimately true statement. I think it very much depends on the data available. If you have good data for the language pair then yes it is better to go directly, but if your data is more available for through English then it's better to go through English or synthesize the data for the direct language pair. And that's probably the best quality you can get. That you create synthetic corpora based on English centric dataset but you created then a direct model.",
            "So, it wasn't necessarily bilingual, it was a multi-lingual model.",
            "It was multi-lingual, ok,.",
            "Yeah, the input could be multi-lingual as well as output could be multi-lingual. So I mean that's why I found it interesting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will try to find it and.",
            "Yea, okay. Thank you. So thanks PERSON13 for the writeup. Yes, the book we definitely have to have it out in s in the middle of the year. So probably, we should start meeting on that and start writing right after the subtitler study is away.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay, so I think that's that's it for the call today. I'll try to record somewhat my suggestion about how to use the language ID in a in there so that we have it in the document and otherwise ya, have a good week and talk to you next Thursday and be in touch with the preparations for the event, so that's - And the continuous evaluation that is the - The ladder climbing is the most stringent thing now. Okay? So thanks a lot. Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Hi everyone.",
            "Hello guys.",
            "Not sure whether PERSON1 will be joining us. Okay. And I think also, PERSON5 is not joining us today because he has, what to this week. There is some hackathlone for some other project, so he will be will be busy with that.",
            "Yeah, I will also have to leave in like 20 minutes, so.",
            "Okay so, based on that. Let's let's skip to the navigation to the ACL paper. Because well, I was reading the email from you.",
            "At least, and I sort of skim through the new text. Well, I was looking at that section three point six and further, and still not enough comments from me. But, I don't know, well first thing I posted the reproducibility checklist, just the thing like to.",
            "I do not know, consider it like that. It's been probably discussed nowadays, like what needs to be in a in a proper paper, right, for a better reproducibility. It is not necessary to completely follow it, because some things might not be applicable, but, you know, a good thing to consider that. And what I wanted to ask regarding the paper. So based on the email, it seems that the that the results are better, but our automatic metrics are not good enough right now. Right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, it is just because the metrics just compared the forms in the output with the reference. But, when the when the translation is different from the reference. The forms are still correct, like from first 100 errors, or the examples that were marked as errors by the automatic metrics,. Actually, none of them had incorrect inflection in the in given context, so.",
            "I think that is quite a problem, because the first thing we tried works almost perfectly, or from what I saw perfectly. And I do not know if that is worth the paper, because it is just regular approach that already works. So, yeah, I'm thinking about ways how to make the make the task more challenging or to make the system perform worse, but.",
            "But well, okay, so that's, so you mean, it works even if we provide the lemmas instead of surface forms and it, it inflex them correctly, right?",
            "Right, yeah, yeah, I, I. Yeah, I didn't find an example where it did not work.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "Sure. Yeah, I didn't check of course all the all the examples, it is like 6000 of them but from what I see it works perfectly.",
            "Okay okay,. So again, like I've I've also added a note into the Google doc that maybe we might try some adversarial evaluation. Like I'm still curious, how much is it because it just learns to translate the sentence, and by accident it chooses the correct word, and how much it actually exploits the information from the constraint. Like, I'm not sure whether adversarial evaluation would be the best for this, but.",
            "Well, I did something like that when I only use.",
            "Well, it is not exactly the same. But I used only those sentences where the surface form of the of the in the reference is different from the form in the terminology database.",
            "And without the lemmatization the model does not work almost at all. It is much worse than baseline. But when you had the lemmatization, it works very well still. So, yeah, I think this shows that the model learns to inflect the constraints properly and is not just about translation.",
            "Okay? Well.",
            "Because in the manual evaluation there is, there is comparison with the baseline without any constraints, and shows that it learns to use the constraints much more than the baseline, and he inflects them properly.",
            "Hh. And am I, am I correct that the experiments with Paracrawl? those are the out of domain experiments like you still have the general domain model and evaluated on Paracrawl?, or is it trained on Paracrawl?",
            "You mean the European?",
            "Oh, yeah European. Sorry, sorry about that.",
            "Yeah, it is it is the same models. It is trained on Czech just without sentences that are in the European dataset and it is evaluated on European. So, yeah, it is. Well, it is not out of domain, because European is in Czech.",
            "But what I, what I would like to ask it is. Well the lemmatization is working right? by the using limitized constraints words, right? The problem is just, the lack of references with the correct word surface, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Because the problem is that when you evaluate you don't have the reference that corresponds to that and than a you get a bad result, so to say an error.",
            "Yeah, it could be.",
            "Yeah, so that, I do not have really an idea if that now we should think a different metric, maybe because just checking the, that the surface would be okay, right? But.",
            "But I'm not sure if that can be done automatically.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I do not know if anyway.",
            "But this is something for us to. I did not read the paper you getted, the new.",
            "What I think is the problem.",
            "So, I.",
            "What I think is the problem. Sorry.",
            "Go on go on.",
            "What I think is the problem is that is that it is not enough for, for long paper like that. It is very trivial approach. And it already works, so, I am trying to think of way how to. Yeah, maybe some kind of adversary evaluation will be a good idea.",
            "Like a. The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, like, yeah, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output. That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis. But I'm not sure it might give us the same anwers, like, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.",
            "I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything and.",
            "And, it, looks at the at the constraints, and, yeah, when it translates the constraints it looks like the constraints given and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors but it in fact does not do any in that sense. It makes some general translation errors but not the phenomena we are trying to solve.",
            "Okay. Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, like the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different. Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?",
            "Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and, so, in most cases they are. Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct, correct contexts.",
            "And I think only two or three sentences were correctly conflect con inflected in incorrect context, like the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be, but that was just like one or two cases.",
            "But, but you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right? You do not do any.",
            "Yeah.",
            "-lemmatization of the reference and the.",
            "Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.",
            "Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right? The one is the.",
            "It is just the dilemma score for the European? is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so. Coverage is always like 97 percent. It just generates the correct lemmas, just.",
            "Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it. So so basically the lemma coverage says like whether the constraint is there and the surface coverage difference, like, suggests that it might be incorrectly, inflected, but that is not the case because it is in a correct, like okay. Like, sure.",
            "It will need some, more difficult testing. European? is quite easy, because a lot of terms are not very ambiguous. Or names of it was names of laws and names of some European institutions. So there is not much ambiguity there, I guess.",
            "S-so so when working with the Czech data, said, you only exclude the European? test set, not the train set.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think I think that would be a good idea to go for some cross domain experiments like train on one domain and tried with terminology from the other domain. And, and this might actually be an interesting scenario.",
            "I will try to look up some other terminal database and some dataset.",
            "So you need two things, right? You need the test set and the list of terms, which is basically bilingual vocabulary.",
            "Yep.",
            "Okay.",
            "Also I we can maybe do general domain tranlation to pick some bilingual dictionary and somehow extract just general, generally rare words, not in I specific domain. From some, I even tried to do that, but, did not really work. And then I have, started with the robot, so I can return to that, but there are not many rare words in news test or anything like that and in there are, it is basically names or name entities, so.",
            "It might not be a problem. These are names and entities, but they are not often translated in the wrong way, because it basically just copying them most of the time. So we need the fine words that are translateable that I'm not just named. That is, that should be copied and yeah.",
            "Well if it is not too much work. It is definitely worth trying, but, yeah, I'm, I'm not sure. Yeah, also one question when extracting the terminology for the European test set, did you check how many of the terms or the words are also present in the Czech training data? Czech training data? But maybe, maybe.",
            "Nope.",
            "Like it would be interesting to really pick the terms of vocabulary database that is completely out of vocabulary regarding our training data. Maybe that might. That is a little difficult.",
            "That is a good idea. Yeah, I will do that I will try to extract, yeah, I am not sure if we will find any because the size of European? is still there but I can check, or at least.",
            "Well, like getting some informations about this how many are of these are present in the training data might give us some ideas like why it is working so good,. Okay, well other than that I'm not sure,.",
            "Yeah, I actually have just comment about the.",
            "Navigation, right? And I just have to comment about the dataset corpus.",
            "For the Portugese language model, right?",
            "So, I was checking the my request because I tried to ultimate the description of both abstracts in both languages, and I had to mentally, fix a few things. And, I found more papers now, and I'm trying to get as much as many as I as I can find. And I'm, I'm going to contact, someone I know here in Brazil that knows other conferences as well. So maybe I can find more data about that. So I am certain I can improve our, these data in coupling? domain what I, what I'm going to do now actually is just to have it correctly done, because maybe I still have some, some problems with this abstracts in both languages. And what I'm going to do is try to find a model to translate from Portuguese to English, so we can have the papers in Portuguese also translated. So, that is, or what I'm going to do for now. And at the same time, I have to find a way to help us this new result rate.",
            "PERSON6, do you have some estimate how many sentences in the training data do you have available right now?",
            "Yeah, but there, it is a small number, because, I'm always counting the abstracts so far so.",
            "I have around 200 something. But it is really small, and I'm going to prove that. But, the problem is that these are the ones that I really checked, and they are okay, but I have to distract more.",
            "And make sure everything is working. And unfortunately, it took, a bit more time than, expected as always.",
            "Well, this is, this is manually checked. So it does not make sense that it is a little bit costly, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we plan to use this for, for the evaluation, right? So you already, are you also.",
            "This is for the training part of it as it explains the document.",
            "Well, okay.",
            "I need just to make sure because the idea PERSON1 suggest me to just check is to use the editor auditing to me and a coding domain in the training as training data. So I'm just taking this but first to have the training data first and then I'll go to the evaluation. Because I was worried that I have to find these papers first and I think that now we have something and probably we will have more as soon as I have an answer from this.",
            "-person here in Brazil.",
            "Okay, also, you probably did not get any response from PERSON7 yet, right?",
            "No, not yet. So that is why I'm I'm looking for second list.",
            "Okay, PERSON1, do you have any idea should we bother PERSON7 more with the question about the English Portuguese data, or?",
            "Sorry, I was not really paying attention. So PERSON7. Well, was it PROJECT2 overlooked data that you were helping to get from PERSON7, or was it some something she would generally know about because she is Brazilian.",
            "Yeah, the idea is that since she is Brazilia, she may know some other conferences that have papers in Portuguese and about the, the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she has not responded to your question by email?",
            "Not yet, yes.",
            "Maybe if I forward that email, she would respond.",
            "Yeah, I checked it later, and I did, and I have not added you in the email, so.",
            "Yes, so maybe forward that email to me, and I'll, I'll forward it to her and will see if that makes any difference.",
            "Yeah, yeah, probably, yeah. But, as I was explaining, I, I will check with another researcher in Brazil that I know and, and maybe can help with that, because she used to work with in Portugese here, so probably.",
            "Yes, but also like you yourself you have been studying Portugal, so, it should be easy for you to locate this conferences.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Someone and that is good, sorry, go on. Go on.",
            "Yeah, well, I just thought that you, you should be able to locate these things yourself equally well, and PERSON7 is also quite far away, for, quite some time, from the research point of view as far, as I know. So it is possible that she does not really, know, any more than you would.",
            "Yeah, yeah, maybe actually she, she, she used to work with that. I used, I did not work with Portuguese in NOP, so I, I did not have access to some of these conferences. But, yeah, I know a few. And and I will try to look them down to them at first, and maybe I can. I can find another one set.",
            "So, so, so maybe just Google for well computation linguistics in Portugal.",
            "Yeah, I'll try that but it English and they do not accept the papers in Portugese, so that. I'm looking for that one set that have these papers in Portugese.",
            "Another good resource will be master thesis. So University repositories, these days, generally across the world start to publish all master thesis and master thesis are often written in the like local language. So I would also search for, like, university master thesis repositories, because you will know the good universities, you would recognize them immediately, we would not, and then that would be a good source as well.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "So forward that email to me, I'll forward it to PERSON7, and, like do not expect much from that,. I think yourself will be also equally good in finding these resources. So maybe the master thesis are a better chance now.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Okay, so the bottom line is that our system is way too good, and we should probably try testing it in the cross domain scenario. So hopefully I know. The thing is that we would like to extract the European data completely from the training set, but we want to avoid retraining the model, right? So again, maybe finding some other.",
            "I think it does not say much about the quality because everybody has access to European data, so let's let's use just artificial example to.",
            "-to make more work. But, I think it would be better to find something that, you know, we do not have to implement a part of the training data we have, we have because, I'll try to certainly I'll try to find some more difficult phonology more anything like that, maybe our university have, some maths terminology for, books for translation of math books into Czech, maybe something like that. But I'm not sure if the books are really parallel. But, yeah, I can have a look.",
            "Can you go for the. I assume you are now talking about contraints experiments in the paper draft so the baseline fell thirty point something is quite good as indeed, if there is a problem, can you go for the elite, the sao domain? There is at least some, specfic terminology and also.",
            "Yeah, the CL domain could be, possibly another such resource.",
            "Yeah, I can finally look into that.",
            "Ot that will be in the eliter test set. Is it?",
            "Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch when we were talking about PERSON1, But one thing, is, that, that the blow is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually, But that is that is another, no, not problem, it is actually good that is right, yeah. So I was thinking there might be. But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer? Like you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs. But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been might be an interesting like a distinct, distinct scenario. I do not know, PERSON1, do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?",
            "By by style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?",
            "Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task. But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, like it instead, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena. Like I'm not I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover. But and the idea is that the style of the sentences, it gets quite vaguely defined. So again, not so sure.",
            "We have this corpus of sentence transformations. And, one thing that is there, and could be labeled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general. So details are omitted, the sentence is like simplified, and than making the sentence sound colloquial, and, making the, making the sentence. Well, just a paraphrase. And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening, of the sentence. For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with english Czech but we do not have any reference data there. So we do not have any sentence compression dataset. So maybe the generalization that could be of interest but, I'm afraid that there are toom many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization. And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for exmple, this could be done for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset. So there will be a root-based generation of, some sentence counterpart.",
            "I guess that is actually like interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.",
            "That is, that is actually a very good idea. So we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of PROJECT1 test set that which would cover that. So that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so the, the best, if you are, maybe I'll, I'll share the screen and browse that. So do I, share screen.",
            "Also also can you like include the links for the for the data or at least.",
            "For the dataset.",
            "Yeah yeah, into the document, that would be helpful.",
            "Yeah yeah, so let me open if it ever responds to my key strokes. PROJECT1 test set. And I will actually include directly the particular document within this repository. So this repository is organized in, and you should read the reading here, it is organized according to indices, so ideally would use an index of some documents within this that would reflect what you are after. So multiple documents can be included in this index, and he will be evaluating against particle indices. But there is, at the moment, no index for, this domain specificity. But if we look at a certain non native, spoken language translation, then within both defset, and also test set we have this auditing, So here is this auditing and that is an English the OST. I'm not sure if it will open the. Yes, so this is this is the english: dear President Kala, a distinguished guests, I am very honoured as European Court of Auditors. So there is some term and here we have translation, we have two translations into Czech and one translation into, German. So if I open the German here then an if I open the translation into, Czech than. Names are definitely used names as the, terms that could be that should be preserved, Than, so this article set document is rather short,. I'm not sure if will contain much but in the test set part IWSLT nonative testset, The both sao-consecutive and are the auditing domain and again we can try, translation into Czech, so. So, here is again the court of auditors, finance risk or, there could be, yeah, things like. So there could be terms, that are far away from this. So obviously, to extract the terminology some manual work would have to be done by comparing the outputs of the DMT with this. And figuring out, what are the common problems with the terminology. We also could use what PERSON2 has worked on the remarkable, so PERSON2, can we can, we reuse the markables in some way as the list of terminologies that should be translated in some way in a particle way? You are still muted. If you are saying anything, PERSON2?",
            "Sorry, so it is like there named entities, right? It is like.",
            "It is, yeah it is not necessary end entities, not at all.",
            "I mean, I guess why not try.",
            "So,.",
            "Let me give you, I guess, some examples or, So, there is your favourite example, like the tenant and tenant.",
            "Like, you know, it is just the word tenant and sub-tenant in Czech and it was both translated to tenant. And than it was both translated to tenant, and then it was an agreement between tenant and tenant, which loses the sense. So I'm not sure whether like they are very important to document, but. Pardon.",
            "Yeah, so that is the particle thing here would be, then the WMT PROJECT1 testsuite, also in PROJECT1 test set, The document that PERSON2 was referring to. These, these are text only documents, and they also contain this terminology. So if we look at the English and checked, from some auditing report. The cooperation between the two supreme audit institutions and the two countries based are based on something. Well, Yeah, there could be taxes. Some types of taxes. So this is the audit reports and the document, that PERSON2 was mentioning. Is, this, sub-lease agreement? So, it is a sub-lease agreement between two persons and there is some tenant and some lessee. And the problem is that the tenant and lessee have to be translated in a distinct way and it happens very often that the tenant and lessee are translated both as in both cases. Also these two entities these two parties in an agreement, they have their gender and the gender has to be preserved in order to for this to make sense. So, I suggest that we, I'll I'll paste the links there. Data. An auditing domain. And, also possibly CL domain for this we have little or no reference translations though so that would have been manually checked. So for the sao domain I do not know how to I'll probably just highlight this sao that is the part so it can be also sao-WGVAT next to this. OST equals English source. TTCS, star equals check reference or more. And then we have the written audits. And the written audits are in this directory,.",
            "We have annotations for 90 lines of the audit and 30 lines of. So I could like export markables or.",
            "And we could manually check what is their correct translation, or we could trust what the annotators did. So for every line, we know whether there was some markable in that line identified by any of the annotators. And we know which of the translations were good of that particle markable, but we do not know the exact correct term on the target side.",
            "Well, we know it has been in a the reference extract.",
            "The reference of what? Because we do not have the alignment. So people are marking the source site like the label is attached exactly only to the words on the source side.",
            "Yeah, tha-that that is true, yes, but like, yeah, but we have we have the sentences with any detective sentences which contained the correct label.",
            "Yeah, we have sentences that contain the correct, manually validated translation, so that could be quite easily extracted. So I think that is probably the best setup. We know that all the systems were pretty bad with this. The markables experiment was done on a subset of the WMT PROJECT1 test set, right? So, for Bles core evaluation, PERSON4 should use these documents from the, the spoken ones, and the written ones sao domain speeches. And for specific terms evaluation these could it be extracted the easiest from the WMT 20 testsuite markables by PERSON2.",
            "Okay, thanks, this sounds great I already have to go, I have to supply some exams.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thanks yeah, thanks.",
            "Yeah, Okay, PERSON4, so well, hopefully you will be able to understand this draft and ask me if you if you want any further assistance with like explaining which parts are which and so on.",
            "Yeah thank you see you next time, bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye.",
            "So, okay, I do not know. Is there anything else regarding the navigation?",
            "I do not think so and.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I have a lot of work to do and.",
            "I, I think that I can help basically with that.",
            "Um-hum also it would be. It would be great if you, if you if you get together that the English Portuguese data, because again, this seems like it will be smaller. Small, like what is what is the term, more low resource domain, right. So we might see that it helps much more when the amount of training data is. So so that will be was so nice.",
            "I'll try to finish as soon as we can.",
            "And have this first adjust.",
            "Okay, yeah, okay. So regarding multi source, we have some data from PERSON8 she promised without any comments, because she is also finishing some of her projects, so she is still busy. But we, yeah, we do plan with PERSON5 to look into that and finally make some conclusions about whether we can use it for our, for our experiments, or whether the task is defined, which will make sense. I do not know, PERSON1, if you have seen the data like there is a thing, there are also some word document, so hopefully the conversion won't be that complicated, but.",
            "Yeah, I have not looked at the data from PERSON8 yet, but it depends. Normally, it is doable, except for sentence boundaries and like paragraph boundaries. These are often screwed by the basic text should be okay.",
            "Okay, so yeah, hopefully I will get to get to that this week and Felix? is going to be busy because of the hackathlon. And just, we were talking about having a call about the data. So probably next week, Monday, after this meeting. So I do not know, PERSON1, if you if you want to join it would be definitely possible. Yeah. Or like this is this is just a preliminary plan, like we can move the call somewhere next week, but I think Monday after the school is fine. Okay. So there is that. And. Yeah also, PERSON5, mentioned that, yeah, he is he is been busy with the some annotation work for the University of USFD, that is. That is Sheffield. Okay, so yeah he is he is doing some anotation for Sheffield. So that is that is why there was not much feedback from him. Yeah, so that is that. But I think other than that, there is nothing else to discuss today. So if no one has any questions, we can probably leave it at that today. Okay, so thanks and see you next week.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you see you.",
            "Okay, by. PERSON1 = uvadec bez obrazu. PERSON2 = clovek s maskou, mozna \"Josef\" PERSON3 = Portugalec-Joao? PERSON4 = Ondrej Bojar. PERSON5 = Vilem?

            "Okay I thought that the thing you send to us it's somehow like. Connected to the.",
            "Well it. I mean, it's for some other project and it uses just urine models. That's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, then I didn't say anything, sorry for that.",
            "Well okay so that's covered. Let let's move on to the multi source I guess. We were... Last time we were discussing that we're waiting for the or try to get the some relevant data for the task, right? So, PERSON8, I guess you.. Did you get the response from.",
            "No.",
            "The ORGANIZATION3?",
            "No response. Maybe I should try to.",
            "To forward this message to the other alters of the paper. Because I sent it only to the first alter, Who is PERSON7 and he didn't reply me. Or haven't replied me so far. So.. yeah, maybe I should give it another try to forward it to other co co-alters.",
            "Okay yeah, that will definitely -",
            "But.",
            "Not hurt so.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So okay so we can we can try focusing on the PERSON12's data set. Like she said that she should have some time... Like she was busy until the New Year's but now she should be available. So I will try to... Well I'll send her e-mail that we want to discuss it and we'll see what her response or, I guess I guess we can we can try to arrange the a call with her, Where we can discuss like the details about the data set. And and maybe what are options for that minute.",
            "Okay.",
            "So... yeah. I think that's our top priority right now because otherwise we will have to rethink the our options right. So... okay. -",
            "Maybe.",
            "Because I'm I'm now I'm in Slovakia, I'm like moving to Prague tomorrow, Then going to the PCR test on Wednesday, Waiting for the till Thursday to the result. And so we can, if there is all this negative, So we can meet on Friday in person or something or. Or just discuss it like I mean through Zoom.",
            "Yeah yeah we can definitely do that. But I think PERSON12 is currently working from home so we will still have to -",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "But yeah, definitely an option.",
            "Because like I'm saying that, Because the next week we have like Hacathon on universal let's say universal coreference with PERSON4, PERSON9 and PERSON13, So I'm not going to be like available for like other things I guess.",
            "Okay, that's fine.",
            "For the next... during the week.",
            "As long as we're able to make the call with PERSON12 I think it's it's going to be alright.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm thinking that the thing is that we probably. We have like three maybe four weeks until the ASR deadlines, So I'm not sure whether we can make some initial experiments for short vapor. This is it's quite sh like.",
            "Short reach?",
            "Short reach.",
            "Since we don't don't even have a baseline right now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well so we'll see. I also included to the to the to the minutes that I found a paper, They where they were analyzing the usefulness of the of the context encoder in the document translation. So it's not the same thing we're doing but we can definitely be like the conspiration about... for the analysis. Like the idea was that they have architecture with two encoders, The one is to for including the input sentence. And the second encoder includes the context. So the sentences I guess in front and behind the same the input.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "And... And they like -",
            "Is it like, Do do encoders of the same language yeah?",
            "Yes and I'm not sure whether they tried both shared ways and separate encoders, But the thing was that they also tried to replace the context with just the randomly sampled sentences and the results were similar. And also the results were somehow better I think about one point better one point bl better than the single included baseline, So I think their conclusions were, that the second encoded does not really encode the context,",
            "But it does help to introduce some noise which helps the robustness. I think they were evaluating on the IW - assaulted data set.",
            "It's just like regular regulazation or something.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Something, something not like drop-out but definitely there's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some regulazation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so we can for example chat whether in our scenario it has similar role but, In our case when we are translating paraphrases, I think the assumption is that we can definitely swap the sentence and the paraphrase, They should be interchangeable from the definition, right?",
            "Yeah. I think I tried it in my experiments.",
            "But I don't remember the results now, But I think it was. Yeah. I just don't remember now.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So so that's one thing, We can also try sampling some random sentences instead the paraphrase and - Well, we can do similar experiments and see how it behaves in our in our scenario. Yeah okay, so that's that and I think that's that's everything for multi-source, If you don't have anything to add.",
            "Yeah, I just want to say that I had basically the same results in my last aesthesis, When I used second encoder for the context. And even will sample the random sentence from the data sets. And you get basically the same enclosing blue as with as with the correct sentence, So... yeah, two encoders work better but even with the with the random sentences. And it worked the same with the random sentences as with the correct ones so. It was so maybe some kind of regulazation or maybe just more perimeters and yeah I don't know what...",
            "Yeah, yeah, it's kind of tricky. Because the se two encoder setting kind of works with the multi-model translation, Or at least there were some adverse serial input experiments, That's shown that certain architectures can actually exploit the images, So I guess the question is - how to exactly represent the context, Or in our case the second input sentence. Again, this might be easier cause we're just imputing two semantically similar sentences, So so the encoding of these should be easier than encoding like contextual sentences or something.",
            "And sorry, what's wrong by just like appending the paraphrase to the original sentence?",
            "No, no.",
            "It doesn't work.",
            "It doesn't, okay.",
            "Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's it's... I don't know how much BLEU points lower but it was wa.",
            "Because, because like the way I believe Martin does his little translation so. He translates more sentences at once and then picks only the center one and goes like this for the whole document. So the context is like in one together with sentence we actually want to translate.",
            "Yeah, I think was wasn't even Dominik doing some experiments like that like with the, what was her, with Ivana? I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they again, Like they were attending the context or concatenating the context. With input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation. But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely, Sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting.",
            "Like everybody is different, it's definitely, different calculation, Different leader, but it's I'm surprised that PERSON8 says that it doesn't work full stop. I think that's that it's it cannot.",
            "Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it.",
            "Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test. And it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders. And I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up. Depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding. So, so maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence, Maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever i don't know. I, I it also behaviour also could be different for the old sequence to sequence methods compared to transformer, So for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so you maybe like you need to whatever increase warm-ups number warm-up sets or.",
            "Yeah, so just know like.",
            "I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what. When I started in summer with those multi-source experiments. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also, I defenitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position. I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, Yeah and I just remember that it did abunt abundant this compenetration stuff and tried multi encoders.",
            "Yep.",
            "And it was it was probably due to low scores.",
            "That you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase based output and the attention is like double diagonal so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's suprising that it didn't work.",
            "Yeah okay.",
            "So, if you if you input the phrase based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, rigt?",
            "That you like fully rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.",
            "Okay so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence seperator token, right? You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?",
            "I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like. Because in the first version we had the like we thought that or, Sorry, we had a suspicion that the token. Could be also tokenized itself so then I replayed it with another token which is not, Like it's not only for this propose because we used some pretrained dictionary. And this dictionary didn't like contain like seperator token or yeah. So I used some token that I assume that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear and like in once but. I had I had no guarantee that this token couldn't could not appear at the other place in the senctence that is the only place it could appear. So it could be done more properly, yeah I agree.",
            "No, we definitely should consider these like constructive or baseline, we should probably.",
            "The other problem was with the sentence lenth, Because you have to specify the maximum sentence lenth and when I like, It was like one hundred tokens or something and so if you compenetrate, okay like, Compenetrating two sentences is okay but if you have multiple paraphrases then it's, yeah.",
            "You can easily exceed.",
            "So.",
            "One hundred.",
            "So but we are. Are are we going to. Aren't we going to limit the experiments to only like a sentence and single paraphrase? Like basically bars of sentences input, Just for simplicity or can are we going to consider multi sentence input? Like I guess for start is we can just work with bars.",
            "Like single input sentence, like no sentential context. And how many paraphrases that is a question but to start with one is also okay.",
            "Yeah, I think so. Okay. Well okay so basically these are the details we can discuss later, Like the top priority right now is getting the data set from PERSON12, And hopefully it will be suitable for our us, And we can talk about the next steps like the baselines and the variations of the.",
            "Sorry that I joined late but I was in another meeting. And I heard PERSON10an talking about the deadlines, So the is that a EACL deadline? No EACL is only a DEMO deadline in on Friday the fifteenth of January, And then there is ACL at the end of the month if I'm not mistaken, So like first of.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I see it's I see it's.",
            "First, first of February.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But there's an abstract submission a week before.",
            "Something like that, So I'm not sure whether you can submit the paper, If you don't submit the abstract before like I think it is mandatory to submit the abstract, Or I'm, I'm, I'm not sure I'm, I'm not familiar of this format so.",
            "Anyway my question, Anyway my question was if with what are you aiming for this if anything, Also if anybody could check the future deadlines, How many will there be in the coming months, So that we have other plans, So we have like a pipeline of attempts.",
            "You mean for confeerences? I guess we can like I hope that PERSON6 will update the NLP conferences calendar, Or it seems that he was updating it because there's some conference, Yeah interspeech in February or maybe March so, I will ask him whether he was updating it. I think he will handle it this year also, Oh there's an interspeech on twenty six March, But I'm not sure whether is interspeech relevant to us is more like PROJECT2, right?",
            "Yes, I guess so.",
            "So we should search for more that's what I was saying so the also beyond what PERSON6.",
            "Yeah, right now it seems like there's nothing until June so it's probably not filled in so.",
            "So there is TSD as well but is not even listed in conference's list and the recent advances of NLP became Bulgaria only so. So just as a reminder like PROJECT1 does not ask us for much. So we should make use of this opportunity to do good research kind of connected to the PROJECT1 itself, So whatever ideas you have it's good to export them now.",
            "Yeah, I guess as far as plans go like, If I remember correctly John and PERSON5 are planning to have at least a short paper for the ASL and try to submit, Well or let's let's move on to the embed list navigation to see to just recap the what are the what is progressed so far and.",
            "We already submitted the sh. Sorry, We already submitted the short paper for so I think we hope to do a proper paper but, yeah. We didn't really start writing yet but we should, I have some results.",
            "There would be the conference, then would be the conference, So full version of the short version.",
            "Yes.",
            "And the reviews will be returned in two weeks from now or.",
            "Yeah. It's like twenty.",
            "No really will be the twelfth or. Arrive, okay so there is a review deadline, yes, on the twentieth, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So now we are we are going to write this paper but we need some results, So I think that use of this training model for negative constant along with the input, And for my side I started looking for data sets to train an English-Portugese model, So I can help with the something else maybe because, This was one idea from gave me to, Maybe to train a model that I can, See the output and now and advice how we how we can improve the output, Or or regarding the reflections or something like that because in Czech I can help much, right, So that's the point, And at the same time I was trying to know more about C + let's say, Because I want to help since everything is in armenian, I need to at least understand the cons and maybe can edit properly, So that's what I'm doing now and I think that I can start training the model this week and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm just proccessing the data sets I found so I can.",
            "So there are also further data that PROJECT2 is already like collecting anyway, And since the domain is probably not very relevant like you can uise any domain for youe experiments, Then maybe we could well so the point is that you want to use the same domains as are in the PROJECT3 experiments, right? So the IT domain. Or what domains will you be aiming at? What's the model? Or you train on anything you can get?",
            "Sorry? So well you are going to focus on English-Portugese? No, no. Because that's the language you can read that's clear, That makes very good sense. You are going to focus on constraints because. That.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is what PROJECT1 needs but then question is what will be the domain of the underlined text, And since you mentioned one more language, This language is also Portugese is.",
            "Oh.",
            "Among the languages that we need to target in PROJECT2 and if you edit also the domains that PROJECT2 is interested in, Which is for like fun reasons, comprehension linguistics. And for PROJECT2 reasons auditing and PROJECT2 could also benefit from edition model. So we could have like a dedićated English to Portugese model, And the positive constraints that could be essentially replicating or building up on what PERSON5 has done, They could be used to improve the terminology in the partical domain.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So.",
            "So yeah.",
            "So just like I just wanted you to benefit from that, Also from the PROJECT2 side and.",
            "Yeah, perfect.",
            "And one of the use cases in the PROJECT2 because the congress. Which was supposed to be in the auditing domain is now like, Due to Covid split into two parts and whatever, We are probably going to add the comprehension linguistics as another domain, And there we could benefit from the constraints for terminology.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So before you start training please make sure to extract from me. And especially my colleagues PERSON11, You probably also were in touch with him, right?",
            "PERSON11?",
            "Yeah PERSON11, yeah.",
            "PERSON11, I don't remember now but maybe I will check.",
            "Yeah, then please also extract further data and also, Let's make sure that we test that we create dedicated data sets also for Portugese within our PROJECT2 asset, That maybe you can rewise also the domain of comprehension linguistics, So you will have to invent Portugese words for well and these things, And then yeah, yeah so I assume that OPUS thanks, Thanks PERSON2 for the OPUS data, There is also in addition to this there is also the data from ORGANIZATION2 websites, And what we will be very short of would be Portugese comprehension linguistics data, And maybe you could help with that if we scraped some institutes and their web pages. And did back translation from monolingual Portugese only data.",
            "Okay.",
            "So like.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Let's, I definitely support the idea of having a dedicated English to Portugese model, And I would like to make sure that you use the constraints not only for the PROJECT3 use case, But also for the use case of terminology and then the experiments, like would be doubled, They would be done from these two sides, And the terminology would be best tested in the auditing domain and in the comprehension linguistics domain, So that would be beneficial for PROJECT2.",
            "Yeah, I haven't think about that when I was just trying to make.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The data so just whatever I find and I would use that but this is this makes sense, I will I'll try to get the correct domain or define.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The proper domain and data sets for that, About the spreadsheet shared PERSON2.",
            "That was not spreadsheet it was Corpus OPUS the web page.",
            "Okay, I didn't check it, okay.",
            "This I, I, sorry go on.",
            "I just wanted to say that like or something like that but the linguistic's domain or that's kind of hard, right?",
            "Well, yeah, I found a few, I'm I don't know exactly, yeah I would have to talk about that, And and see what I'm going to use I didn't define that so which domains I can use but, Okay is good to know about that so and if I can help with would be better yeah if in both projects so there's no.",
            "Maybe just to add due to PERSON1a suggestion how to get the domains or comprehension linguistics domain in Portugese maybe there is, There might be some conference in NLP or comprehension linguistics, That's help in Brazil or Portugal that we don't know about like which language, One of the languages Portugese because we had such a conference here in Czech republic or Slovakia and some of th, Like there are very few of the papers but some of them are in Slovak or Czech so there might be something in like Portugese as well. So that.",
            "Okay, I will check it.",
            "Could be another source of the comprehension linguistics or the linguistics domain.",
            "Okay, perfect I'll look for that, I think that's the plan, okay.",
            "Okay, anything else? I guess again like everyone was on holiday so you know, PERSON5 is there and the progress with the single set tadada.",
            "No, not really I, yeah I've already disscussed that before the holidays, I think we did I finished implementation of the of printing out the attention weights, From all the layers all the heads in Marian so I want to analyze that, And but first I think I should somehow gather all the results I have on the new data from PERSON3, And I think I've already shared the link for the new paper with PERSON3, right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "On slide but I didn't write anything in there, It's just the same document as.",
            "It's just the outcome. Yeah, yeah, but I will soon put up, put in all the results and I'll try to figure out some kind of explanation for them, But basically what I found out is that the method works somehow but it's definitely not the complete solution, It's better than not using it but it's far from like getting correct core, correct force from of the consraints, And yes, so that's good because we can show that maybe we are on the right track, But there's still work to do and we can analyze, Okay what I want to do is now is to the our breakdown analysis, And find out if there's something we can do about edit some type of errors, So yeah I think that the thing I should do first is to write the results I have into the paper, So PERSON3 can look have a look at that and yeah.",
            "Yeah. Still over you the reveal we are previous submission knuckle one, And I'm really planning to do that I just didn't got into that, Maybe if you could share the link as well, So that I would be edit already in the new paper than in the old one.",
            "Oh, yeah, it will I think you don't have to read all the paper, It's will be basically the same but we bettering new results so I think it will be better just to read the old one.",
            "So do I have a link or you shared it so far only with PERSON3.",
            "I think I think it should be somewhere publicly but maybe you are not in the channel, I will have a look I, I posted it on slide but I'm not sure where channel off.",
            "Yeah, I don't really follow slide because it's.",
            "I can I started.",
            "Too tiring.",
            "You can share it into chat.",
            "I shared it into chat.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Turn the shared in the chat.",
            "N actually no so this is this is the way it doesn't work, so.",
            "Yeah, you are correct, yeah, you told us to share it in a different way, yeah.",
            "And I think it's only PERSON5 the one who created the project who can find out the link.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the way I do it is that, I put this editable your L in comment on the second line of the document so that's so that later on one can always find it easily.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe share the link through the document from the agenda.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The notes, the agenda.",
            "So it's persistent or more less persistent.",
            "So is it this one? Like from I think the one in ORGANIZATION1 working.",
            "I don't, ORGANIZATION1 doesn't work for me at all right now so I don't know but.",
            "Okay, but the link is accessible, right? Okay I will fix the formatic.",
            "Hope so.",
            "Actually it is, but I can share it. It's there.",
            "Well so, yeah, let me know if the link is working or if I guess PERSON5 should check it and if not just please fix the link, Okay other than that I think that's everything or, Okay just a reminder there will be probably call on Thursday at 4 CET so if you want to join definitely you are invited as ussual, And I think there will be reminder from on Thursday so, But other than that I think yeah, everything we needed is covered so yeah, let's let's see each other next week.",
            "So just for PERSON1 and PERSON8, could you please.",
            "Okay so the rest of us can leave, right?",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Okay, thanks, bye.",
            "Okay, see you guys.",

            "I'm good, you?",
            "I'm fine, and everything is fine.",
            "So.",
            "Where -",
            "To Iran, I mean you.",
            "Were in Prag. You were in Prag so you went back to Iran.",
            "Yes, yesterday morning I arrived.",
            "Like, was there any specific reason?",
            "Oh no, no, it's for New Year, Just coming back a little bit sooner.",

            "Yes, hi PERSON7,",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes I just yes I just arrived to Iran and I was talking to PERSON1 about that.",
            "About what? About.",
            "No, no, I just arrived no I just arrived.",
            "I.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So I wanted to check if my voice is okay.",
            "Yes, its good. I'm in the corridor here, So I'm supposed to wear the mask but yeah, But, no one see, But, another colleague will come probably, in a second, yes, So I'll switch to loud speakers. Is it still okay?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, it is.",
            "Okay so, Since you are here, now, I'm very curious about the progress or problems that PERSON1 is possibly having.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, the librolum that I'm in right now, In automating the PROJECT1 data set is, So, we normally use the Petri environment, virtual environment, In, in ou, in our pipelines. But, users are different,",
            "Right away.",
            "Oh.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so I haven't thought of that as a problem, But yes, So, that requires a special environment, which will combine these two, right? And are they compatible or incompatible?",
            "I think it is compatible, There, is, couple of things which, couple of packages which are missing, So, today, about around one hour and one hour to us, I, I & # x27; ll, have a call with PERSON9,",
            "And then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.",
            "Yeah, so there's, another thing, Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs to one setup. I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs. So you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,",
            "And you collect all the output files, And then you run the evaluation. And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more. So there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, And we need the numbers very soon. So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason, Then, you can still keep the, the translation running for the remaining ones, And re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on. So, it's, the point is not to create, a serial, sequential processing that includes both, But the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it, like, as, as a way for in s in slices. First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.",
            "Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same, So I have separated the.",
            "The, the script that I wrote, that I had written earlier, That had oh, both of it combined, But right now have separated it, So I was, But then I remembered about the service call, So I didn't test it.",
            "Yeah. A now,",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "I can test it.",
            "Yeah, so please get the number. So, so far, you don't have any numbers for the rebr right?",
            "We have for a couple of that, but not every. Oh yeah, we have for a couple of that, but not everything.",
            "Yeah, so I would, really like, you to, prepare, the table in the delebl. So obviously the numbers will be still missing, But the table is important, Because I need to review the structure of the table, What, what are all the components that you are going to, to report, For what all language pairs are you going to report, I need to check that the table is, is like understandable, And then the numbers will arrive.",
            "So about the numbers of which number you would like us to report, So there are like a bunch of them, P C N ceedwer, So which.",
            "So the let's, let's use the same, set-up that we used for the evaluation in this, serge, no, it's not.",
            "Okay.",
            "Serge, I think yes the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Preparing for the, SU1 and meta forum session. So let's use exactly that those.",
            "Okay.",
            "So for most of the files, is the setup, Which includes the segmentation as an evaluation criterion, But for the, the names files it is, just the, the bag of wor or the set of words.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Well, it is important that, that this is mentioned next to the table.",
            "Yeah, I mean, I can add it as a footnote.",
            "But the.",
            "In the.",
            "Yeah, so the table is, is in the delebl is technically similar to the table that we were preparing previously, for the PROJECT1 search. It would be now just much larger, like more language pairs and more, more systems, probably.",
            "Okay C Or maybe.",
            "So I.",
            "But more language pairs.",
            "Then I think we'll have, okay, So we'll probably have to create two or three tables,",
            "Yes.",
            "Like that,",
            "Totally agree, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "And.",
            "Ideally, ideally, collect the numbers in separate files, And then have a script which compiles these numbers into one table, So that the preparation of the table is, is quick and you can quickly regenerate the table, So that you do not like, copy-paste the numbers. Coping individual numbers is always error-prone.",
            "Yeah, so I mean the script that I have right now is, generating the, generating the results in our tabs of credit value, So it's a psf file that. So we can open it with Excel or something else.",
            "So can you paste the path name to this file to the search document? So.",
            "Which one?",
            "Here, so, PERSON1, the, the D T S V file with the results.",
            "Okay. I mean, right now it wo have anything, Because I have just removed it, But we have s results for some of it, But part.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So please, put some of those TSE file, with results so far, And then please put it here into the search, document.",
            "Yeah,",
            "Yo, okay, yeah, thanks, So mah, we really need this, It's already Thursday, And next week will be, some people will be still working on Monday, Tuesday, possibly Wednesday, But then, no one will be available in the Czech Republic on, Thursday and, and Friday. And then, people way it, it depends what, what people do, But this is like Christmas break from the 24th to, the first is the Christmas break, So people are usually on vacation.",
            "Okay.",
            "And.",
            "It's alright, I mean, oh.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, what I am going to do right now is, I will basically copy paste the entire thing,",
            "I mean the, the script that I have in two different folders, And then will, run it with different, the little different, inside workers, So that, I mean, yeah, so that I have, let's say ten, Well instead of a output a file by a side worker, So that we have, So I'll just, make sure that these things like, for a single file is there from all the available workers are getting generated parallelly.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Oh, that, that would save our time.",
            "Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize the, everything actually, Parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, Because he would need to run this many times, There will be errors, you need to, re-run this quickly.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, so thanks. So you are very busy with this, I, I, I don't want to put any, any other things, for you, So, let me start with the reminders. We need to finish the, description of PROJECT1 desk set, Who do we have here? Oh well, not really, yeah, it's done and it's not here unfortunately. So this is, this would be like for PERSON2, Then the evaluation, this is for PERSON1, But we have discussed this. Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here, and push, the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Okay, thank you. We have PERSON5, that's good, So for, PERSON5, I would like to check, what is the progress, in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you, whether you are in touch with, with PERSON1 also for the evolution, which is like, more important. Can you hear us PERSON5?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, this is about to about your last letter or not yet, But I will start with it, probably after two today,",
            "So th.",
            "So n.",
            "Yeah, the, the last letter is, that calsru has some modules, And, we need them evaluated, If we, as like, as we can, And there was a letter to both you I emailed both to you PERSON5 and, and PERSON1.",
            "So, yeah. Just work on that so that's, so we haven't done anything new in the meantime.",
            "Not yet. So this is the most, important right now, yeah? Like this evaluati okay.",
            "Weeks on that we have the most morals in the integration, And, the multi-source experiments they are also important, but the delebl is kind of okay, PERSON4, right? So, PERSON4, how bad.",
            "About, PERSON5's, work not being part of, not extending the current delebl.",
            "Sorry, what do you ask?",
            "So the status of the delebl on, on multisource machine translation. You said It's kind of okay, I still haven't, looked at that. Do you think that it is good to go without button providing anything into this very delebl, Or.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, yeah. So that means that bottom multi-source experiments are important, But they are not so strictly urgent, that, they would have to go into delebl, We can survive without that.",
            "So they are not going like.",
            "They, they are.",
            "Not, not this year, not this year.",
            "Not, not by then yet, Because I.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, if you have them, if you manage to get the, the baselines.",
            "Okay.",
            "Person of day five way and forty-three way systems, If you have them, that would be great, But, like if, the, the training is something that you probably can't manage in that short time.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, so please, so for, What is the delebl number? It's five, no, it's four point something, Or three.",
            "Four point two.",
            "Four point two, Four point two, Evaluations of existing, models, would be, great, We do not really expect, any results of, newly trained systems. So PERSON5, this merges the, the, yeah, simply focus on the evaluation. Focus on the evaluation of existing syst.",
            "Okay.",
            "And this, yeah this, the evaluation is like common to both of the tasks, Both the domain adaptation and the multi-source. So they, do, do you see it that way, Or is the evalu do you see the evaluation differently? I see the evolution has common to both these set-ups. So t.",
            "I only see that the, the models you, you say that the models are not maran based those it might be probably something else how to exactly run it, but more or less.",
            "Yeah, okay, So, so simply do, do the evaluations with PERSON1 and put them to the, to the table. Yeah. Okay, thank you, With PERSON5, I think that, and, and also with PERSON1, let's, let's agree on some time tomorrow. So that, like we would double check. What about tomorrow at ten? Would that be good for both PERSON1 and PERSON5? So that we see the status of the evaluations.",

To do some, domain adaptation, but we can I'll, I'll try to get the data and see what we can do, let's not focus on the delebl, This is just for you to know that this is, this is coming, And similarly on the same day, there could be, subside link exercise for us again for the group, play.

            "Okay.",
            "I'd rather have it from the app then the.",

            "Not yet known. PERSON12, will find out, So, okay, So thanks, And then we have a few more minutes, PERSON4 has reported and, the better release of, of the speech in a British corpus, That's perfect, and also the D 4 2, is ready for review, So I'll, I'll do first review myself, and, the evaluati yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all too confusing, yeah. I reviewed the I reviewed it myself, but, PERSON4 has already shipped it to, the reviewer from Pervoiz, right? PERSON4, is that correct?",
            "Not yet.",

            "Well I'm, I'm trying to learn, cow bi, Maybe that's important for the upcoming, upcoming, events like the Malach conference. So, I don't know, who else is familiar with existing, models f in caldi. Maybe, maybe someone can, give me a head start with, the existing models, and maybe some, fine tuning for these models.",
            "So I know that PERSON10 has successfully docorize caldi model by PERSON3, So he can at least easily run it.",
            "But.",
            "That, that's not like.",
            "If, if I re.",
            "But, by, I think that dokr isn't working on class.",
            "Yes, the, the, that's correct, but, that means that, like, from just the infrastructure point of view or from the software engineering point of view PERSON10 knows, how to get starting and what are the inputs and what are the other relevant files,",
            "Okay.",
            "So not the dokr set-up, But, the, the command, itself, It's, I, I saw it this morning in, in PERSON10's screen, So.",
            "Okay.",
            "He answered in some way, Which, gives the performance that, that PERSON3 had, But I don't know the, like how that model was created, And PERSON10 also doesn't really know. So, so were you in touch with PERSON6 on this?",
            "Sort of, but, I haven't enough time to, meet.",
            "Yeah, I'm, I'm surprised, That I don't see PERSON6 here today, Because he still should be available, And please speak with him again and get in touch with him. There is some video recorded,",
            "From your launch.",
            "From your launch.",
            "I, I have the video. But I haven ’ t seen it.",
            "Okay, so that's, that's important, So please have a look at the video and then get in touch with PERSON6, Yeah. So to, watch the video by PERSON3, Then to contact, PERSON6, PERSON6 is normally not available on Fridays, So, then to contact PERSON6, Possibly PERSON10, could help, with, launching of caldi understanding what are, model components. Okay, yop. And, in addition to this, we also need to discuss the collaboration with. Yeah. So, yeah. With PERSON7 discuss collaboration. Yeah. So, that ’ s probably better, Then PERSON4, I presented you, But do you have anything more to add? Did I miss anything?",
            "You made about my progress this week.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I don ’ t think so.",
            "Yeah, okay, good. And then we have PERSON8, So PERSON8, what, We have discussed the, the SLTE and PROJECT1 test set integration, So.",
            "Whom have you successfully, Or has, has PERSON9 actually, successfully, been in touch? So, for example is, is PERSON5 now, using.",
            "Some TV to get the put files.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, yeah. So the you are working on the index files as, for the a multi, for the multi-lingual set-ups, And.",
            "Yes, exactly. I think because I, I just saw his email, I think, Pudan could answer the e-mail, But just for your information, PERSON9 is waiting for you, If you want to contact him directly. We can have a meeting, and also I can be there, because now I'm available from now, and we can talk about any issue about SLTV test, SLTV and, PROJECT1 test. This is the first thing, And.",
            "Is there anything, Is there, is there some issue, Is anybody blocked, or.",
            "I think PERSON1 is in contact with PERSON9. I think all the, I think, yesterday and also today, in one over day, will they will have another meeting,",
            "But PERSON5, I think, just in, true e-mail, And they don ’ t ha they didn ’ t have any direct contact. But anyway, I think, this don ’ t hesitate, because both of us are available from now, and just PERSON7 for your information, tomorrow I will, meet PERSON9 for two or three days in person,",
            "In person, yeah.",
            "And we will talk about all the small details we have spoken in the SLTV and everything. And I hope, on Sunday evening or Monday morning, it should be exactly the, everything should work exactly in the way.",
            "Yes.",
            "As we still have on this, whiteboard.",
            "Yes, exactly. I have the photo of it. Thank you.",
            "So yes, that ’ s the whole thing.",
            "There is, there is no step needed from me. What I have to do is to, see the tables, That PERSON1 will prepare. The B.",
            "The templates of the tables in delebl, And review the delebl that, that PERSON4 was, working on, But the evaluation itself is something that you all will handle, between yourselves.",
            "Yes, just.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Everybody yes that,",
            "Do you mean, do you mean PERSON1, PERSON9 and, and PERSON5.",
            "PERSON5, exactly, yeah.",
            "When PERSON9 can ’ t the evaluation, Because, it needs, access to, And.",
            "So that.",
            "Access to the.",
            "Yeah, so that ’ s exactly one more reason to have it divided. I think that you PERSON1 should run these systems and put the output somewhere, And, then PERSON9, he has access to the cluster, then he can continue from that point and run the evaluations. So it ’ s, it.",
            "Oh, yes.",
            "There ’ s no need, there ’ s absolutely no need that, it would so cash as many things as you can. This is slow and heavy, this, So we need to, have the outputs cashed. And by the way we also, this is the repository that, that PERSON2 has prepared for the output, So, has PERSON2, been in touch with you? Because.",
            "Yes, so I, I, I spoke to him yesterday, And I explained to him the working of the script that I sent him,",

            "Okay, so technically 21st and 28th will be cancelled, I can ask PERSON4 whether he has different plans or something but yeah i guess?. Okey. So. Good. Other than that. So regarding the last meeting with the partners. Good news is that yeah they were not bothering us with paraphrasing or over integration, so it's not that hot. We got additional work. But it's not that much like basically since we are not writing any deliverables now we will - We? to review one of the deliverables. I'm not sure, whether we were assigned, which one. There's a dissemination and quality estimation or - Hi PERSON4!",
            "Yes yes, quality estimation or? to PERSON4.",
            "Okay good so we have the more fun deliverable.",
            "Like it was first assigned in the other way around but then PERSON4 asked for the other deliverable and -",
            "PERSON4 faught for us and now we - During the -",
            "Said that he would also like this deliverable but then -",
            "Yeah obviously. What's the review dissemination. Okay so basically I guess me and PERSON4 and maybe PERSON5 we can we can review it but we don't need more than two or three people on that. Even two people should be more than enough, right?",
            "Two is definitely more than enough. Like that's -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It will be good to have someone aside from me, because I'm a -",
            "Okay, I can -",
            "So -",
            "I can I can vulunteer. Yeah. And back to back to the vacation I was discussing with others that on 21st and 28th most of us will have holidays or days off so we can cancel these meetings? Or do we want to have them anyway? PERSON4?",
            "Yeah well I'll I planned to be at work on 21st but the kids got their extended school vacation very likely. So it would be hard for me probably anyway.",
            "So so -",
            "So let's cancel those two.",
            "Yeah, since there is nothing urgent until the end of the year I think we can we can have these two meetings cancelled? And the next one will be on the January - January the 4th, right? So I guess we can agree on that, right? Yeah, okay. So other than that, let's discuss the multi-source and? navigation, so - Regarding multi-source PERSON5 we are still trying to collect the data. Like I wrote an email to PERSON1 and she said that we should bother her after New Year's because she has some other deadlines. And you probably didn't get in any response from the ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "No, I did not.",
            "Okay, so are there any other options? Or like technically when we get the data from PERSON1 we can start working on it.",
            "So that's fine. And I can try prepare at least some baselines for the multi-lingual multi-source translation, which can be like separate set of experiment.",
            "But I still haven't got to that. But I guess that's it regarding this task right now.",
            "Yeah, I'm like I'm not working on it much. Or I have't been working on it much this week because I'm still working on the like side project of PDT we just - They asked me to help them since I'm li. I was working on the alignment in PCEDT on the last PCVT so - Yeah but so, so I hope, like this week I will finish it then and I can again concentrate on this stuff.",
            "Like in January.",
            "Okay yeah so I guess I guess that's that's all regarding the multi-source. And or so let's move to the? navigation. So if I'm correct you are focused on the positive constraints rigt now, right? Or are you -",
            "Yeah so -",
            "Yeah,.",
            "We're still working on the negative co. Now in order to train the model for negative constraints. So as to generating the data for that actually we're using a? as we have discussed and it's almost done but it's still processing. And at the same time now I'm going to start to investigate if the problem with foreign flection happens or and with negative constraints? constrain the code, right.",
            "So you're preparing data for the negative constraints, because you already have the data for the positive constraints.",
            "Yeah, yeah perfect but -",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON2 has to train the model -",
            "Using negative constraints in the input. So.",
            "I need to prepare that data, and so it's too it's too processing. I have the test set of? but need to train set as well, a translaton of that so - I'm preparing it and I think it'll be ready soon. A part of that I'm using the Marion implementation of negative constraints to -",
            "Did you manage to get it done?",
            "Does it work?",
            "Sorry? I didn't -",
            "Did you manage to get it run?",
            "Test that yet.",
            "Okay okay. Yeah I didn't I didn't test that. I would try it today.",
            "Perfect.",
            "And because I'm I'm still finishing the code to the rappel so I was -",
            "Yeah sure, of course.",
            "Because I think you will run into some problems, because I'm not that?.",
            "Oh yeah.",
            "Probably but -",
            "I asked?",
            "Something feels weird, tell me, because I did not really test it that properly. But it should work, somehow.",
            "Yeah it should.",
            "I'm not sure about the batching. I didn't look into that. I know I wanted to implement batching but right now I'm not sure because I think it didn't feel worth it because all the sentences were separate in the files either way. So I think I only use it separate sentences. So I'm not sure if you can - Like if the if the input files format for the constraints allow for more than one sentences or input but that's like a really easy fix. But right now I'm not sure if it will work with more than one sentence. But if it doesn't just tell me and I'll fix it right away.",
            "It just can - Can I just to make it clear for myself. You you're saying that you can process only one sentence at the time. But yet on the other hand, you also were training systems for the constraint decoding. Or is that is that something different?",
            "No, I mean for the for the constraints that are done in the dec Marion decoder for my - For the modification sided to decoding for the negative constraints with the trees and the stuff we discussed like months ago.",
            "Oh I see, okay so -",
            "Because all the all the test set was just one sentence. Each file was one sentence. I think I did it like the stupid way. I called Marion each time for each file and - I think it's possible. I didn't implement using more than one sentences profile but -",
            "Oh yeah.",
            "I's like probably the format so.",
            "Oh I see. So so the other, the more efficient method was just appending the constraints.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "The training is like this?",
            "Is just about the modification of the decorder.",
            "I'm I'm not sure about that, but it - If it doesn't work it is easily fixable. But the Marion constraining is inference only li right? You do not need it for -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Training so -",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So I think it's not such problem that you can only process one sentence at the time. Okay.",
            "We'll see. Well, either way -",
            "That's for the that's for the negative contrains because for the -",
            "Yes.",
            "Positive constraints, it's only data manipulation. You just say that in the training data what in the source -",
            "Oh yeah I tried like really simple baseline method that I used all the subwords from the constraint and add it some bonus to the soft pocks for these tokens in each steps but -",
            "So that's the positive constraints. It's or -",
            "Yes, that's that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints. With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding. Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams. And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff. But for the positive constraints I only tried - Or I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff. Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.",
            "Okay, so back to the positive constraints. Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?",
            "Yeah right now I'm I'm kind of waiting on the dataset reprocessing from PERSON9. Also PERSON9 I had a look at the code and I think I know why it's so slow. Because you for you for each - Yeah for each entry in the terminology in the Europar reprocessing. You open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it. But you only you do that -",
            "Oh yeah?",
            "Like 14000 times -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And you can do this only once, right? So.",
            "Yeah -",
            "We are doing it like 14000 times. So I think that is probably the problem with the speed. So if you just move that before the four loap, it's probably -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's probably okay.",
            "I will check that. Europro I had to start it over again because of the what you said about the English term, right? So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Since it has just started I can I can change it in and save some time.",
            "I think it should be much faster than that. Like yeah, for the analysis I started to work on - Or, I'm almost finished with changing Marion in a way that it outputs all the attentional incoder decoder attentional weights. So we see what the decorder look set when it generates some work. And we can check if it really looks at the constraints when generating the target constraint. If it looks at the source constraints. And yeah, so that's important issue? that's almost done. And then we have to figure out what we are looking for and what we want to see there, I guess.",
            "Okay so technically, yeah, we can, we can discuss it even like? Monday meetings. You can update me.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "During the course. During the week. Yeah okay, so that's fine. And I guess that's that's everything like - Is there anything else we need to discuss now? PERSON4 do you know when are we supposed to get the deliverables from the -",
            "I haven't checked that -",
            "We we -",
            "Do we have that? flink already? Is there?",
            "Probably not. I guess we would get an e-mail. Okay I will -",
            "I will keep an eye on the on the on the updates.",
            "If I remember correctly it was on in a week from now, the first complete version. That's what I asked for, 21st. And then some updates still may come over the over the Christmas break.",
            "But hopefully no later than on the 21st, we should get the full version. And I hope I actually - Please ask PERSON3 earlier, because I think it would be better to have an a preview already during this week.",
            "Yeah I will do that. Basically just at least some text to review, even if it's not complete.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah okay. So I will I will check the? and try to keep the eye on it. And you said 21st? Or when should we get that?",
            "21st is the first version and I think the deadline, like for the deliverable to be submitted is the end of the year.",
            "Yes.",
            "31st.",
            "So, I remember that for PROJECT1 I was doing this from last year, from some cottage in the mountains. And I just realized, shortly before the New Year's evenings that I need to submit it. And so this is also something that will happen to PERSON8 I'm afraid that he could be - Well, no party, but maybe at the remote party. And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit a?. So there will be no review of like at that point. He would simply take the PDF and upload it so.",
            "Well, okay. So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail?",
            "Please I think better to send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link, in advance.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yep thanks.",
            "Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?",
            "Yeah, so for the?",
            "Okay PERSON6.",
            "I hope there was't anything for me? Or?",
            "Not not specifically.",
            "Okay. A good news is that the paraphrasing or? was not brought up last Thursday so.",
            "There are other or urgent things right now so it is fine. Okay so if that's all I guess yeah see you see you next year I guess. And have a nice holiday.",
            "Yeah yeah exactly. So PERSON6, if we could maybe stay here for a little? for the outings.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Otherwise, I agree with PERSON7. I think PROJECT2 is good and safe from our side.",
            "Okay so -",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Have a nice Christmas if possible.",
            "Have a nice Christmas? Yeah. If possible, exactly. Bye bye.",
            "Bye.",

            "Hi PERSON7.",
            "Hi.",
            "So PERSON3 is gonna be there in a meeting?",
            "Yes, I think so. Should we -",
            "Then I keep it today, the key word.",
            "So he told me to share video. Hi PERSON4. PERSON4 has also joined.",
            "Hi, hi, how are you?",
            "Hi. Mike is muted, I guess.",
            "Yes, now we are unmuted. Hi, hi. PERSON3 said that he would join us. He has written me five minutes ago. He was somewhere in the city center. He is running in the direction of the university, and he will have a very quick lunch. So he, I think he will join in about twenty minutes or such.",
            "Thank you. Okay, okay.",
            "So I was I wanted to discuss the one - PERSON4. Today PERSON3 did send that TD ID for keyboard extractor in the minute, did you did you went across that?",
            "Oh no.",
            "That mail -",
            "You sent what?",
            "PERSON3 did send in the minute group. In the minute, a ORGANIZATION2 group, he did send an email. Oh -",
            "Aha, keyword, yes.",
            "Yeah, so I did try it for ar the minute which we, which we did the dry run, the dry evaluation of -",
            "Oh do. I think I should first read it. I don't know anything about it. So I -",
            "Okay.",
            "Well, this is some. Yes, I have read it.",
            "Okay, so. I detest this TD ID of keyword extraction. On the minute which we were doing the dry run.",
            "For the one which we had nine minutes, and we evaluated it. For the same meeting, so it gave it gave so horrible results. It was, which was the keywoard extractor, and laugh. These were the two words.",
            "Because they are the most frequent. It's -",
            "Yeah, so I said to PERSON3 they are really bad. And PERSON3 agreed that he said that they are they are - Seriously, they are hilarious. So so the but Felix has today written to us. And that this he has some TD ID of base summariser. So -",
            "Let's try that one. If it gives better results. So he has written some TD RF based some keyword extractor. His own programme. So we will check. But the one which was from C Uni it's not good.",
            "C Uni. What is C Uni?",
            "ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Ahaa.",
            "So PERSON3 said me to discuss with both of you. The how these results came for that.",
            "So he said that it's all says the task is very difficult.",
            "Yes, for sure it is difficult.",
            "Yeah, actually because a meeting data, it gives you the most, the maximum probability words. So the most occurring result.",
            "Meeting data?",
            "Oh what? Meeting data. Yes, yes, yes.",
            "I didn't -",
            "Yes, yes meeting data. Like our meeting data. It gives you most commonly occurring words which are like hallo,. All thots all those words, which we usually say. Because our like ORGANIZATION1 corpora meetings are not something which are set up, then they are like in an organized fashion. They are not played. Our meeting is something which is usual meeting. So these are the common words which are occurring. And that is why the summarizers are giving such horrible results.",
            "Okay, so - Can't we pre-process those occurrances?",
            "We can pre-process, we can remove -",
            "Summarizer.",
            "Yeah, we can remove that. But anyway, still, it gives sentences which are not relevant. Like -",
            "Using TF ID, right?",
            "Using not TF ID but other approaches as well. So that is the problem I tell you of meeting. So PERSON3 said maybe you can include in your motivation to, shared task or some paper, maybe. This these results that these commonly occurring words which we saw in this TD ID. Like a and like laugh so you can include them is motivations of these are the common occurring words. Which usually which we usually we extract when we are doing summarization for meeting data.",
            "So that is one of the biggest problem with, meeting summarization.",
            "Okay.",
            "So you can include that point into your shared task maybe. So this is something we also noticed it very early. That these are some random words, which are the usual words which we speak are occurring into the summarization of - So this is the biggest drawback of meeting data, which needs to be handled someway.",
            "Um-hum um-hum hi?",
            "Oh, PERSON3 joined us.",
            "Hi, sorry for the delay. I was at lunch. And I need to go to the court.",
            "You were extremely quick, PERSON3.",
            "Actually the email, the e-mail got sent only when I was already sitting at the canteen so it the email was delayed.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "Yeah, this is needed because I'll have to move to the court there. Okay, yeah, so PERSON7, about the venue. So, have you found these SIGDial dates?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Yes. The SIGDial dates like the submission deadline is January fifteen. And like the timeline for SIG Dial, all the other dates are not published yet.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "I went through. Yeah, but I went through the previous year SIGDial dates and possibly they will follow the same timeline.",
            "So the notification comes after one month. So if you, if we say, January fifteen, by February fifteen. We should know that whether we are accepted in SIGDial or not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Going by the other years and then -",
            "It is earlier than after - SIGDial itself is earlier Interspeach. So I think it's very risky.",
            "So we. Yeah, so we would have three months before the paper submission deadline.",
            "So you know, like SIGDial special session is just like Interspeech special session. So like, we have to be totally dependent on the SIGDial people for running the special session. Because it will be an like integral part of the program. It will not run as a parallel task.",
            "Parallel session. It will be a part of the programme.",
            "This is - This is yeah, this is preferable if we make it timewise. So there's there's a critical problem. So if the timing is harsher or not any better than Interspeech, then it doesn't make sense to go for SIGDial, because the SIGDial itself is earlier. So if we, if we cannot get the benefit of being integral part being in their proceedings, then I would prefer Interspeech satellite even.",
            "Yes. So that's - So, another? for SIGDial is like - The papers that would be submitted in our shared task would be reviewed by the program committee of SIGDial. And they do not guarantee that whoever our participants are. We can like in choose and invite that who would be presenting. Because -",
            "Yeah, that's that's okay, like I would not see that as a big problem. Increasing the quality of the shared task paper is fine. If there is enough time for the submission. So there is a critical thing. So PERSON4 I've I've read that document things already. I've opened it already in the morning. But the problem is that I haven't found the paper submission deadline for a SIGDial, and that is critical. If the paper submission for SIGDial is similar to what was our submission for the system outputs. Then let's do SIGDial. But if the paper submission deadline for SIGDial is earlier, if it's around the time as the submission deadline for Interspeech. I mean their main one. Then there is no point in going for SIG Dial.",
            "So I will just post the timeline for a previously there. So you can understand that how e.",
            "I put I paste it to the document that we are browsing. Tha.",
            "Yes.",
            "Summary.",
            "Yes, I did.",
            "But do we have resources for all these yellow things? Like scientific community members, invited speakers, submission for process. So are we able to do that?",
            "To review the papers?",
            "No, to create all this around things. Scientific commission large enough to handle paper reviews. So it's create our -",
            "To make a programm commiteee. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I think it's we can do it. It's not too bad. Like I've done it for a few MT marathons.",
            "Okay.",
            "Several years ago. MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML. That was in the first year when that happened. And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers. And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon. The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue. So we have, even like said, your system, your tool is interesting. Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people. But your paper is too bad. You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.",
            "Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial. Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.",
            "That's yes, that is that is opt like. Like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues. So you have - They have final paper registration July. So the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.",
            "Was May.",
            "So it was -",
            "And this time it is in July.",
            "June, July, August, September. It's four months approximately.",
            "But actually, when you create this as if somebody from outside, from good summarizes, summarizers say decides to take part in our shared task. Anyway, he would never spend on it more than two weeks, isn't it?",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's right. So yeah. We cannot expect more involvement than two weeks of person -",
            "No actually just the reality that the perso.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Works and - So probably it's not such a problem. And the application process is definitely easier. And -",
            "For what?",
            "For SIGDial.",
            "I don't know. I don't think that the I don't think that the application procedure for us is easier.",
            "The preparation is easier. You just say that we want to do that and that. And for s for Interspeech we have to pre create the separate action.",
            "Yeah, but what I'm worried is that the timing of SIGDial is equally bad as the Interspeech special session. Or worse, perhaps.",
            "I, I personally would propose that we should have at least four months buffer time.",
            "Yes.",
            "Like four months time, where we done Interthing.",
            "Yeh.",
            "And and the deadlines we are able to choose. So in that respect, I think if we get into Interspeech, that will be better for us.",
            "Yeah, I think so.",
            "But again, the SIGDial thing is probably like what PROJECT2 is saying. That it is probably, it's already established to attract more participants. And that the application proposal we already have, so it's easier.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I would I would still prefer the later timing. I think it makes more sense. Because you have to - I agree that the people would spend two weeks working on the submissions at most in some. But they need to have three months of sitting, just or like having it on their to do lists. And then in the two weeks, they will do it.",
            "Yes.",
            "But they need to have this time of not doing anything and still knowing about that.",
            "And also, another thing like, it may so happen that it happens in many shared task. Like we relieved the data, and then the participants come up with many problems that we can't see right now.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "And then we have to fix those and then again re-publish.",
            "Yeah, and if the time is short, then this very in high risk.",
            "Yes, yes. So it happens in almost all the shared task like - The first, the first challenge is released, and then the participants come up with, okay, these are the problems in these data. Then they release another version. Yeah, it also happens.",
            "And it's better if this doesn't happen in WMT this doesn't really happen often. But that's a very established task. You know exactly what to do. And even when preparing the data for the shared task, everybody knows what to do. And so the in WMT there are it is a rare thing that the test sets are updated and also the training data. It's it is a rare thing rather. But it would be, I think it's it's more likely for our minuting, set up. So yeah, I'm I'm definitely in favor of the later deadlines. If so we hav I said four months. So what is the SIGDial twenty one is already in June, right?",
            "Yes, yes, the fifteen.",
            "Yeh, so that means that the deadline for papers for their like regular papers for special session papers would be march. And that's the same timing -",
            "Let us say March, yes.",
            "Yeah, this is the same timing as Interspeech the official one, the special track set up. And that doesn't fit our needs.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I think we, we actually have to do - If we get accepted, we should try and try to get accepted. And we really should do Interspeech satellite event.",
            "Think I think we should start to preparing for that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What do you think PERSON4?",
            "Tak jo.",
            "No, for me it's totally unrealizable work. To -",
            "Aha, I don't see it like this.",
            "I would not do that. Never. So I am not able - No, any event -",
            "For this. We have PERSON7. So I don't -",
            "Okay, so for me it's very hard work. So I feel just individually -",
            "It's not you -",
            "Hard work for less income. But if you think the time that later time is more important, I totally agree. So -",
            "I think the later time is very important.",
            "So if the weigh the weigh is are such, I totally -",
            "And I've done five MT marathons. And they're -",
            "Yes. You have a lot of experiences there.",
            "So it's it's a work that has to be started soon for the invited - But actually an MT marathon it's. I know the people. So that's the difference. So at MT marathons it's I like just ask around, and actually I myself created the structure of what I would like to hear. Half or two thirds of the structure were known from the previous years, because there is this summer school aspect. And then, I th like thought what other topics? What topics on the side would I like? And I specifically asked colleagues who I actually knew before if they would if they would come. So and they knew MT marathons. So there was a different situation. It was only logistics and the work for like putting the program together was less of less of a problem. Because people knew what to expect. They were they were willing to come kind of anyway. And when they were invited, then like they saved some of their travel funds or something like that. So it was it was easy because it was in the field that I know. I -",
            "I think I think this like inviting the program committee. And that, you know, because when we have a problem, we know people from the summarisation committee. And we can reach out technically research to them.",
            "Yeah, that is fine.",
            "So the other thing I am just a bit worried about, like because, Interspeech is all about speech, right. So for any reason, suppose if we do not get into Interspeech, what is our backup plan?",
            "If we don't get into so then we will apply for SIGDial, yes. But they also have the option of separate proceedings for SIGDial.",
            "Yes. So, like the program committee would choose, the qu the people that they want to appear in the proceeding. But if we want to create our separate proceedings -",
            "We can do that.",
            "We are free to do.",
            "Yes. So we can also run it as a SIGDial thing. But without - And again in PBML.",
            "Yes. So the papers appearing in SIGDial proceedings are okay? We don't publish in PBML? Those who are not appearing in SIGDial proceedings we invite them for PBML?",
            "Yes. If someone manages to that's good. So if someone manages to do it in time, for the SIGDial deadline, yes, they should go through the SIGDial submission deadline. And if they fail, we invite them to send it to PBML. And yeah. We will review it ourselves.",
            "Yes, yes. So -",
            "Maybe - The same thing also for Interspeech. So like there would be -",
            "Exact for Interspeech we have to do that.",
            "Yea l ba. Because for Interpseech we can even its fu. We could also like split it paper by paper. So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings. And some Interespe some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So there is an absolute strict requirement. And I think it's they cannot have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth publishing. Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event. So yeah, I think it's okay. So we do not need to ask for a special session in any of oh well - In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that. In Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. If you do not, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.",
            "Okay. But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event. Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.",
            "Yes, we will do the proceedings of PBML.",
            "Yes, so but so you want to say, like, if someone does it earlier, so they can send it to the Interspeech.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Oh, okay, okay. But that will be a total surprise thing, not -",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it is then from the outside - From the outside it will be just a coincidence that, like in the in Interspeech they are presenting this. And at the satellite event they are listed as a participant in the shared tasks. And in the overview paper for the shared task, we are citing the Interspeech paper and not the PBML paper in the PBML proceedings.",
            "And the same applies to SIGDial.",
            "Yes, yes. I, I think, it may make a bit complicated. Because we won't know the result of the Interspeech satellite event until March fifteen. By that time, the Interspeech deadline would already be there.",
            "That's. I hope that we will know. But, but obviously, yeah, we need not - Maybe they will be late. So, maybe we will tell us only so late.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But then, okay, then never mind if someone is working on the thing for, for years,. Then he can do it in the two weeks until the March deadline. And if someone is not working on that, then he will have the deadline for our PBML. Like I don't see any big problem there.",
            "Okay, okay, so - So the thing is like only right now we have to like prepare the proposal for both.",
            "Yeah. But the one for Interspeech is the preferred one, in our case.",
            "Because we have to submit it soon.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because of the portal is already active. And, as the year said, that they would need at least one month for the. In Dortmund?",
            "Okay.",
            "And then, and then after? in Dortmund we have to send it by February twenty eight to them.",
            "And then they will do another round of division.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so let's okay. So it's we need to apply for the ORGANIZATION7 membership. And am I'm afraid that you cannot do it - Well, maybe Misis PERSON9 could do it like for you. Because, so it's probably bound to a person who is who is a member, a person or an institution?",
            "An institution can take or a person can take. So for th eperson it si very less, for student.",
            "It is just twenty euros. So -",
            "Okay.",
            "So I can do that yeah.",
            "But the question is whether this would be sufficient for them, or whether they would need the institutional -",
            "Oh, I don't think like it is required institution. Because once you have the logging ID and password you can submit.",
            "Okay,",
            "You can submit the author proposal, yeah.",
            "But they will probably consider it differently if it's submitted from - I don't know, maybe you had that person responding. So double check with them if a student price would be a student registration for ORGANIZATION7 would be okay. And, or whether we should do the, the institutional one. And also, is it annual? So, is it like for twenty and then separately for twenty one? Or is it for a year.",
            "Oh I think it will be for three sixty five days.",
            "Okay, yeah. So in that case, I think - And how much is the institutional?",
            "It's it's for package it's to fourty euros.",
            "Sorry say again. Fourty. Four zero.",
            "Two hundred fourty euros. Two hundred fourty euros.",
            "Two hundred fourty.",
            "Two four zero, yes.",
            "Two four zero versus just twenty.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, that's a big difference.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so let's let's try t yeah the student one. Right?",
            "Okay. Okay I was just I was just asking that -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Like we -",
            "It's best to ask.",
            "To I was just mention that we have only one membership. So if it's required that all the organizations have a member ship or not.",
            "And in that case, the institutional is better, probably. Because the institutional is, I assume, that the institutional is kind of like for five researchers and two students. Or something like that, already. If you have the institutional one, you don't -",
            "Yes, if you have the institutional one, then you don't need that separate thing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So for full mem so full member regular rate is one year is sixty euros.",
            "And for a student member for one year, it is twenty euros.",
            "Yeah. So -",
            "And for institutional member package A it is two fourty euros for one year.",
            "Yeah, so that corresponds to four members from the institution. So that's like that's without knowing these numbers, I said, it's like for four researchers and two students. So these two students are for free. So that's like I made the estimate exactly correct. So, yeah. So the best thing is to ask also PERSON1 and - So this entitles people to attend Interspeech as well, right? No, obviously it is not the conference fee, but it is a reduced conference fee, then. Right?",
            "Like one to - If one has the membership for ORGANIZATION7. Yeah, they will have some, some discount at the Interspeech conference.",
            "Yeah, so I, I suggest that, you email PERSON1 and ask him, what is preferred for the department. If we should go for the institutional one, or if we should, go to - Because there are more people possibly. Also PERSON2 or these are the speech people kind of. So it does make, it can easily make sense to, do the institutional in registration anyway.",
            "Okay. So so who should I ask I didn't get it.",
            "Yeah, so yeah well. I would say I would in general ask PERSON1. PERSON1 at ORGANIZATION5. Because he is the former head of the department, and also, he knows about all the projects who are here. So he would have an estimate like how many people could possibly be interested in taking part in Interspeech.",
            "Okay, okay,. But I'm not really sure that if one has a ORGANIZATION7 membership, they will get reduced fee sessions at Interspeech. So that I'm not sure.",
            "And can we check from past Interspeech conferences?",
            "Okay, okay that I can do.",
            "And also SIGDial is also ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION3. So it's either or like et. That means that the registration for ORGANIZATION7 is also probably sufficient for SIGDial application.",
            "Yes, yes, oh, oh, okay, I saw. So they have reduced fee for Interspeech, yeah.",
            "Yeah. So please -",
            "Once you have the ORGANIZATION7 membership.",
            "Please put these numbers, the student versus non-student to the email to PERSON1, so he like sees the differences. And he would have an estimate like how many people potentially could take part in Interspeech.",
            "Okay, okay,.",
            "Yeah, so that's yeah. I think we were all said. This is yeah, this is all clear at the moment, at least to me.",
            "Yes. And now, like so since we would start preparing for this proposal, we have to the major thing that we need to is - Make our scientific committee like we have to now reach out to people.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Very quickly, and prepare the website, and like prepare the call for papers on the website, like make up website and do all this stuff. So yes.",
            "Yeah. So when creating the website, it's best if you email PERSON5 so it is PTAL email at privetly.",
            "Can you like write in that doc maybe?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah it will be better. I put it at the very top. So, oh, I'll make it. Oh, I can only suggest. Never mind. Contacts sorry, contacts for preparation. So PERSON1 and oh ask for preferred type of membership. Give numbers to ALST meeting. How much we will save waste by institutional one. And PERSON5 at ORGANIZATION5 and always carbon copy me. Ask for the best set up of web page. Before that browse for some of the projects that we already have. So, for example, ORGANIZATION5 ORGANIZATION4 ORGANIZATION8 CZ in the visual genome. So this is something like as a sample project. And PERSON3 suggests ORGANIZATION5 ORGANIZATION4 ORGANIZATION8 CZ PROJECT1 minuting. Yeah. Okay, so I think this is also clear. And then I'm thanks to PERSON6 for the evaluation. Had so have you seen the outputs of the of the extraction of key words that PERSON6 ran?",
            "I discussed with them.",
            "Not yet.",
            "But they did not see it.",
            "Yes, so. It it was just yeah, it's it's better to see like.",
            "Yeah, So actually PERSON8 has given some -",
            "I haven't opened them yet.",
            "I haven't opened that yet. Have you?",
            "So I'll try that. I think that's?",
            "How come that it works for how come that it works for PERSON8? Is it TFIDF based on our collection? So that it is like that -",
            "No no. No, so it is it is like I haven't run it so - But the dictionary is not all based on our corpus. That is something which I saw.",
            "Yeah, so it would be good to learn from PERSON8. How come that it works, or what they do. And it's good to have reasonable baselines.",
            "So this is exactly the thing that we wanted from Arion for quite a while, and we never got it. It was not the like when, when PERSON4 asked for that. It was not the first time that I asked for -",
            "I'll do that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I can see, okay -",
            "Can you share if you are opening the PERSON8 outputs, can you can you share that please?",
            "Yeah, so this is something we did notice very early. Yeah, so this is - No, I haven't tried the PERSON8 outputs. He has just shared his code, so that needs to be applied on our data.",
            "Oh, so you haven't - I thought that he sent the outputs.",
            "No, he did only send the code. He did send the code, not outputs.",
            "But he said, that it's that the output is decent.",
            "Yeah, he said so. He claimed, but, he hasn't any snapshot or no results. Something isn't there. So I need to run it. We need to run this code on our data to see how it performs.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is something already we noticed very early. I did when - When I just started, I did notice that the most frequent words, which are like, hello, can you hear me something like those words are something extracted from the meeting data. So that's the maximum probability words which are most occurring words are mostly fetched by all these lexical methods.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. So please, please run it yourself as well. Because he said, I ran it on some of the meetings, and the results are decent.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So -",
            "Yeah so.",
            "Check it if it's decent.",
            "So so let's check.",
            "Because what we got from the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "From the KER at linda that's not decent.",
            "Yeah, so let's yeah, it's let's check if they are. Otherwise, I'll contact PERSON8 if he has run on our data.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because that's our meeting data. I think he has run out our data.",
            "So I will check with him. Yeah, okay, so that's probably everything from me at the moment. I'm now opening the document by PERSON6 the progress report. See any changes. What is interesting? So while we have resolved the comments of PERSON6. Is the correct that you, for both the evaluation and also for the automatic summarization the methods you mention. Can you easily run them right? Like, birdsome or -",
            "Yeah, so actually, most of the codes.",
            "Yeah, actually they are already there in one paper implemented.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that's not much to implement, because that's just running their own code. So - Yeah, but h but have you done it. I like know it should be very simple, but it's often take some time. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah PERSON7 also has implemented it. So we. We both have it.",
            "So can maybe can PERSON7 share his screen, like, what is the current - What is on your work bench, so to say. What what you can immediately use for either meeting summarization itself, or the evaluation of that. What what you can do, can you can you share it on your screen?",
            "For the you're asking for the metrics, right?",
            "Either metrics or the summarization itself, whatever you have.",
            "Okay, okay. Yes, so I shared that few weeks back.",
            "About the metrics.",
            "Yeah you have the document prepared now, yeah. Just -",
            "Okay, just let me share again.",
            "I think PERSON3 you already had a look yeah.",
            "Did I?",
            "With PERSON4 I think. PERSON4 did show you.",
            "Okay, that I don't remember that. It's possible.",
            "Yeah, PERSON4 metioned. So I have better extracted summaries, actually, I will send them in the same email.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, so better than TED ID, much better. So that can maybe act as a baseline.",
            "Yeah. And well, I don't see PERSON10 on this call. Are you in touch with PERSON10? Is he attending most of these calls, or not? Or is he working separately?",
            "No, he is not attending.",
            "Okay and is he working on the anonymization?",
            "Last time he sent me something, then he er developed it somehow. So I don't know.",
            "Yeah, so that is important, because it's the time is, harsh. We really need to have quite a bit of the data available in January. And all the data that we want available in March. But between that, we need to show it to the people for the second round of consents. So this is very, very important, so that we give people some time to browse the data.",
            "Yes, I will write him.",
            "Yeah, so that's like be in touch with him, and he should have access to all the data that we have transcribed. So it's so far the data has been processed only by you and your people. So you were giving it to the people, and you knew what is in which state. But now the data also has to go to the anonymisation. And that should be done as benchwise -",
            "Yeah.",
            "As possible. So that the same style of anonymisation is applied everywhere.",
            "I know already. He sent me something about three weeks ago.",
            "Of extracted named entities.",
            "And today he said he had some discussion with you, and he understood that he should change it somehow. And I make it better.",
            "Today? He said that?",
            "No, no, no. Three weeks ago.",
            "Three weeks ago. Yeah yeah, okay.",
            "And that sh he would send another table and probably sent. I should check it, probably.",
            "Okay, so I have shared the evaluation metrics that was run on one of our like dry run minuting data. And so basically, we have now like lots of evaluation metrics from which we can choose.",
            "Yeah. So and there are lots of results. If if I was preparing the other documents, which would look better. It is some kind of messy now. Because there is so much information right here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm not -",
            "But - One thing which PERSON3 I came across was that we don't have anything called as gold standard. So everyone in the building automatic metric, they have something called as go comparing their generated minutes with the gold standard minutes.",
            "So possibly for, like, preparing our own - If you, if you talk about preparing our own automatic metric. We have to see to something which is without reference. Which is like without gold reference.",
            "So that's what I had in my mind that because we don't have anything which is gold standard. And oh, it is all made by annotators. So if we can consider any of them gold standard.",
            "Yes, that's what we can do. So we can split, and we have to do that anyway. We have to have the meetings split into the training part, the development part and the, and the final test part. And, this is something that has to be done, like immediately after we have the data anonymized. And then the gold standard is available for all the training data and for the development set. And we will have it, or we have it, but we will not disclose it for that as well. So that's the gold standard. We will choose if we have more meetings more minutes for a single meeting, we will choose just one. Or we can even have two gold standard. That that's also OK. There can be multi reference metrics. So -",
            "So that means the one which originated by anotators is the gold standard one?",
            "Yes, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I thought, yeah, PERSON7, please go ahead.",
            "Yes, so like all these metrics are well and fine running, although I must say I don't know much about them. I look few like I've started writing a doc about the discussion of each of them after reading the papers. So but these are all running, so -",
            "Okay.",
            "Any of them, we can like choose, yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's great.",
            "So so there are some semantic level metrics, like bird score and sentence mover similarity. So that was also there in the proposal, like we keep at least two lexical and two semantic level metric.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that we can just do submission from both end. So yes, so this is very messy, but I will prepare the like the? set of metrics like from the roots. We can just take the roots position for one, two, three, and then also we can see the dataset metric. Where there are many other metrics, like overage, a density compassion ratio. So we don't need all of them. I will prepare at least like those which are easily understandable from this.",
            "And I will I will I will send it to you with my comments.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So one thing that I noticed, one thing that I noticed is like we took minute five, like in the dry event that minute five was the best performing one. Like according to all of us. And then and then it was meeting two, I guess. Sorry meeting one and two. So you can also see that, usually for these two minutes, the score is higher.",
            "But the score against what? What is for the scores are reference based.",
            "According to the minute, minute five.",
            "Okay, so you take minute you take minute five as the gold standard. And then, like you meassure minute one and minute two against a minute five.",
            "Yes, yes, so I did it for all the minutes, yeah.",
            "That is usually, so I consider that other minutes are like submitted by our participants. And minute five result is the gold standard we have.",
            "We will trully know which of the methods work best when we have the true submissions. So you can now use the that's what PERSON6 mentioned. So PERSON6, which of the summarization methods you have implemented. Can you run them?",
            "Yeah, so can I share my screen. I think I have opened? I did on my machine.",
            "I just start.",
            "I need to allow everybody to share their screen so that. How do I get away of this chat. PERSON6, may closed. PERSON6 guest may closed.",
            "Hello.",
            "And you need to mute yourself on one of the two devices. Yeah, okay.",
            "So what we are currently also doing is that we are doing the same? evaluation of two other meetings.",
            "And we have created the minutes, and I'm still? behind it one of those, but I will do this by weekend. And then I will also like put the evaluation of all these three in one doc.",
            "It would be easier for us to understand that what is a general train for the metric.",
            "Yeah, so - So can you start wrapping of lines in this editor? Or maybe, so PERSON6, can you exit this and open in VI instead? Or this control ex. PERSON6, hello. PERSON6, can you hear me? Hey PERSON6. She is sharing and she doesn't hear anything.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "You heard twice. So you need to mute you need to turn off the speakers, on the on machine, yes. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "So now that's good your machine, your desktop will provide the screen and your Iphone will provide the sound.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Can you please can you please close this in nano and instead open it in less? Or VI or VIM? VIM.",
            "I usually use nano.",
            "I'll tell you how exit VIM.",
            "Okay, it is a long time when I used to use VIM.",
            "You really should take use VIM. Because now you will you will learn immediately that, for example, the outputs contain this bite or their mark, this F, E, F, F. So VIM reveals much more about the, the text files then the nano.",
            "Yes.",
            "So it's different, because then less of mess is left accidentally in the files. So, yes, what can I see. Hello everybody, hi good morning.",
            "Another language. Oh, so this is for the whole for how long was the original session?",
            "Can I open that meeting? I think I have it on my desktop. Just a second. Yeah, this is the meeting. Here we have -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it was one hour long.",
            "Oh, and it produced these short summaries.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then obviously a lot of content is, is lost? It's not it's not in the summary.",
            "Yes. So at least I think that's better than the like it's like baseline like better than extracting some. So this is actually extracting. So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We cannot expect much to, but still the highest probability sentences are not good, like they are not important to us.",
            "Yeah, not important.",
            "Yes, this is PERSON3 from the paper recent ORGANIZATION3 paper.",
            "And ATM net and so this is this is something I've just implemented that paper.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON6 is it -",
            "And the paper -",
            "A superb?",
            "No no.",
            "So does the paper also provide their code or they don't provide the code.",
            "You had to implement it yourself?",
            "Yes.",
            "So could you also please get in touch with the authors of the paper. Just send them an email and say, I would like to test your system on our summaries.",
            "And I re-implemented but I would like to double check if I got it right. So either that they send you their input data so that you run it. And you compare the outputs with their outputs. Or that like but this is because this is non not anonymised yet. That you would do like a test probe with only one of the meetings. And carefully select one which contains only the project internal people. Ideally only us, then and send it to them so that they run it. And the question is whether your implementation delivers the same results as their implementation.",
            "And it's it's very unlikely that it will be the same outputs actually. So by this contact, you will first validate whether your implementation is correct. And second, you will kind of tell them, and in halfway invite them for the shared task as well. So this is also like a side goal that I have there.",
            "So please contact them for sure and try to use that because they are now actively working in the field. So hopefully they will they will see how difficult our data is. And and what do you. What they can do with that.",
            "So they have actually one person, I think that is a PhD student. And he is working he has lots of papers into meeting summarization.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So I think we can -",
            "We'll definitely.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So just keep me in the copy and yeah. So that's it's very common that you learn a lot by replicating trying to replicate someone's paper. And and vice versa, like he learns a lot about his own paper when, when someone replicates it. Because there are many decisions that are never written in the paper. And you made them and he or she has made them differently. So by it's it's also like sometimes you get a better score by the bugs that you have in your code. And sometimes you get a worse score b.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it's it's important two very useful to have two implementations and compare their outputs, and then discover the bugs in each of the implementations. Yeah, I'm sorry I'll have to leave for the other meeting now. But, well, you can continue discussing. I think, we are all said, so, this is this is good. We have something. It is not doing the summarization as we want, but it is doing something. So p yeah, please working on that. I s I nice to see PERSON4 here even with the family.",
            "So, so please make sure that we make a timeline for the data preparation and share it with PERSON10. So that and PERSON7 so that like for every file we know by when it should be processed to what level. So that for every file or every set of files, we know by when it should be processed to what level. And that we can check whether we are on track. So the timeline is very important. So some files which are still without the transcripts, they will probably not make it to the release. Some files which already do have transcript, but are not anonymised they should get it get in there. So please add columns.",
            "So it's not a pro. So it's quite clear result.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's unclear for me at the moment with the dates. So we should either set it with PERSON7 I think -",
            "Yes. Make a timeline.",
            "And how many steps? So what are the steps?",
            "Yeah. Anonymise -",
            "What is not clear for me at the moment.",
            "Anonymise, with PERSON7 and PERSON10. Anonymise with the help of annotators. And then show for the second consent.",
            "So once it should go through some PERSON10 programme and then get back to me. And I should give it back to annotators.",
            "Kind of, yes. But discussed the details with PERSON10. It's not, straightforward. Because it's -",
            "So it's -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It seems to be q big way to go. And once more we already have quite a lot of alignments. But? rather discuss it with PERSON7 later.",
            "Yes, so the alignments are like they're useful for the evaluation. They are not so important for the anonymization. But for the release -",
            "Yes. So they're the alignments are less important for the participants. They're less important for the for the January and March release. Yes, for this tasks they are not, yeah.",
            "Yes but we need the data sooner so we need to anonymise and publish them in time.",
            "Yes, so we do not release at all any alignments. They will we will just use it for evaluation.",
            "If we have them, it's better, it's nicer to release them.",
            "Okay. It's not so that's not decided now. It's rather -",
            "Yeah. Okay, yeah. So great. Thanks for talking to you and now I'll now make PERSON4 the -",
            "I think we can finish now just -",
            "Well -",
            "PERSON3 disappears.",
            "I think PERSON3.",
            "He's just disappeared.",
            "So that was a mistake. Sorry, I did not. I didn't mean to disappear.",
            "So is some of you, the host?",
            "I think we can finish it. Just say good by and -",
            "Yeah, s-well but discuss with PERSON7 and PERSON10 as well. So yes, thank bye.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Okay, bye."
