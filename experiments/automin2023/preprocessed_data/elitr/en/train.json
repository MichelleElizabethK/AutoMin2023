            "Hi everyone.",
            "Hi.",
            "Yeah, great. Thanks for joining and,, yeah okay. So, yeah. I I see that people have written up what they did.",
            "Hi PERSON13, I can hear you.",
            "Yep, that's great. And also you were evaluating. Yes, so that's that's re re record. What you did. So what I have,, on my mind now is,, well,, preparations. So,, PERSON13, I am busy,, with the IW SLT,, write-up. That was the,, the wra last part that I did. Now busy with interviewing people people to to replace those who are moving forward so to say. So there is number of colleagues on projects that I am supervising,, that who are going for studies abroad and other things. So,, what I think we should focus on is the demo for Project Officer. Then we need to focus on the ladder climbing,, which is building,, PROJECT3 test set plus,, regularly,, testing on it. And, what else,, the deliverables. Yeah. PROJECT3 deliverables. So, I'll try to provide the links. Or those who of you, who are already working on the deliverables, please mention that. And yeah. Let's let's go quickly over what what have done. So PERSON6 you are the first on the list. So please briefly update what what you have been working on. And what what is the plan for the next week.",
            "So, luckily. Not luckily but this week I had like quite less tasks to do. So first I calculated the word error rate on Czech transcripts using that three versions of,, Czech ASR which PERSON10 created. And so yesterday PERSON10 told me that they were,, and the golden transcript and its corresponding video there were there were huge huge mismatch. And I and he said to update me. And then we conducted a few testing sessions with PERSON11 and PERSON18. And they were not quite successful because the segmenters from,,, ORGANIZATION1 they were still down and PERSON12 today he is he is working on them.",
            "And lastly yeah I think I did. It was the input in the PROJECT3 deliverable of for the punctuator and through caser.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I don't have. I think that apart from the testing sessions to do this week so I am waiting for new tasks.",
            "Yeah, so. So the word error rate, there is also the English,, transcripts? And also we should have from PERSON9 the German one, right? So.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So, so I will make it to do.",
            "So I have updated the German transcripts in its corresponding path and like do we have the golden transcripts for the English videos?",
            "Yes, that's the other part. Because this is the consecutively translated videos. So there is always the English speaker and then the Czech speaker who repeats the same content. And PERSON7 has split the video and while the English part should be more reliable,, the Czech part has been done simply by using the other ends. So the Czech video has been cut using the English time stamps. Like the end of English and the beginning of the next English segment. So it's like like interleave the the the other way round. So that's why I'm not surprised that the Czech video is,, imprecise in timing. But still, I was not expecting it to be that bad. So,, that is something that, yeah. PERSON10, can you maybe tell us more details about that?",
            "Yeah, yeah. Well, I just like listened to the audio and followed the talk transcript. And it was completely off. I think it is. There must be some miss-match because.",
            "Yeah, yeah. The transcription is for the completely different audio than it's in the subdirectory.",
            "Oh, so then someone must have like messed it up.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I I may maybe it's just like. Maybe the files are just switched between the subdirectories?",
            "I I haven't checked but. Yeah, there is some some serious mismatch there.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON10 can you coul could you do this check? It should not be hard. Like try listening to all the files that are within this demo for PERSON15,, and try to locate the correct file, the appropriate files. But we should have, we should have the transcripts ready for all of those. So we should be able to,, to evaluate it. And also for the English ones we have the translations. So for the English ones PERSON6,, I would like you to evaluate not only the word error rate of the ASR. But also the machine translation quality or at the SLT even. With the translation quality into German and Czech. Both are available.",
            "Okay.",
            "We have these files ready.",
            "And so these, for like a German audio and English PROJECT1.",
            "English,, input for English sound. We have the golden English transcript, so you can check the ASR. And we also have the translation into Czech and into German. So you can also evaluate directly the translation quality,, of that.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so this is, this is an important,, task,, to do, wr also for German and English audios. And another to do,, bleu or SLTF,, for,, German and Czech translations of,, English.",
            "ASR.",
            "Audio input. Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. And with the, with this testing sessions, so when will we have some successful or like reliable,, testing sessions? Did PERSON11 say or PERSON12 say anything about the the new date?",
            "So, like yesterday there was a holiday in Germany.",
            "So, like they didn't work at all. And today PERSON12 was working in the morning and I don't have any updates from PERSON12 what. The status of. From them. But yeah, to today PERSON12 was doing the fixings of the segmenter.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, please also check the timing. Like, when they would be available. When do ORGANIZATION1 plus ORGANIZATION6 expect,,,, reliable run. Including the segmenter. Yeah. So then,, yeah the. You had provided some input in the delive PROJECT3 deliverable, right? So I need to review that. Yeah, that's good.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay.",
            "And I had another idea and that was, yeah. So that's,, my question like backing up of our systems into net data PROJECT3 systems. Have you done anything about that? So that we have a full back-up of all the systems?",
            "Me?",
            "Yeah, including you.",
            "Yes, I I I have already did everything.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "That. I have also did today some systems. That have been created. And I also did last week. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. That's that's good. So another thing is finding another partner,, who would run the replicates the replicas of our systems. So imagine that it's us who are without connectivity. So we need to have someone to to replace us as,, -. Like we are now able to run systems from ORGANIZATION1, someone. We need to pick someone,, who will be happy to run systems for ourselves. So,, PERSON13 suggest ORGANIZATION2 to run our PROJECT1 models but,,, but please check with PERSON8 later on and,. So PERSON13 suggests ORGANIZATION2 to run our our PROJECT1 models, ORGANIZATION1 to run our PROJECT2 models, probably. And who well and someone to run our segmenters, yeah. So, so we need to pick someone. So, so if you could. When you are in touch with these,, please talk to them and,, let me know. Because on Thursday we have PROJECT3 call and for that call I would actually like to know if we have a substitute site for each of our systems. So,, so to od check with others,, tell me before tomm Thursday call so I know if we have a substitute for each of our systems.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you. So there is lot of work to do on the evaluation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the I would like really very soon to see some numbers that we trust. So obviously there is this problem with the Czech. And now hopefully there will not be other problems with with the other thing,, other things. And this. Yeah.",
            "What I believe with the Czech transcripts was that is that PERSON7 probably might have,. We need to ask him the audio which he used to transcribe the the videos.",
            "I mean, he must have received some audio by which, after which he he has written those transcripts manually.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and maybe that's not the real audio which he has repla he has placed in the directory.",
            "Yes, so that the the. This is for someone who can understand Czech obviously to,, to find out. But the the audio input,, that the transcript corresponds to, that is the audio which has been released as the IWSLT test set. So anyone can,, can easily check the IWSLT test set.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So thanks, thanks for this. Now for PERSON19. You have been working hard like very hard on the evaluation of the PROJECT1 and ASR submissions for the IWSLT last week. And these days,, what you are working on PERSON19? If you can still hear us.",
            "Yes, I can hear you. Hello. PERSON13.",
            "I can hear you.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "This week I have been working on IWSLT submissions files again.",
            "But there is a problem about calculating the bleu score.",
            "As I've sent you in the email. I think we need a good tokeniser. We have two ways. We can ready to use tokeniser us as and so on.",
            "And another problem calculating the bleu score. I have used the NLTK model for calculating the scores.",
            "So we have discussed this. So we have discussed the NLTK versus SacreBLEU with PERSON2. And we do not trust the NLTK bleu score at all. Because it is probably not tokenising and also accidentally it is. It drops to 0. So it is. It can be both, inflated and and too small. So we don't trust NLTK bleu scores at all. We trust only Sacre-BLEU. And I think they're like. Please write. Oh you have. Or you have sent me an email on this? I will double check. Well, SLTF thank you for the organisation. See you later. SLT system mapping. So I don't see any email there. No.",
            "If you want, I can resend it again.",
            "Space tokeniser. Yes, so es essentially to answer your question in the email. We have to switch to and we have for the IWSLT. We have to switch to SacreBLEU and SacreBLEU does its own tokenisation before scoring. So there is no. Let's let's simply forget NLTK bleu score. That is not reliable.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "Yes, but we can combine our tokeniser with NLTK.",
            "Uf. Let's not do that. Let's just forget it. Let's let's just use SacreBLEU.",
            "Okay.",
            "I I have one comment about it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You sh should use tokeniser before enverse segmenter.",
            "Yes, that's it. Yeah.",
            "Because it's much better. Because it can rely on the on the dots and commas and question marks and so on. And you can you can check my script which does tokeniser, enverse segmenter and then de-tokeniser. And here is the path in the document. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And it's it's using the Moses seg tokeniser and detokeniser. And it needs the the language tag as the first argument and then reference.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON19, do you do you fo? Do you understand?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the problem is that enverse segmenter is not reliable if you run it on non-tokenised text. It is much better to tokenise it before enverse segmenter and then maybe undo the tokenisation again. And this is,, what PERSON18's script does. So I would like you incorporate this logic into SLTF. So that the SLTF will run the tokenisation, then enverse segmenter, then again re reconstruct the original tokenisation. Which is not the same thing as removing tokenisation. I really would like to reconstruct the original one. And then,, calculate,, the SacreBLEU score. Which includes its own tokenisation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, I understand.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "By by the way. The enverse segmenter is still quite bad tool. Sometimes it fails without without reason on some scripts. And we found out with PERSON17, that if we run it without tokenisation then it works. But with tokenisation it fo it like folds.",
            "Oh.",
            "Yeah, so it is better reliable with tokenisation but it's not 100 percent.",
            "Robust. And we can't do anything with that. Except of,, re-implementing enverse segmenter.",
            "Yeah..",
            "From scratch.",
            "Which. Which we don't have the source code of. It's a. I think it's a. When it comes from ORGANIZATION8, it usually comes without a source code. So.",
            "Yeah. Yes, but there is a paper at least. So.",
            "Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "It's written.",
            "Yeah, yeah okay. So, well. Incorporate logic into SLTF,, to run enverse segmenter,, better,, include,, very paranoic tests,, of or paranoid paranoid parano I don't know the right spelling. Parano I think paranoid is the right. Test of, amber segmenter output. Yeah, okay. So that's. I think that's a a like an important exercise for task for you PERSON19. And.",
            "But PERSON13 you need to,, you need to implement that or that this tokeniser in the first level of our work. Because we use,, the,, can't use this this enverser, we need it run all section of SLT view.",
            "I don't understand. Partly, partly because the network is is bad. So maybe if you can write it down to the ORGANIZATION4 document. And I'll, I'll get back to it. If I understood correctly, you're you are saying that,, there there is some like organisation issue with amber segmenter. The sequence of of operations. Yeah. Cannot see tokenising in all. Oh, you don't have to use. No no no. No. This is, this is only your,, your thinking. There is no,,, it's like it's your design within SLTF that you proceed with an error rate of words. But you don't have to. There is. It's it's just like your design decision of SLTF. And it's a risky decision, because the tokeniations vary. So,,, I think it's better to operate on the level of sentences and tokenise them for a purpose. Such as,, LS,, run SL. Such as running amber segmenter. But then, you should again untokenise. So,, think again. Like do high level thinking about SLTF. And I would like you to avoid,, this forceful tokenisation when we are not quite sure about it. So tokenisation is a peculiar thing. It it affects many many things. And you should always do it for a particular purpose and then revert back to the original tokenisation as as much as possible.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "Oh. I see myself editing this. How is that possible. Who is using my log-in? That's probably PERSON6, yeah.",
            "I see in the PROJECT3 laptop it's. You have been logged-in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I don't know. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "I have logged-in now.",
            "Yeah. So let's. Thank you PERSON19. So please,,,. Yes, that was PERSON19's question. Actually PERSON19 please write down the new assignment. How the tokenisation should be handled. And write it down so that you know for the record. Write down what I've just described so I know that that you understood as well. Yeah. Okay. And while you are writing let's move to PERSON17. I don't see PERSON17 in the call. So he is busy with preparation for exam. Reading or shortening. Yes, his,. Yeah, yeah. So,, PERSON17, PERSON17's goal now is to train PROJECT1 systems so that they reduce the length of the output. And this is like. He is only reading papers now. But he'll he'll start experimenting soon. And PERSON18 is suggesting something great. Okay, that's good. So PERSON19, I don't see you writing. Please write down,, what write down the the new ideal handling of tokenisation in SLTF.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will.",
            "Okay. And we can move to PERSON18. So you have read some ACL papers, wrote,, parts of the SLT deliverable. That's good. Just a quick check with PERSON10. PERSON10 you have also written the the deliverable parts, right? The ASR?",
            "Yeah, yeah, I I wrote into the ASR deliverables.",
            "Yes, so I need to review these and the internal deadline is in 6 days from now. So, hopefully I will get back to all of you. To each of you independently towards the end of the week if there is anything unclear. So that we meet the internal deadline on the 8th. Yeah, okay. Great. So PERSON18, what what is your progress?",
            "Hmhm. Yes, and by reading the papers I found an interesting tool.",
            "I found out that it's possible to measure out the speech rate by cutting the syllables. And there is one tool. One patent tool, which can detect the gender of speaker and the speech rate.",
            "And some other characteristics. So we can try it and make a dashboard out of it.",
            "That's that's useful thing. And later on we could even create models like. If we if we recognise that someone is speaking too fast, we could use like a harsher summarisation.",
            "Yes.",
            "So we could be reducing reducing their speech mole with a different model.",
            "Yes, and there was also speech modes. Like whether it was angry or normal and so on.",
            "But I have no idea how the tool works in practice. I I I I saw it only in Gi GitHub and I buy it.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Actually I'd like to say here. So this is about a I think emotion detection used in speech. So this is basically my bachelor's thesis.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and I worked on this. And I noticed. And I just used MatLab.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON18, please mention the the name of the tool here. Because I don't see that yet.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. And. And PERSON6, since you have the expertise in this, please check the tool. So before.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Be before you leave. Like I d. I'm afraid that. Maybe over the summer, over the summer you could like,,, integrate this tool into into our processes. But even if you don't manage this in time, it would be good to have to have an idea whether it's worth trying that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.",
            "And then, and then to do for PERSON6. To do for PERSON6,, PERSON6 to review it,, and,, possibly integrate it over the summer. But obviously more important is to have the clean the clean cruise control, or, the set-up the set-up script over the summer. Yeah.",
            "Yes. And I I think that the Czech segmenter. So PERSON6 can you mute?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So so it uses the right context for previous sentences. And I did I did back end text. New entry point from the back end ASR which does basically the same but for text. And now it now the segmenter can receive 1 message and emit 2 messages. And and I connected it with on-line text flow and it works. And I had a call with PERSON5. He explained me some things so I can easier fix some bugs, which we found.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we have to do the video for IWSLT by June the 17th.",
            "Yeah, which is quite soon as well.",
            "Yeah so I'm really afraid to manage. Or if anyone is willing to,, come in. And demo the system. I'll I'll start the pipeline everything and if anyone is available to,, demo the system, then.",
            "You mean for the video?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah for the video. I mean.",
            "That could be, that could be interesting, yes. I think that's a.",
            "I'm talking about the system.",
            "Yeah. That's actually a good idea. So when. I don't know for how long the presentation should be. So PERSON18, please like propose timing for for this. I don't know whether we do like regular,,, se regular slides with a with voice commentary? But, we could also indeed concatenate it with the demo session,, of of the whole system. And I think it would be pretty good to illustrate it how it runs live.",
            "It should be 15 minutes presentation.",
            "So if we en editioned. If if within these 15 minutes, we have 2 minute of the 3 minute video from,, the Czech into English and other languages I think that would be very good. So it's. That's a different. Actually so hmhhm. I think. Yeah, we should we should actually demo the,, the task that was in IWSLT.So some of the Antrecorp horrible performing video,, like horrible performing speech. And also the document that PERSON6 is now measuring the word error rate and SLTF on. That's exactly the test file. So that's the preparation for the demo session. Is. Could could be then recorded as well and used as a part of this IWSLT presentation. So I would go for like 2 minutes,, or 3 minutes from the 15 minute,,, talk. And 1 minute of,, one of the Antrecorp videos. Like the horrible hard hard input and some reasonable input. That works reasonably well. So this is. That's that's a great idea. And PERSON6 for you it's it's nothing different from preparing the videos for the demo. The only different thing is that you would also run it on the on the Antrecorp,,, speech.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So maybe PERSON18, you have the scores for all the files, right? So pick some file of Antrecorp,, which,, like,, works probably well. The the best of Antrecorp. But it's pretty bad. All of all of them are pretty bad I believe.",
            "No, I don't have the document scores. I have only your findings paper.",
            "Okay. Yeah, I see.",
            "And validation error, only 2 documents.",
            "That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So,, yeah, will include one horrible Antrecorp, yeah. So this is actually a to do for,, PERSON19. Provide ASR,, so WR scores for PERSON18's runs,, of all Antrecorp files. So PERSON19,, are you here?",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is, this is a sub-set of the lines in the output TSV file. So, if you can select the appropriate lines of that output TSV file and,, and then send it to,, PERSON18 and me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That that would be. That would help.",
            "Only for ASR?",
            "I think that the ASR is so much influencing the translation quality that it's okay to go with AS the word error rate. And then we'll choose based on the word error rate and we'll kind of assume that the translation quality is,, is equal across the different ASR,, qualities. But the ASR quality is is the killing factor.",
            "I I will send you for.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so and now.",
            "Can you, PERSON6 can you can you mute yourself? Yeah. There is some. Your, I think your microphone is is very sensitive. For some reason,, maybe check the input,, again like in in Windows setting. So sorry, what were you saying PERSON19?",
            "Please check my PERSON19 section. Yeah, so this this file, right? Yeah thi this part, right?",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "Yeah, I'll check that in a lli like soon. Thank you. Let's let's move to PERSON10 quickly. So PERSON10, you have been obviously working on your thesis. Submitting thesis,, and then,, wrote a parts. So PERSON10, are you here?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm.",
            "Yes, so so.",
            "So so basically I I have been mainly actually playing with the PROJECT2 server. So I don't know if it would be useful for us. Like for the emission translation or the segmentation, but for some of my experiments I've done that now if like the output gets updated much faster.",
            "So now it was like once per second. And now it's like ten times per second, so yes, so it's updating much faster and second thing that I put there is that we can get a board level time stamps.",
            "For each of the word in the current hypothesis,, because. Right now, it was just the beginning of the whole current path and the end time stamps. But now,, there is like some additional functionality that it can output like the word level time stamps. So I'm I'm not sure if if it would be helpful.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So so I would like to have this set-up which does not rely on mediator. And for that this TCP PROJECT2 server is useful but for the mediator set-up we have the PROJECT2 server by PERSON18. So,, maybe it would be good if you,, get in touch with PERSON18,, and if the features that you have now found in PROJECT2 server, the TCP PROJECT2 server were were also made available if it's not too hard in the like PROJECT2 worker. Would that make sence PERSON18? I don't know how,, or well please talk directly. PERSON10 and PERSON18 should talk about this and figure out how much work would it,, would it involve.",
            "Are changes that I've do I've put directly into the like binary of the TCP server.",
            "Okay, so maybe the same changes could be done within the PROJECT2 worker. So.",
            "Yes. I'm I'm I'm not actually sure ho how the worker exactly works. But.",
            "Yeah. Talk to.",
            "The wor the worker only resends what it receives from PROJECT2.",
            "So it. But I I think it uses the PROJECT2 binary, the TCP server, right?",
            "Yes. You gave us some shell scripts which starts the TCP server on some ports and it connects to this ports.",
            "Yes, so so these changes I have done are inside this binary.",
            "So it should be easy.",
            "So there is like the option if we, if we find useful space for it then we can get word level time stamps for the real time recording.",
            "Yes, I would like to have them.",
            "Much faster updating the.",
            "Yeah, I w I would like to have the word level time stamps in the,, in the log files. So this is for PERSON6 actually. So that the log files are very verbose. I'd like to have that,,, as well. So,, to do for PERSON6. Make sure that our log files include this word level time stamps. Okay, so thank you.",
            "So when.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So what level time stamps of the ASR output of PROJECT2 ASR?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "For the real time recognition.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "So this is, this is what is then useful for SLTF for the evaluation of the simultaneity. Of of the speech. So when we know which word as when, recognised when, we can link it and,, score it against the golden transcript.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So so I will. I have like copy of the original TCP server that I've modified so I can do like launch PROJECT2 script. Deleted 18 lines. So PERSON3 what what is your progress? Are you here? No, I'm not sure. We don't hear you.",
            "Hello?",
            "Yeah, yeah it works. Okay.",
            "Okay. Hi, so I have collected,, Georgian and what is the name gave me. Because in the last meeting we discussed like remaining languages like Georgian and Hebrew and. And another language,.",
            "Icelandic.",
            "Icelandic, yes so it is collected and I will upload today. This data. And all the files I've already sent Russian, Serbian and what is the name. Croatian. PERSON14 PERSON14 what was the file name yeah Danish. Yeah today I sent Danish file to PERSON14 for validation. As we discussed. As in the last meeting we discussed, okay, if she can do like any like similar closer languages validation. So I had a conversation with PERSON14 and she agreed for Danish and Dutch.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I just sent Danish and remaining Russian text data I've sent it has sent it to PERSON1 for the validation.",
            "Yeah okay.",
            "So I don't know how many is. And okay, that is working. So just I received, 15 or 20 minute before I received PERSON7 email for remaining annotators so I will send all the annotators all the files. But regarding the Norwegian we didn't receive any response from the e PERSON4 PERSON4 sorry I don't know what is the actually PERSON4 by PERSON4. The response. And I sent it in 30th April 3000 sentences but we didn't receive any response. I remain. I sent 2 reminders but I don't know. Maybe she is.",
            "Okay.",
            "Busy in another work.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's that's bad. Well this can obviously happen. So we have to like come-up with backup solutions and and ask people if they,. Yes, it's it's possible that like. Because we were,, not providing the input quickly enough,, that she got busy with other things. It's it's possible.",
            "She has, maybe it's possible. I have.",
            "I don't know.",
            "So I've asked PERSON16 if we have any other annotator. So because I've already shared some,, annotator list which was created by PERSON6 I think. ORGANIZATION5 language map. So I have already shared if you agree on that unle annotator so we can send all the files for validations. So once the validation is done, so we can merge like tester. We can create new tester directory and where we will put all the multilingual or parallel data equivalent.",
            "Yeah. Otherwise it will create. Again it will create problem like we count sentence alignment and so it's different status so.",
            "Yeah, yeah."

            "Hi.",
            "PERSON9 some big news?",
            "Yes. Probably.",
            "Sorry.",
            "So, z yeah. Great.",
            "Great. So, basically, for today. Can you hear me, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So, so we've had the call last week and I think one important. Well, first of all, PERSON9 officially started working with us, so so let's welcome him, even though we already know him from previous calls. And yeah. He wi he will do mainly ORGANIZATION5 at uhm-PROJECT4 specific implementations and and he will probably help out with n-best list navigation mainly. And PERSON7 has some plans with for him for PROJECT2 too, but that's between PERSON9 and PERSON7, I guess. So. Related to call last week. First of all, I asked PERSON10 whether we would be are expected to have integration for the n-best list navigation. And so far, it seems that we should expect that we will be required to actually provide at least some prototype. So in practice, it seems that we will probably show our current prototype or maybe some modification of it to the user interfacting and they will try to implement into the final product. I will. Well, this is mostly PERSON11 related, so I will not go into more details about this, because I think it's still we are still ahead of time with this one. So, what else. There was some some mention of the PROJECT7 integration. And I'm not sure what's the current status. But I think the user interface team should have implemented it, right? Like, just in case someone has more detailed news about this?",
            "Sorry, about PROJECT7 integration, or about the experiment?",
            "Pst, no no no, I'm ta I'm talking about the integration and and basically, PERSON10 was. Well. PERSON10 wanted it implemented by the end of last month, or maybe two months ago. But I I didn't notice any conversation about it.",
            "So I take it that it's been done. Because of what's supposed to be done.",
            "Okay. I hope so. Yeah, we we just.",
            "Yeah, like. This this was when our -",
            "We just, we just. The. Suggested or like we offered our help.",
            "If they need like. So so yeah. We decided, or or they decided that only back translation will be implemented in this like pile of integration.",
            "And we offered our help and nobody asked us for for for our help, so I hope everything went smoothly.",
            "Yeah, I I have the same opinion. Like I think did not tell us that we should do it. And and I think it was quite clear that, so.",
            "Yeah. I think I think thus far as some integration is concerned, I think we're fine now, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Let's not worry about that.",
            "Yeah, I agree, let's not worry about it at the moment. At the same time. So this in Czech, we call this strategy of of the dead beetle. So.",
            "Let's play the dead beetle strategy on this. Because we assume that it has been properly picked up and they do what they needed with that. At the same time, at the back of our heads, we should like have this little worry. That at any point, suddenly, they can jump on us and and realize oh, we forgot to pick this up and it was never actually degraded in any way. And you would have to record what you send to them. So. Don't don't fully take it as delivered, until it has been picked up by them. But that's let's not worry, I totally agree.",
            "Yeah, I think. I'm I'm taking a note, then I think if I ask about it on the next call, it should be fine. Just again, like we we have lot of time, ahead of us. So so if we catch it now, it should be completely fine.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. PERSON11 mentioned that the the n-best list navigation sh will probably not be easy to integrate into PROJECT7. So that's another thing I will probably ask, can I next time. Whether it's fine to deliver it as a separate prototype module or something. I'm I'm not actually up to date with the current implementation of the of the browser translator. So since I don't know the details, I'm not sure I can which way we we can do that, but again, like we we can discuss it with the on the on the next call. With the others. But it would be good to have.",
            "I mean, can I ask?",
            "So, a general idea.",
            "Is is there any incentive to have this in PROJECT7? Because PROJECT7 was a very specific, like.",
            "No, no, no, no, no. The the, my idea was that let's let's have this single module that can have all this functionality. It it cannot even, it. Like technically, it would be alright if it was just separate option for the PROJECT7 or something. Like it wouldn't be related to PROJECT7 at all, but it would be at least in the single.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Instance, right? Yes, that that kind of thing, so so we have something that can look into. And like okay, now you can try PROJECT7, now you can try the navigation. It, this is basically for the presentation purposes mainly.",
            "Huh, I see.",
            "Like.",
            "Well, it's absolutely easy to like develop it within TNT and then just paste it into PROJECT7.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. This this should be fine as a as a initial solution, if if they do not want. Like, again. We we can show it to PERSON10 and if he's fine with it, we're fine. And otherwise, we can we can think about something else. The. I was not thinking about something more complex or anything more complex, so. So it's good to know that this at least this is doable and it probably should not be much work, right? Okay, that's great. That's good for now. Okay. So PROJECT7 is advancing, right? Little bit?",
            "Yeah, I would like to ask PERSON4.",
            "What what's the number of segments we actually want to to have. Like currently, we have two times what we had for 2B.",
            "Yes.",
            "I I don't think this enough to get any new significant findings, but you you.",
            "Yeah. I actually haven't estimated what what's like the the best or or or the sufficient number of of segments. Yeah. I can look at it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I -",
            "But we have more like, we have more options. I mean, with the. We have additional empty systems. We definitely need more than twice.",
            "Yeah, that that's that's.",
            "Or or the double, yeah.",
            "Yeah. I would also like to get some more specific timeline, like what we have to do, like what conference are we aiming for? And.",
            "So so. Well, on on Wednesday, or maybe early Thursday, there's a ORGANIZATION3, but I think that's probably out of question.",
            "Okay, we don't have any any. We didn't just. We even did look into the data, so yeah.",
            "Okay, okay. So basically, the next one should be any.",
            "Yeah, any any CL and that's 21st of November, so I'm not sure how much you expect to spend on analyzing, but.",
            "Well.",
            "Yeah?",
            "I I want to suggest. Like it's going to be them or us who's going to analyze it? Or just combinating of both? Because -",
            "We could start analyzing it now and just get more precise data later.",
            "O my original intentions was that they should analyze the thing relate or or the stuff related to user experience. So, if they can extract some information from from the from how much time did they did the user spend on on s like the stimulis and wh yeah. And we should analyze the other things, like related to the translation quality.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. That was my original intentional idea.",
            "Yeah, but the question is whether they will have anyone to work on this at all.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I mean.",
            "So definity definitely ask them. Whether whether they plan to invest some time into the analysis, or like. At least so so we know whether we can expect some results from them, right?",
            "So so we can still live we can still live with the analysis as PERSON11 did them in in our paper for PROJECT8 so it's like.",
            "Well, that that's the problem, because. If I started writing the paper now, then I would just write the same paper. I just need to cooperate with someone or yeah.",
            "Wh what's the like so so we we would have we will have new data, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or the new results, so.",
            "Yeah yeah, that's true, but I would like do the same analysis, or.",
            "Like yeah. I mean the the problem is more like asking the right questions and like answering the graph is easy. But just having to ask, like what's the correlation between the the estimation and the confidence and all that. So I I have time to write it, but I just need to consult with someone.",
            "Okay, so so so.",
            "Yeah okay, so so. Like, yeah I'm free like or willing to consult the things.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that's what I'm saying now, l that the the like the kind of analysis, that you did for the PROJECT8 paper.",
            "It was okay. And I liked it. And so in this way, like. We should.",
            "But there's no sense in writing the same two papers just with slightly different data.",
            "Okay, so we can add some more analysis.",
            "But but the question is like what.",
            "There there definitely there won't be like the same data, because we have additional, additional MT systems. So we can compare this stuff, that how you know.",
            "Quality of the MT system effects, that affects the results.",
            "The the. We have like three MT systems for Czech and the one is that. That is using the PROJECT1 and and is trained on small data. And the other one is using PROJECT1 and it's trained on big data. And the other one is trained on big data and but it's the student one and optimized one for the CPU and it's fast. So we can somehow compare this three systems.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And yeah. So I think, like, there definitely there will be additional content.",
            "Okay, so, I just make up a template from ORGANIZATION7 and start bringing in and then ask you by email.",
            "Yeah and, but we have to. Like, don't forget that we have to ask Estonian, Estonians to.",
            "Assess the translation or evaluate it.",
            "Oh and we have to do that for Czech as well, right?",
            "Yeah. We have to do it for Czech as well.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "So.",
            "So I think this will be again quite a time demanding thing, so. Especially -",
            "So at the. These days we are running like a campaign over a number of tasks, we call it the autumn annotation exercises, or tasks at ORGANIZATION4. And this one was not listed there, because well like it didn't occur to me. But we can probably ask the people who are now s preparing the agreements with PERSON5. I hope we all put also PROJECT5 as as a third option. Source for money for for those short term contracts. And it should be relatively easy to get people to do this evaluation. Well, it's it's definitely easy to contact them and we're not sure how many of them will say yes to one more task.",
            "But.",
            "Yeah, I. Yeah, I.",
            "Yes.",
            "This is happen like, as it was during the like in the springtime. So I'm not afraid about us getting the people for evaluating the stuff for Czech.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I'm again afraid of the other partners and here it is start to.",
            "But I've hea Estonians were like very cooperative. I.",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "If it's only, because he's overloaded. So it's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Make sure to have back-up person.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, but I don't know - They are they are cooperative, but I don't know how many human resour or how much human resources they have. So it can still like. Delay. Somehow.",
            "So we can definitely ask them, right? So to to get some estimate. But.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we can now w. Okay, now we can start like preparing them, f that that the time when they have to, tor they should they should find some human resources to evaluate the translation. So that, when we when we are finished with the annotation, or with the experiment, they are ready to, to run the run the annotation, or the evaluation.",
            "Okay. Maybe, are y are you able to to get the paper together even in like, in case they will not be able to deliver on time? Just to.",
            "In this case, we would like probab postpone the paper.",
            "Because I I don't think we are publish this.",
            "Yeah, because.",
            "And it was be better to have it like, not only for the Czech, but.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For everything.",
            "Okay.",
            "Well the ORGANIZATION7 deadline seems doable, if the Estonians are very responsive.",
            "But we don't need ORGANIZATION7 specifically. Or do we?",
            "Well,, probably not, but why not try it for.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah obviously, but.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So then if, well if we miss ORGANIZATION7, then the next one would be the January PROJECT8, right? So.",
            "Well.",
            "I guess.",
            "I'm not sure whether they.",
            "And they have to.",
            "The same thing -",
            "We have to decide, how many translations you know. Because like the for every stimuli, or stimulus, the like the translati it's a process of like,.",
            "Oh, you want to translate the whole process?",
            "The input and. Yeah and. So we have to, we have to somehow filter out the translations that we want to be assessed.",
            "And.",
            "Well. In the last paper, I just evaluated the last one, like the confront one and not the process.",
            "Okay.",
            "But it would be e interesting to look at the process, but just. Tis. There is ten times more data to annotate and it's not easy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking about the first one and the last one and or the.",
            "Yeah, but but those are just.",
            "First viable?",
            "Yeah.",
            "First viable, yeah. First viable.",
            "Okay, but I guess those are just the details we can discuss via email.",
            "Okay, so that's that. And lastly, PERSON4 has some results for the paraphrase-based augmentation, right? How how.",
            "Yeah, everything is still running.",
            "And. Yeah, so so I tried the experiments with additional monolingual data and like there's. Two like f like very much data of like four hundred million sentence pairs.",
            "And like in this, in this setting, the quality of the two systems will back translat using back translation the system using back translation and system using paraphrases. It's almost the same. So then I tried using like half of the monolingual data, quarter of the monolingual data and so like decreasing the amount of the monolingual data. Because like when using no monolingual data, we have seen that the the system that is using the paraphrases is better.",
            "Than the system using just the back translation. So I just want to like explore where.",
            "So.",
            "How it.",
            "So. How it changes when I'm like decreasing the amount of the monolingual data.",
            "So there's a difference between back translated data and monolingual data. Like because you are back t.",
            "You are back translating the the sentences from the parallel data, right? Also?",
            "Like if you look, if you look to the to the document I like just listed all the data we are using in our experiment.",
            "ORIG is the original CzEng.",
            "So sixty million open English sentence pairs.",
            "Then BT is the back translated version of CzEng. When Czech, all the Czech sentences were back translated to English.",
            "So.",
            "Para.",
            "Those were b just the BT therefore gives you new synthetic source sentences, right? If I'm understanding correctly.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah. It's like.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah yeah, it's like a synthetic version of CzEng.",
            "The other synthetic version of CzEng is PARA, where these back translations to English are made in the way that they are as diverse as possible.",
            "From the original sources.",
            "In CzEng or English sources.",
            "Sorry, that is that is confusing to me. You are, y so it's synthetic on the target side?",
            "On the source side.",
            "On the source side.",
            "Source side.",
            "B in normally, you're training a system which goes from English into Czech, or the other f way around?",
            "This is, this is like the setting for for the training the system from English to Czech.",
            "From English into Czech.",
            "Yes.",
            "So you are creating synthetic English, yep, okay.",
            "Yes.",
            "And you are translating. So the translations are as diverse from the English difference as possible, but still good enough. And how is that measured? How how do you?",
            "This is the system that was designed by PERSON3.",
            "Okay, yep.",
            "I don't know the the details about it, but.",
            "Like PERSON1 just generated.",
            "Okay.",
            "So. The.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Data for this. So like, our assumption or or like the h the way how the system was created suggests that the that the translation should be more like, diverse from the original sources.",
            "I mean from the original English reference in.",
            "And, there are just lot of Czech o like authentic Czech sentences, back translated with that PT system or or just the like or normal back translation to English.",
            "So the experiments were like the first experiment is using just the bilingual data.",
            "In that PT and in a way that we first pretrain on synthetic data and then fine tune on the original. Or the authentic. And the other experiment is when we in in the pretraining phase, we extended the data with the those monolingual data. So there are like we are like instead of using just 60 million sentences, we are using 470 million sentences.",
            "Or sentence pairs. Yeah? And then I'm running the third experiment, is like series of experien. I'm running the same as in the second experiment. But lowering ma lowering the amount of the monolingual data. Yeah? So, now 50 percent, 25 percent, 12.5 percent and 6 percent.",
            "Yeah, and the result, you can see the results in the table. I linked to you. And.",
            "Some of the experience are still running, so or most of the experi like those fraction experie experiments I'm running I'm still running the pretraining phase. But from the pretraining phase, the the scores are very similar in the in both variants.",
            "But yeah. Let's wait for the fine tuning phase. What what will appear.",
            "Okay.",
            "And the main motivation is to have am Czech to English system, which is good for the outbound set up? Or?",
            "Not really. We we somehow diversed from this outbound translation motivation, because.",
            "Like we started from the yeah, we started from the like PROJECT9 translation, but PERSON1, PERSON1's branch of this experiment was about this data augmentation. So using paraphrases for data augmentation in standard machine translation.",
            "Okay.",
            "And so like when we were aiming for PROJECT6 in the mid August, I was doing the PROJECT9 branch and PERSON1 was working on the this augmentation.",
            "And in the mid August, th like this augmentastion branch appeared to be better and promising. More promising that the branch with PROJECT9.",
            "And since PERSON1 was leaving, I also like started to work on this augmentation branch of the experiment.",
            "So now I'm working on it like alone, or like I'm discussing. I just discussed the stuff with PERSON1. And we should probably the second half of of this week, we should have a call about this. But yeah.",
            "So the motivation is.",
            "It is somehow it 'somehow diverged.",
            "From the from the original PROJECT9.",
            "Yeah. So you're just trying to get a better performance by y augmenting source side with paraphrases or back translation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or something else. Huh.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Also.",
            "Yeah with paraphrases. We are we're like we are looking s. So we're exploring whether those paraphrases or or creating back translations in a way that they are the diverse from the original sources. Whether it makes the system better.",
            "Yeah. There is one thing that is worth exploring here. And that is. It's also I think that the experiments that you are doing now are very similar in nature but obviously, you had the paraphrases and that's different. From the PERSON2 does with his concat back translation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you are doing the like transfer. You pretrain on something and then switch once. While PERSON2 has these multiple switches on.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "And when I was mentioning this to to some ORGANIZATION2, they told me that what also works is to just label the input sentences with whether they are from the genuine or the back translated corpus. And then they saw some gains when mixing those in the standard way. So PERSON2 set up has these camel the camel shape. The waves. With the data labeled, you will mix it normally and you would see a steady growth. And hopefully it would grow higher. So I think that you could also for some of the promising set ups, you could also or try it with mixing the different styles of of data. And explicitly labelling that style.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because then the system has the chance to like learn realize that some of the Czech v or no English sentences, the target sentences, are more genuine, some are more translationese and benefit from this distinction.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Thanks for the suggestion. But maybe I I don't want to diverge even more.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",
            "From the original objected then. And as soon as we are finished with this experiment and and somehow ready have a pape have have some results that are ready for paper, for for.",
            "To be published, I want go back to the PROJECT9.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because otherwise.",
            "That is needed.",
            "That is needed.",
            "Yes, this is needed for the project, yeah.",
            "So this is like the baseline. We can see there's a baseline for the for the PROJECT9 in a way. It's different single sources analyzings.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And technically, it's all PROJECT4, right? Any.",
            "Yeah, it's all PROJECT4.",
            "And you run it manually from some directory in or do you have some system to to launch these many experiments?",
            "Not really. Yeah I'm running manually.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because I've yeah. I need to get PROJECT4 again up and running for myself.",
            "Okay.",
            "For some students of mine. So I'll probably ask you later if. Like I'll try. What is the current best set up, best compilation of PROJECT4, how to get it easily running at ORGANIZATION4. You you all now know, because you all all have gone through that. At.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "And.",
            "Yeah, I'm actually using the Jin some of the PERSON1's compilation and yeah. I have to or we have to compile different PROJECT4 for TLL 1 and 8.",
            "Okay.",
            "And different one for other TLLs and yeah. So.",
            "So you use. You manually know which is which and you rely on PERSON1's compilation?",
            "I have like a like a small screep, just deciding what.",
            "What to run where.",
            "Version of of to run. Whether like. Depending on the machine. That it's running on.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Definitely, you can ask PERSON6, because he was dealing with this recently, so he might have some.",
            "But I'm not sure that works.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "So there's that. And also, like if if that's a everything for the PROJECT9, we can talk a little about the n-best list navigation. So PERSON6, you you want to talk, or should I?",
            "I can talk.",
            "No problem. So. We're training module. Y English-Czech module. Using Fairseq, thanks to PERSON11 and all that Fairseq has in implementation of the constraint decoding. So we will use that in our experiments. So, so far, we're still training and the validation shows that we have a a blue score of 27. So it's in it's okay. But we will still going to train for a couple of. And we're going to use the data sets provided by by PERSON7. So yeah. We have a particular one that is 50 sentences, 50 sentences, but many references. So this can be a good one. But I will still we will investigate the best one. And but now we're we are thinking about how we're going to select the constraints. So, we don't want to just select any word from the reference and use it as a constraint. So we are trying to think about ideas to select. I don't know. Informative words, maybe. I I we will have to think about that yet. But PERSON8 told me about the use of word alignment. So we could try to try to check among the references, the words that are different from the other references. Maybe I I I'm not sure yet. But I will investigate. But I d. And what else? Let's say. About.",
            "Maybe maybe maybe. Sorry PERSON6 j. Maybe you could use TFIDF, for all the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "All the variants and see if if anything sensible comes out of that. So first, look if if TFIDF offers some distinguish, essentially distinguish the references from one another.",
            "Perfect. Yah. So I can. So the idea is that we will use these constraints and see how many constraints. It needs to to output the the reference we want and. Thinking in ways that we can test this constraints. But I think that we have some progress and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To have to finetune things, but.",
            "So what I find important is to decide how to compare the different approaches. Because you should always have fixed set of references, for a given comparison. And if you would do the like normal thing, or the most straightforward thing and leave one out, then you could easily end up with something which is not comparable. So I think that you would have to leave three out and then use these three left references as the source of the constraints. And then see how that behaves. But I I I haven't thought about the set up carefully. But I just wanted to warn you that the set of references has to be fixed for the or any other scorce to be comparable.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "So we still haven't discussed whether we will focus on the on the positive or negative constraints, right? Or PERSON6 have you have you thought about it, which one would you.",
            "I think the positive constraints would be.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "The positive one. The positive one is telling the system which word needs to be outputed, right?",
            "Yeah, perfect.",
            "Yeah. And we get the positive ones from the references. Because if the reference has it, then it's probably good word to to to use it. So.",
            "Because I. I've also just thought of an idea that be might for the negative ones. And in that case, we can compare when we have a a baseline output and it outputs some words from one of the references, which is not available in the other, we can start trying restricting the system and and pushing it to produce s output similar to the other references. And whether it it is possible or not. But again, that's that's just. Just brief idea, so. Maybe something to think about.",
            "So that so that like as soon as you see a hint of one of the references, you will use this particular reference to to.",
            "Constrain?",
            "To constrain it and to avoid the other ones? Or. Or to avoid this one? To avoid this one?",
            "Well. So so obviously it would be nice to to identify any interesting words that that can be varied in the in the hypothesis.",
            "Restrict the system and then try to produce the new hypothesis and this might give us some diversity. But the. In this case, the question is how to identify the interesting words right? Maybe we can just drop the stop words and and just focus on content words, and maybe restrict the content words, but. Again, like this is would be hard to estimate on the run without the, during the the like when it's deployed to t it would be hard to estimate whether the other hypotheses are relevant or like qual of of a decent quality, right? So yeah, like again, just maybe something to think about. I haven't thought this through either. Yet. So so.",
            "And and another word of warning. Even with the simpler idea that PERSON6 is now exploring.",
            "I think that we wi we really have to do some manual evaluation, in addition to the blast course.",
            "Because well the the set of references is not big enough, it's not like solid evaluation.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I think it's. Yeah, we really need to. Once we have some some results, we need to select a small set of of the options and and evaluate those manually. In an annotation exercise.",
            "So so so so the multi-referential data set that's how many sentences? 50 or or 100?",
            "There's one with 50 and another one there I'm planning to use has 1400 sentences. And each one has around 4300 references, so.",
            "We have. Maybe these two data sets are going to work, I don't know.",
            "How how many references do you have for the second one? What is the second one?",
            "The second one is a multip Czech ref multiple Czech references in. It it has 1400 source sentences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And it has has four thousand three hundred references.",
            "Four thousand.",
            "For each sentence, I think.",
            "Four thousand?",
            "Four. Four.",
            "Four.",
            "Four thousand, sorry.",
            "Yes.",
            "Sorry, my pronunciation of numbers is terrible.",
            "Okay. Four thousand, references. Around four thousand references for each sentence. As as I have noted.",
            "That's strange. No, no, no. I d I can't.",
            "No no no.",
            "No?",
            "Four references.",
            "It should be altogether four thousand references.",
            "Oh man, yeah, I I I. This this notes are terrible, yeah, I'm sorry.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will check that again, but the. Confirm that that the the the first one, that I has fif the many Czech references.",
            "Yes.",
            "It has ifty sentences, but.",
            "That's correct.",
            "But.",
            "Yeah.",
            "One thousand sentence. One thousand references, right?",
            "Easily. So there are many so. There there are actually dozens of thousands of of of references. So this is this is a very small set in number of source sentences, but very diverse. And all the other ones are more normal. So you have more sentences. And just a few handful of references there.",
            "Yeah, it's the some of them, I'm sorry, yeah. The reference the the second one is just the the some of the all all references.",
            "Yeah. Yeah yeah.",
            "Okay, I'm sorry about that.",
            "Actually, the the the data set with the 50 references per per sentence, that can be quite well used for measuring the diversity of the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Our n-best list generation matters, right? Because we can do it in a way. We can basically do it as an. Well, okay. It it can be treated as a information retrieval, right? We are hoping to produce several hypotheses that are in the in the list of similar references or provided references, right?",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking that we can we can measure how many constraints work. For example, let's think that we are the user and and we can think how many constraints we need to add to che to to to reach the the reference we want.",
            "Yeah. And this is also an something that we can try, right?",
            "Okay, I get one one constraint and it already outputs the reference I want. The sentence I want. But how many will I need to to to provide the.",
            "To reach the sentence. So I think that we can measure that also. I don't know. I still have to think more about that.",
            "Now I was focusing on training that and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Unfortunately it took too much time for for me to to to s to start training. But now I think that I can gave more time to think about the experiments.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Thank you.",
            "PERSON6 I think I think that's that's fine for today. As far as the task is concerned, we can discuss it several times during the week. Or possibly PERSON7 wants to. But I don't think it it's this week, maybe next week, we can have a separate discussion on this. Right? So, I think if there are no other question, this should be it for this week, right?",
            "Yeah, I was just curious if if PERSON9 is happy, because it's his week like third day in practice, or maybe. So if if PERSON9 is still on the call, if everything works as expected?",
            "Maybe he's muted, yeah. Too too strong.",
            "Well.",
            "He's he's still getting used to the environment.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And and on for PERSON6, I was curious, how is LOCATION1 doing in in the COVID pandemic? Because here they're like making ever all the restrictions harsher and harsher, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How is LOCATION1 doing?",
            "We still have the the restrictions. But people people are are are are the big problem here, because they are still around and masks and stuff and stuff. But the the cases are decreasing, so we are.",
            "Happy about that, but it's slow decrease, because they are like 600 people dying every day, so.",
            "Six hundred. Yeah,. Dying? And not not getting.",
            "Dying, yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm checking the the your numbers as well.",
            "But and. They are increasing, right? But they're almost no deaths compared to to LOCATION1. The LOCATION1 is is is -",
            "Yeah, but what is the population of LOCATION1? It's.",
            "Yeah, it's like.",
            "Quarter billion? No?",
            "No, two billion I think.",
            "Two billion, oh oh oh okay.",
            "But yet, there are too many deaths.",
            "And people don't seem to be worried, so.",
            "Anything. Yeah. There is, But that's fine. I'm I'm.",
            "As long as you keep yourself isolated.",
            "I'm trying to keep isolated.",
            "Yeah, I I I I think we ar also the PERSON6's oc currently working on the getting the visa, so. But.",
            "Oh yeah.",
            "But we can again that that's can be discussed in a separate.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Conversation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",

            "Yeah, we, we, we have to talk to him.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah, PERSON1 you were, you were saying something.",
            "No, I am just trying to understand what is going on and how can i help.",
            "Oh, okay,",
            "No, the, the thing is that this has to run and this has to run smoothly.",
            "Yes -",
            "So the thing is -",
            "I understand.",
            "Without -",
            "I just thought -",
            "Without speaker intervention -",
            "I thought that it is already working, and, but, it, it doesn't, okay.",
            "Yeah, so, yeah last day, when the, like it took a lot of time to make the interface run - So -",
            "Um-hum, um-hum -",
            "I'm really sceptical that how -",
            "Yes -",
            "How easily the annotators.",
            "Annotators -",
            "Can do it -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah-yeah -",
            "Because it took a lot -",
            "Lot of time with us being the technical persons, but it still took a lot of time for us.",
            "Yes -",
            "Anyways -",
            "But it means, what does it mean? So what should we do -",
            "What is the.",
            "It means that,, different an. So that the thing that came out is, That not all the annotators will have the same kind of operating system,.",
            "Yeah -",
            "Settings - I.",
            "I understand that there will be a lot of problems. But how should we solve it?",
            "We solve it, it. We have to do for each of the annotators one by one. Like -",
            "Uh-uh -",
            "Try to see what kind of problems they're en, encountering, And yeah, so -",
            "But in case -",
            "PERSON4 I think we need to ask PERSON1 about that, That they are going to be fixed. The annotators are fixed, who will be working into this, right?",
            "What?",
            "Whoever is the annotator, we have to like have a session with him or her and -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Get that thing installed, because -",
            "So should I now choose.",
            "Really sceptical -",
            "Should I now choose, a person, to,,, to begin with? So for example one annotator, wh about whom I think, That he or she could try to install it and. So should we now begin with one of them already?",
            "Yes, technically yes -",
            "We can -",
            "But let us first do it on our end. At least first -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "So PERSON6 can you ping PERSON3 first?",
            "Yeah, I did message him on a -",
            "You already did -",
            "Yeah, yeah -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So -",
            "So -",
            "Uh-hum. So what I was saying -",
            "Yeah, go ahead -",
            "That we can conduct a session for annotators, for installing into their system, But, then we need to be sure that this, like five person, five, Five person who are annotator are,, are going to work. So the, annotator should be finalized, who are going to work on, into this. And then the second step will be, we will help them to just, install this, Annotation tool into their system. What do you say about that?",
            "I didn't get, what should I say? So wha.",
            "PERSON1, I was, I was saying that, how many annotators we have for this work, Are they fixed? That we are going to have 5 annotators or 10 an, annotators -",
            "Well -",
            "How many annotators do we have? Who -",
            "Well, we can set up -",
            "Who are going to work on to this. Um-hum.",
            "Well, I can't say that,, well, I may ask five people to start working with that.",
            "Um-hm.",
            "For example, at the moment -",
            "Um-hm -",
            "We can start with five people for example. So, -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Generally, I have about, maybe 10 active annotators at moment -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Really,, it's it is never a fixed number, because, I have 23 persons who were engaged, but some of them.",
            "They stopped annotating, some of them just begin to annotate, And some of them, for example at the moment, don't have time. And but, they he had written to me that they will, have time in future. So I suppose that I can ask five people start working with alignment.",
            "Um-hum. So I think,, PERSON4, you will have a clear vision, In forming the guidelines in that case, maybe? And then -",
            "Yeah, but before that, this should run with us.",
            "Yes -",
            "That can be done very quickly, but before that -",
            "Yeah -",
            "This interface should run with like at least -",
            "Yes -",
            "We should be ambl, able to annotate at least two or three meetings, Like randomly, and then we would be able to see the output. And we give the instructions, so this is the meetings, This is the minute and this is the ouput, we want from you. And this is how we are going to communicate with you. So these things should cared of because first, since we run into another problem. We have to like again depend on PERSON3. And ask him to solve it.",
            "So now, what to do, maybe I'm sending him the e-mail as well, Because I think can prompted in his -",
            "I have written him an e-mail, i have just written him memail, e an e-mail.",
            "Okay, okay -",
            "Okay -",
            "You already have? Um-hum.",
            "Just, Calender. Well, maybe, we can stop the call now and afs, as he, comes, As he answers, we can redo it again?",
            "Um-hum, yes.",
            "Do you expect that, he would answered it now, or?",
            "I don't know, why not?",
            "So -",
            "Okay -",
            "We have something else we can discuss in case or when he, When he says here word back to us, we can discuss this as well.",
            "Sorry, sorry, I didn't get it again, sorry I probably don't hear it -",
            "If you have something -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "If you have something we can discuss otherwise we can maybe end the call -",
            "Otherwise. No I think, it's most important no, for so for me it's no multi.",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Thing,, I.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Say that it works, say that resolved the problem with PERSON3, Then the next -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Thing for me, is that I choose five people, five annotators -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "And what? Should I write them myself, and should I transfer all them to PERSON4? What -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Is the next step?",
            "Next step is PERSON1, that first this thing should run properly, At least two or three meetings we should annotate, and then maybe s, Like maybe you'd also try to install it on your end. Like we will, we will help you to do it.",
            "Okay, um-hum.",
            "And then when, when we all three or four are confident that okay, Now it is running fine, we contact the annotators. Train them maybe for one day -",
            "Okay -",
            "Like invite them -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "And say that, that is is how we have to work -",
            "Yes -",
            "And then the job is done from our, from our end.",
            "Very well -",
            "Okay -",
            "Okay -",
            "But -",
            "But, So but let's wait for PERSON3 -",
            "But PERSON1 -",
            "So we should be able to open the meeting.",
            "Hold on PERSON1 -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Most importantly than that, is now we have to like very quickly formalize. Our data for the shared task, you know the deadline is near.",
            "That means what -",
            "And because, like we have to be very sure, What is the data with us, okay.",
            "So what, -",
            "So we -",
            "Maybe you shou, maybe you would kind of describe, what concretely should be done. So maybe prepare is some table that I will fill in.",
            "Oh, okay. I can do that, I can do that.",
            "Because I -",
            "I'm not really sure what does it mean formalize, uh-hum. Probably -",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Yeah, maybe prepare some -",
            "It, It -",
            "Empty folder, empty, empty, table and I will fill it.",
            "Yeah, so for - So suppose I tell you, like, of all the minuting, data, That we have as part of our minutes, which are the minute we are going to have, And which we can't, like -",
            "Which can't be a part of our corpus, yeah -",
            "Um-hum, um-hum -",
            "So those, those, minutes and then, the ORGANIZATION1, that i have created. So I guess we all have to see and then decide, because not all the meeting minutes. Are useful, some are, we have to discard, yeah.",
            "So you want, that we see all the data from ORGANIZATION1 file by file?",
            "Yeah, maybe yeah. That's -",
            "What I'm saying, maybe we can divide that, because there are, There are wh, there are lots of. So -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Let me share, so you can understand. Can you see my screen?",
            "Not yet, just a moment. Yes, I can see it.",
            "You can see right?",
            "Um-hum -",
            "So you know like, this is the data that we have, Organised according to the dates.",
            "Each folder is one week?",
            "So, each folder is one meeting along with its minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is the entire data in the ORGANIZATION1 corpus, and. I have organized all that data in form of dates, in which day they occured. Okay, now you can seems like this, that this is, on 17th of January 2000, But this is only the meeting, we do not have minutes correspondingly, Because there was none.",
            "Um-hum, So -",
            "Okay -",
            "We'll erase this meeting.",
            "Yes?",
            "We should not include it.",
            "Yeah, because we don't have minutes for it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "It's not there on, on the website -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Okay, now, let us come into some, random folder, Some new data maybe,, of 2011, yeah, yeah. So you can see that there are, like there are so many, chapters, Of, on this particular date, it is 6th of April 2011, right?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And it has so many chapters, but many, you know, Many of the chapters are just blank, they don't have anything inside them. So if you go inside this, it is just this.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So it, it, it, it does not mean anything, right?",
            "Um-hum. So it should be, controlled -",
            "Yeah -",
            "It should be controlled manually and kind of cleaned up.",
            "Yeah, I can clean it up automatically, but I think, better to do, In a manual way, so that it's get clear.",
            "Um-hum -",
            "So, you can see that the majority of these chapters, Do not have anything else, but suppose for this. The 4th chapter, this is the 4th chapter of 6th April 2011, right?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So yeah, so this is the meeting that happened.",
            "Yes, and where are the minutes for that?",
            "Yeah, the minutes are there only - Yeah, this is the total minute file, for all the chapters together.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "OK, so we, we were at the 6th chapter, right? So this is the minute for the 6th chapter.",
            "Where can you see that this is 6th chapter? So, just this?",
            "You see, this is 6, yeah, yeah, no not just this, six till seven. You know.",
            "And where is that -",
            "So this one is that -",
            "Scro, scroll it down please.",
            "Yeah -",
            "To -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Yes -",
            "This is 7.",
            "Um-hum, okay.",
            "So this is the 6th, yeah.",
            "Please get back, how can I see that I'm in six?",
            "You, in where? In the minutes or the, -",
            "Well -",
            "Meeting -",
            "How can I know,, 06 is the date, it's not the chapter. Here is the chapter,.",
            "Yeah, sorry this is 04, okay.",
            "Yes, this is 04 -",
            "So 04 -",
            "Not 06, okay -",
            "So 0, 04, this is chapter yeah.",
            "Yes -",

            "And 06 is the -",
            "And 6 -",
            "Yeah, -",
            "Yeah is the date, yeah -",
            "It's okay, it's okay -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So you want that we, some of us will make the manual extortion?",
            "The next thing that I can do is, That I can split the minutes as, in form of chapters.",
            "I would strongly suggest to do that first automatically, Maybe mo, maybe to correct then. But it's, it's really very, very big manual work, That could be done automatically as for me.",
            "Yeah, and also,, I, what I'm trying to do is, Now, that this is the total entire minute, right?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So, I'm trying to split this minute into the corresponding chapters.",
            "Yes.",
            "But the thing is the chapters are alt, are only -",
            "Yes, also contain -",
            "Distinguished by this.",
            "These numbers, yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, and these numbers are anywhere in the, in the document. So -",
            "This -",
            "I really need to think of a better regular expression to do this, -",
            "Yes -",
            "Because, yeah -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "It is not straightforward, because this 1 and this thing, You can find many times inside the -",
            "Well, yeah okay, I understand what you mean, Totaly, I totaly understand the problem -",
            "Yeah -",
            "But I -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Am not sure, so I don't -, so on -, so now, different points of view. I do not know if it is easier or not easier, To look for the way to make it automatically. I think this could be a question to PERSON2, because I don't ha. I don't have any experience in that, but PERSON2 was very, very sure, That it should be makeable, and somehow easy makeable. But this is -",
            "No, no I'm not saying, that it is not makeable, It is, it is, I can do that, but it will take some time, That's what I'm saying, okay.",
            "So if to, if to sp, spend time for making a script, Or just to make it manually, you think it's quicker manually? What do you think about it?",
            "No, no manually it is impossible to do -",
            "Okay -",
            "Like there are 959 -",
            "So what you propose -",
            "Meetings, it is impossible.",
            "What you propose -",
            "I would do it, but I would need some time. I would need some time to split this into the corresponding, That like i would split the minutes into the corresponding chapters, And then, alingn them accordingly, whatever it is there in ORGANIZATION1.",
            "So, okay, what should I do now? In this case, you said that it's really, hard enough, That, so we should do it very quickly. What should I do quickly now?",
            "So, maybe, you can take care of the exact data that is there, Thus from the meetings that we are having, so, okay. So these are the 50, these are the 50, meetings that we can,, Release as part of our corpus for the shared task, so freeze that, these are this. And -",
            "So, I should -",
            "While you do this -",
            "Shou now, I should take care for our corpus, our PROJECT1 corpus, Is it true, is it so? And, make clear -",
            "Yeah -",
            "Which meetings we use and which we do not use.",
            "Yes, yes -",
            "Okay, um-hum okay and -",
            "Right -",
            "With,, with, ORGANIZATION1 I, I wait until you, split it somehow.",
            "Yes, so I don't think it will take, like maybe by the end of the week, It should be ready -",
            "Okay -",
            "And I hope so -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "So, yeah. And yeah, and then like, maybe we do -, we divide the task among. I can show you the statistics yeah, hold on. Okay, so I have like, organized this, the entire ORGANIZATION1 corpus about, How many chapters each of the date contents, And if they have any minutes or not, okay. So suppose this is 12 of March 2009, there are 44 chapters, for, for. This meeting and there is one minute, because we have not split the minute. So the, so now the task is, to split the minute into 44 segments or chapters.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So we have only around i guess 959, we have 959, meetings. Of different dates from the ORGANIZATION1 corpus, But out of them only 427 are heaving overlap -",
            "With the minutes and the meetings.",
            "How many? Sorry.",
            "Well, 427. 400 and 27.",
            "427 meetings have minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, -",
            "Right -",
            "Are these 427 are big, whole day meetings, So they will be further split into, splitted into chapters.",
            "Correct -",
            "Uh-huh -",
            "Correct -",
            "So they are actually much more.",
            "Yeah, they are. They are actually much more -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Right -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Okay. So, yeah, so so the plan could be, that within this week, PERSON1, you try to figure out what kind of data, We have with us for the PROJECT1 meetings.",
            "Um-hum -",
            "And within this week, I figured out,, what is the f, What is the total, number of data after splitting in ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Um-hum -",
            "And then in the next week, it is task for all of us, To like select, that okay, this could be a meeting potential, Meeting and this could be a potential minute. Because I made a, I made a random pass, and many of the, Meetings and the minutes could not be used.",
            "Um-hum, okay let's try, let's first -",
            "So -",

            "So, we'll see how this will work out. And that's also depressing.",
            "Okay. Well, I mean here the numbers finally, start to going down slightly. But also we are kind of unsure whether that's due to really oh, everything being closed down, or or not. But well, at least something.",
            "Yeah, that's right, at least at least good direction.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Hi everybody. I'm able to see you again. So I changed it to this gallery view, so that I see all your faces.",
            "You mean all the black -",
            "All the black - Well, some some faces disappeared when I tell them that I'm happy to see them. Yeah,, so, I would like to warn you again. Anything against it, but we are again recording this meeting. Because we need data for minuting and, as discussed with other project,, s like definitely we're not going to do anything with the data like publishing them before we ask you again for your consent. So now I would like, to to get your consent by continuing, in this conversation to process the data locally and keep it within the consortium. And, once we process the data, get the transcript with, through our annotators, and remove all traits of personal information. We would ask you again for your consent. To, to publish this for the purposes of minuting work package. So this is the new updated procedure that we are, trying to to follow in the hope that, it will allow us - It will it will give us the consent of the of the participants. So in short, this meeting is being recorded. Nobody else outside from the consortium, somehow legally bound to the consortium will have access to it, but we will try to process it and anonymize it. And then with the anonymized data we will ask you again, if we can use this for, the minuting sum the summarization, shared task. Yeah, so this is an intro. So we have, ORGANIZATION4, ORGANIZATION7, ORGANIZATION10, ORGANIZATION8, and we also have PERSON23 from ORGANIZATION2. And we have us, ORGANIZATION9. So I think we are ready to start, right? Great. Thanks, everybody for joining, exactly on time. We are following the agenda, in our, remote meetings document. And, s this is, finally, again, a standard, regular call, where, we have nothing special, no review around. We only have to do our work and finish the deliverables in time for that, and and so on. So this is finally, normal, a normal call. So the first thing is that we really would like to close the Covid extension application. So,, you have contributed some ideas, to to ex to the explanation why we are asking for these extra three months. So the document is now ready and we are submitting it. Full stop. So if you would like to have a look, please look at this shared ORGANIZATION5 document, otherwise, well, you can just the, make it happen. The good news that you are have already received by e-mail is that all our reported cost were accepted, so, every partner is going to get the money that,, he has asked for. And, we have already received the total amount from the EU. So we will now distribute, the money to your, to your sites. And this is obviously not handled by me directly, but rather someone at the Dean's office. So, I I assume that you also have, some such people, and we have already done this at the very beginning of the project, if I'm not mistaken. So we'll try to revise those links and make sure that we we know how to send the money correctly. And that your, your accounting or finance offices will receive that.",
            "Yes, just please be patient, because our Financial Department takes turns, and it doesn't go so smoothly this time.",
            "Okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, the the people have changed there as well, if I'm not mistaken. So, yeah, there - But we'll try to to to do it as soon as possible. Okay. So that's it. Then PERSON25, reminds all about this continuous reporting, and especially the dissemination table. So you can open that spreadsheet, that very familiar spreadsheet. So, the, spreadsheet, collects all the data that we need to put into the reporting system every now and then. And since the, first reporting period had been closed, PERSON25 has made a separate new sheet,, month nineteen till month thirty six dissemination and there - This is only one fake entry like, t, to indicate what what you should fill in, but, please fill in your dissemination, activities. And we have to be, active in this area, because, it's it's harder to make dissemination when the turtles are are limited. So the the the higher activity will counterbalance, the the the worse conditions that that we are at. So please, regularly,, think about where and how to disseminate. I mean, obviously, the especially the non scientific, non-paper, dissemination. And, whenever you do anything like that, planned or unplanned, make sure to enter it into the table, so that we don't forget. The worst thing is that you do some activity, and you forget to report it. Then you don't get the credit. So that's that's a pity. Yep. So that is, this dissemination table. And the same spreadsheet actually also contains, the standard, sheet that we already know. It's, about, upcoming deliverables or all deliverables. And the, four upcoming deliverables which are due the end of this the year. So in less than two months from now is listed here, in the in the shared document, and it's - Yeah, so I'll I'll just read all of them. So we need some final training data. And it's, type, of the report, type of the deliverable which says that this is like open data. But it anyway has to be accompanied with some, pdf to to explain what is in the data. So, take it as as a normal deliverable kind of. It's the main responsible here is, ORGANIZATION7 because they are coordinating the work package one. And for all the deliverables I would actually like, to find reviewers right away during this call. So, please volunteer and enter yourself here into, into the the last, column. And we will copy that into the, into the shared spreadsheet table. So, we need final training data, separating confidential, and public version. And, it means all the data that we are, going to use. Obviously, we can then use other data as well. But this is like, an important milestone. So that the ORGANIZATION6 sees that we have relevant data and ORGANIZATION7 has done a very good job for machine translation there. I think that we are, somewhat legging with the ASR data, especially for, the other languages. And and, we don't have any person months to to like to any transcriptions. But we have some person months in general, like with the consortium to to reuse, whatever we can find. So, if there is anything that you can publish that would be better. If, you know that you are going to use some speech data that you already have it, and it's confidential. Then please, at least mention it somehow. Like somehow explain what size for which languages, we are able to to train on, and just say that it's confidential and we can not release it. But we need to show that we have, sufficient training data for all the languages. That we promise to do ASR for.",
            "So this is mainly for ORGANIZATION4. If they could - Becau I know that they have successfully covered all all the languages, for ASR, but we should, somewhere, and this is the place, report, the the details. Like how much is it? And and, what is that? And how - Just to have an idea how different is that from the target domain. Yeah, PERSON10, so, would be you, or someone else who who would know about all the systems? PERSON11 again?",
            "The ASR systems you mean?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well, I know, hopefully sufficient about it. But I'm not sure what is exactly your question?",
            "Well, it's it's not - I I just want you to confirm that someone from ORGANIZATION4 will write what training data we have for, ASR. And separate what of that can be published, if anything.",
            "And -",
            "We haven't collected any training data in -",
            "Yes. So so then you just list what you are going to use. Even from the past.",
            "I guess PERSON11 is probably the best person to do that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay? So so and PERSON11 will probably coordinate this deliverable, right?",
            "Yes. Yeah.",
            "Okay, great. So -",
            "So is the expectation on this deliverable, that we cannot have new data to present, or is it just like, you know, this is the data we're using for training, I mean -",
            "I have - I I think it's up to us. So we are definitely we're definitely, going to report all the new data, and you have this Opus one hundred, right. So that's a -",
            "Yeah.",
            "There is substantial, bit there and we have - Well, plans, but it's me and also another colleague from another project, who would like to make new version of the Czech Parliament speech data. So that would again be one new bit. And the the other colleagues also would like to have this before the end of the year. So, and also this deliverable covers all the all the past as well. So I think this is first deliverable on the training data,, or is it it was there earlier?",
            "No, that was no there was the very early one. I think it was after about six months or so on it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so anything that happen in between should also go there and I think that some of our versions, of of this Czech Parliament data were in the meantime. So we have, already processed some of that. But then later, we found that another colleagues independently in the Department have found the same source and process the data in similar way. So we have like three internal groups now at ORGANIZATION11 and we are putting their efforts together so that the next release is really joined and and makes everybody happy.",
            "And what about ORGANIZATION1 data? I mean, if if I guess complete there that would go into as well.",
            "So, the well, the ORGANIZATION1 is is complicated. So which -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which, which particular as background -",
            "Of the of the ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Okay, yeah. I guess any anything speech related, or yeah -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because -",
            "Yes, so PERSON15 -",
            "Because the text is already done I suppose.",
            "Yes, so PERSON15 is working on the, he calls it, ESIC ORGANIZATION1 simultaneous interpretation corpus while that would not be ready before the end of the year. And I don't see that this as a problem.",
            "No.",
            "And, also the transcriptions, there are only automatic,. So, because the the his focused more on the on the speech of the interpreters and less on the speech of the original speakers. And, the collection of the data from ORGANIZATION1,, from from the original speakers, which has some, unrelated, or not so exact transcript that we are not doing that. And PERSON10 can tell you the full story that he keeps repeating every time that that, they have changed the policy, and they are no longer transcribing it verbatim or something like that.",
            "So I don't think that, the ORGANIZATION1 -",
            "We should mention what PERSON15 is working on. That's true.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But we do we won't have that data as a as a something to train on. More important question is whether the minuting data should go there. And I'm now looking at PERSON18 here.",
            "Because, as as I described at the beginning, we have - So well, we'll get back to this when we talk about the individual work packages. But I think I was already talking about that last time. In general, we're not going to release anything until we get the second round of consents. And until we anonymize it. So, so the minuting data - There will be s, a lot to write about the progress of their development. But the data itself will not be ready before the end of the year, either,. But that's, I think that's that's okay. We will somehow simply say that, you know - Here we could blame Covid as well. For the for the delay. We we will have the data for, the first, sample would be for January. And then March is the deadline, for, the shared tasks so the participants have enough time to to use the data. Is that correct PERSON18?",
            "So I think it would be a bit early than that, earlier than that. Because, you know, like in November thirtieth there is the deadline for the shared task proposal submission.",
            "And by December we will have the results that which shared tasks are so I would give that by January end we have to have all did already.",
            "Yeah. Well, the timeline, the timeline of the shared task is up to us. So please make sure to be in touch with PERSON22 and especially PERSON21,, so that, we are confident that we can have the data by the date that we promised ourselves. And I would rather put there March, because, we know that we have to remove the, the names from the data.",
            "Yeah. So a bit update on the on ORGANIZATION1 things. So the ORGANIZATION1 data that was part of the machine translation project, get sometime bad. So we have successfully crawled the minutes for tho for those, and we have aligned those. So that is the PROJECT2s. But yeah.",
            "Okay, so that that part then can be published already before the end of the year. And that actually that's the the the the that goes back to to PERSON16. So it is not speech data. But it is, data for meeting summarization. It's the long text transcript and the abbreviated version of that, but it comes from ORGANIZATION1. So when you say \"the ORGANIZATION1 data\" it really becomes complicated, because you can have like speech data, interpretation data and summarization data. And we are, so PERSON18 is, is is working on the on the on the summarization data from that and PERSON15 on the interpretation data. And we are not really doing anything for the speech data. Yeah, okay? So that's - So,, so PERSON11 you now know your contributors, at least PERSON11 and PERSON18 and and yourself.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the reviewer. So who would, who would be a good review for this? I'm thinking, perhaps ORGANIZATION8? Just like tentatively?",
            "Well,, okay.",
            "Yeah, because I hear that. You're not not involved in the creation of that, so -",
            "I I understand. Okay, we will try to do our best.",
            "So I I'll put your name with question mark, and we'll we'll see. Okay. So then we have to have report, an intermediate report on multilingual machine translation.",
            "Here we are the main, people. And I see PERSON15 here, great. So I absolutely rely on PERSON15 on on, like overseeing this. PERSON15 is also working on some multilingual, system himself, and we, have the master thesis from the past. And we will have some more experiments from the from that student. But if anybody else has done anything, on multilingual machine translation. And ORGANIZATION7 has that paper that goes with the Opus one hundred that definitely should go in.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't expect anything there from ORGANIZATION4, but I may be wrong. Is there anything that ORGANIZATION4 has to say to multilingual machine translation?",
            "I'm pretty sure we have to say lot to multilingual machine translation.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but like specifically. I don't remember d any any specific work, but tell please tell me. So who who would be the person, PERSON7?",
            "I think I - Yeah, PERSON7 and especially, but you can it with PERSON7. But we have done quite some work on -",
            "Okay.",
            "On MTs.",
            "Okay, okay. Then it's very important for us to, like have the deliverables so that we learn about that. Yeah,, so, so PERSON15. You now know your contributors. Through PERSON7 you will get to Lee. And, PERSON11 will probably probably, provide the ORGANIZATION7 content and their outsource.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah, thank you. And the reviewer. So. Well, This would again call for, call for, ORGANIZATION8, but that would be too, too much.",
            "Well actually maybe -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can ask to someone of our researchers to do it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'll I'll put there double question mark, -",
            "We could have technically also ask PERSON23,, but I'm not sure if if, yeah, if if PERSON23 PERSON23 will probably say in the chat that his his microphone is not working, and he cannot promise anything. But, PERSON9 please get in touch with PERSON23, because I I see little chance, that, PERSON23 could do either of these two deliverables. And maybe the data one rather more, so -",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So so yeah. PERSON23 is like, not exactly in the consortium. But it's well, it is difficult with the ORGANIZATION2, because they didn't want any money. But yes, we I think we can we can ask him for that review.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Then the report on the, ORGANIZATION3 congress, yes, obviously this will be postponed -",
            "Okay.",
            "And the intermediate report on integration. And this is something which is very, very important. That involves ORGANIZATION10 and ORGANIZATION10 should be coordinating that, development. But the, since we suggest to put to write this again in overleaf,, yeah, I would like to check with PERSON12 if, if they are comfortable with that. And think they should.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So. So if you run into any technical problems, then, well, get in touch with either me or PERSON9 or anybody else in the consortium. Essentially there is, a section that you will have to write for ORGANIZATION10. Because you have, the the link to the to the inter, pretation. So so the the the speech recognition and translation of that. And that is something which has been demode already at month nine. So, you need to describe how exactly that that was done, and and how that connects to the infrastructure. And and, all that. So that is for a part for you to write,, and you can write it in any like don't, s don't be s ti to freaked out by tech. Write it in any form and we'll somehow then make the typesetting work if there are any any technical issues. But also and that is more important. I would like, you PERSON12 to to make sure that, the rest is also written by all the other. So to keep, an eye on the on the clock.And to make sure that in time, we describe what is needed to make this document self-contained. So, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So the main contributer there would be probably ORGANIZATION8 describing what updates were done to the platform, right?",
            "PERSON12, if you would like to have a meeting together with us. We can maybe, bootstrap the structure of the documents together. And maybe solve possible issues on. I think it's not that that complicated.",
            "Yeah. Just a strange syntax, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "But but we can - It's pretty easy to learn it. So don't worry at all.",
            "Great, thank you PERSON9.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And every - I expect every partner to contribute to this, by describing, the particular things,, components that the partner has connected to that. Not in too much detail, but if there is any like common connector that we use, then that should be described. And if if there are specific connectors, the the for whatever different ASR systems that that also deserve some mention there. So everybody should be should be contributing there. And for the review I think that's, it's on us. That would be probably the the best option. So I'll say, ORGANIZATION9 and possibly myself directly. Yeah. So for the timeline -",
            "Sorry, PERSON17. Our reviewer for the six -",
            "Are you, okay? Okay. Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah, I think it makes the most sense. So if I'm able -",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "To nominate someone else from my team then I'll be happy to do that. But I I don't have anyone in mind at the at the moment.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah. So... As for timing,, I think it's very important to have the first draft of the text, already s like, on in three weeks from now for example. We can then push this a little bit further. But the final text for the reviewer should be done like by December the sixth, or something like that. So that there is too weeks, of working time for the review, for the internal review before the Christmas break. So really think about very early December, as the internal deadline for the complete text of each of these deliverables. I know that we will somehow be late,. But, if we really try hard. Then not too many of these deliverables will be late. And the Christmas will be not spoiled too much.",
            "So concretely, you're talking about something like Novem December the fourth or something like that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or December the seventh, I don't know.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "How we can do it.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Okay.",
            "So let's maybe put it put it here. Internal,, deadline for all. December. Well, I'll put there six, which translates to fourth for the, for the well organized people and the seventh for the badly organized people. And, yeah. Yeah, it's yeah. Then we have two weeks for the review, and there is Christmas and and submission. So the, yeah. I think that that should work out smoothly. So we also have two milestones. And, one of them is improved ASR systems, obviously ORGANIZATION4 has some good improvements, for the English ASR. And, I really would like, to have all the other languages deployed. So that PERSON15 can use them. I've already told this to PERSON10 before, so PERSON10 I hope there is nothing bad happening. And the plan holds.",
            "The plan holds, we're working on it and training on it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I mean PERSON11 currently is still busy, because he is assist on the twentieth. But in the meantime we're getting the process of training the other languages started, so -",
            "Yeah, that's great. So as -",
            "As soon as you have any of these languages ready, please tell PERSON15 as well, because he has the interpretation data. And he would like to test it out through mediator to process the interpreters, outputs for all the languages, all the ASR languages. PERSON15 is specifically going again to focus on Czech, English and and German. But we also want to extend this to other languages, as soon as we can. So that's why we would like to have that.",
            "So.",
            "Okay, thank you. And then improve spoken language translation prototype, so what do we claim for ourselves that as the improved language translation spoken language translation prototype.",
            "Well, I suppose we need to know how how good prototype is at the moment or how good the previous prototype was.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
            "And how good the new prototype is. And spoken language prototype essentially means the whole system, doesn't it?",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "You take an view that really it's -",
            "Yeah. It's the whole system.",
            "Measure and the whole thing.",
            "Yeah. So and important contributer there will be us with the PROJECT2 test sets.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And the results of all the components. But I really think that we need to have supper technical calls quite a few -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of them in the mean time. So one unresolved thing, since the last,, s time is the labeling of the versions of the systems.",
            "So that we know how to how to label the the scores that we collect.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the two two people -",
            "That we have here on this, not in this call unfortunately, is PERSON1 and - PERSON4 and PERSON14.",
            "Both of them are not physically in in LOCATION1, but in case you PERSON11 and PERSON16, if you have time after this call like, in thirty minutes from now. We could make a quick organization call with them, because they have this, we call it eleven, clock morning coffee. In which we always like quickly discuss, what is, what is going to to happen in the next day, and so on. So we have this every day. So if -",
            "Okay, I have meeting at just after this one. I mean, how long is this this -",
            "It's -",
            "Standard?",
            "It's very short. It's very short. It's -",
            "Like a standard meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Oh, I also have a meeting, another standard meeting.",
            "Okay. So I can e-mail -",
            "So maybe we'll maybe we will finish sooner, and we could get it in the ten minutes before eleven.",
            "That would be ideal, yeah.",
            "That will work, yeah.",
            "Yeah. No, I think we should cowork on this and, you know, it, would be -",
            "So the purpose today would not be to to the coordination, but -",
            "No, no, no. I know, I know, I mean - I really have been more to it than that. I mean, how close, I mean, how much do we have of like an end-to-end system test. Because I I guess -",
            "We have many. Oh, so that's the problem.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So we have too many possible ones. So we're we're doing these regular Monday tests. And we're also like, using that system for other purposes, such as the the YouTube video that I created with a Czech radio and other things. And -",
            "Okay, but this is more like, I mean I suppose a system test where you have metrics and so on.",
            "So yes. So that's that is still missing.",
            "Aha. So we we have many like practical tests, -",
            "Yeah. Which can be useful, yeh.",
            "Yeah. And we have the,, s the the pipeline ready. But it was prepared by PERSON3, before he was leaving. And PERSON1 is only taking over that.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And he has not run it many times yet. So the idea is that we are - We put together the PROJECT2 test set, SLTF and the all all the systems.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I have already assigned this as job to to PERSON1 like several weeks ago, and he slowly gets to that. But there is also the,, s the the labeling of the systems. So so far, we only have some like first table with some numbers. And that was reported in the deliverable on the test sets. It was I think f, what was that? One point four, the the recent August deliverable. And there PERSON20 has run it, run the system to to that, and we we got some numbers. But what's missing -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is the evolution of this numbers over time. And the different versions of the systems. And this is exactly something that we should coordinate.",
            "And and this runs through basically from the speech to the the output.",
            "The it's it's part. So this is something that also we have to discuss. Whether we want just one final number, or whether we want separate numbers. And I think that we want both, because -",
            "I think so, yeah. Yeah.",
            "We have alternatives for the speech component with alternatives for the translation component. And then we have the, the whole pipeline, and that also behaves differently for the different combinations.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it's it's a fairly complicated thing,. We have all the bits and pieces, so I'm, I don't think it's it's difficult to put them together in time for, so that we are confident that we can tick off this milestone. It is just a milestone after all, not not a report. But it is, some like organization hassle to to -",
            "Y. Yeah, I mean I mean, okay. So if you take a very narrow view of it, all into the milestone is going to take it off. But it's -",
            "Yes.",
            "At the same time.",
            "You know,, we should be trying to improve our SLT systems and we should be trying to measure it. And you know, the set up do in the Mondays and so on that's really really good for just getting things together and showing that all works and so on. And people can look at the interface and and - But at the same time, you you know, we can't sort of go to the ORGANIZATION6 and say: Oh yeah, we looked it this year and we went to the last year, we thought it was better.",
            "No, obviously not.",
            "We need there some kind of matrix and for ourselves. 'Cause after Christmas then we have got to do this or charged towards ORGANIZATION3, however, that the work or whatever, demo.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we got - You know, we we need something there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also there is that that the plan to do a silent dry run for metaforum. So -",
            "Oh, yeah. It is unfortunate.",
            "So, so for that alone, for that, we would need to know, which of the components are the best to choose. So we need that numbers ourselves.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it's - Yeah.",
            "So I'm I'm now writing an e-mail to these two colleagues of mine to invite them in fifteen minutes into this call. Because PERSON9 will be there as well. So we'll find the way how to how to coordinate. So that's,. Okay, yes. And now, let me - So this will be easy to tick off once we have put, have done the discussions. And now please let's discuss the specific plans for cross-side, collaboration. So is there anything new on SLTF?",
            "And ORGANIZATION7? I know there's.",
            "Not on my part, still on my list. Did did you EAM? EASL last version I saw was not complete.",
            "Yes. But I read it too late and too badly so it's yeah. It's - I'm afraid that we'll again be rejected. So there is also the demo deadline, which is in January.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it's kind of acceptable. So s. Yeah, we did submit, but I don't expect much to be accepted.",
            "Okay I lookd - I looked in the last overview overleaf I thought it was not complete. But maybe maybe there was maybe I -",
            "We we somehow completed it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, exactly. But, yeah. It's - Yeah. So that's - Okay. Let's let's just think about how to get some work on this. And actually the, the the discussion about the evaluation of the system will be, will be exactly the the from this. So that's - Then on minuting,, I would like to ask PERSON18,, to, to invite specifically everybody to to to briefly describe the progress. And invite others to, to collaborate.",
            "Okay. So so so the progress from our in this, we we have been collecting minuting data for our, for our different meetings internally. At the same time, like we are proceeding to, create a data from the ORGANIZATION1 corpus like the the ORGANIZATION1 corpus for the machine translation is already there. So what we did is like we created the - We created the minutes for each of the transcripts, and then, like we d we crawled each of the minutes for each of the transcripts. And then put it by sessions so that now the transcripts and minutes are aligned. So there are a whole lot of minutes. So we got for around nine hundred sixty different dates from nineteen ninety six to two thousand eleven and - But the overlapping but overlapping meeting and minutes were for around four hundred and twenty seven dates. But, I should mention here were here like - Those transcripts are very very long. Like they have several chapters. Now we are moving towards splitting the minutes into the corresponding chapters of the meetings and the minutes. So, I think we'll have lots of data from the from the ORGANIZATION1 proceedings. The meetings and the minutes. So this is what we have -",
            "Yes, along with the -",
            "This is different from the the type of,, meetings and minutes that we are seeking. So we are seeking for like project style meetings and minutes, which are bulleted lists are rather than prose. And if I understand correctly that it's mainly prose with the ORGANIZATION1 data, right?",
            "Right, those are not spontaneous, those are not spontaneous.",
            "Yeah and on the side of the summaries. It is not bulleted lists, but it is rather, description -",
            "Well it is quite a list. It's not a full text.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "It's not, fluent.",
            "Yeah. So the the high-level overview here is that we are going to run a shared task on this. We are going to apply for the shared task s by the end of November, as PERSON18 mentioned. And during the next year the whole shared ask will happen. The data should be out for, for participants at the latest in March. And we will obviously finalize the procedures on evaluation, both manual and automatic,, style, of evaluation. And we seek people who could do, some systems as well. So we will do some baseline systems ourselves but the more s teams participating, the better for the task. And, if you have someone in your team, who is, who could do any t, like text summarization, system please get them involved. I have already talked to PERSON7 about this. So I'm hoping that, ORGANIZATION4 will contribute with their summarization system, because they they also have that,, like ASR independently. So that would be one possible, system, but there is still not collaboration. So if,, we we seek both the independent participants to this shared task. But we also seek collaboration on whatever evaluation measures, or, task organization, if you want it too. Or a joint system if we if we would like - If we would if we would like to do one. Yeah, so that's - Please think about it, but, do not only think, also get in touch with PERSON18, to coordinate. So PERSON18 is mainly overseeing the shared task.",
            "Yeah, we we would specifically seek towards having a good evaluation measure like we are working on that,, on that for based on some alignment based mechanism. But we would definitely seek some collaborations on new ideas that how we can, like proceed in that in that direction.",
            "Yeah, because -",
            "Because the current summarization matrix that we have had that we have, especially for speech do not really work well. They work well for single document or multi-document summarization things to some extend, but not on speech. So it will be definitely a good contribution that if we can come up with something that a metric maybe from the automatic or maybe from the manual point of view. From the, from as a part of the shared task as well.",
            "Yeah. Okay, just to give you a brief overview of the team,, on minuting. So that you know, which with with whom to contact, PERSON18 is overseeing the shared task organization, and also part of the data. PERSON22 is overseeing the creation of our own corpus there and also she is like coordinating within within that team. And then we have one more colleague PERSON8 and also PERSON2 who is labelled here as user, in the call. PERSON2 and, then PERSON2 and PERSON8 are those who are, independently working, on the metric. And also some potential system, some automatic method for creating the summaries. So - Yeah, that's the division of our work. So if you if you have someone to work on these systems, then, probably PERSON8 or PERSON2 would be the the more direct connections. But also myself or PERSON18. If you would like to contribute to the evaluation measure it would, be probably more of PERSON8. If you have something related to the, to the data, it's, PERSON22 and, PERSON18 in some way. Okay. So that's brief summary.",
            "Okay. I mean, yeah, we in principle we want to be involved. I'm not sure which of those three we could be, we should contribute to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So they have also regular calls.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So if you have someone who would be the person working on that on your side. Maybe it would be a good idea that he joins and listens in for a number of these calls, and then he suddenly knows what to do. So that's another option.",
            "Suddenly, just like that.",
            "You, you just like by listening you.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, right.",
            "So -",
            "How how -",
            "PERSON18 -",
            "Regular?",
            "Is is it every day? I think it's every day, because the team is distributed.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, every day at one o'clock in the afternoon.",
            "Okay, every day might be a little bit.",
            "No well there is no such obligation to that.",
            "But that's for our remote, that's our internal thing.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Because we are now spread across multiple time zones. We have to have these regular daily calls. Okay, and, the last, specific plan. There could be more. So if you have some other ideas for collaboration, please say so. That we would only get praise for that. But the last one is on minuting demonstrator. And there I had a talk with ORGANIZATION10 sometime ago already. So Adleheid, are there any news about, your developers and your plans, and the that I suggested?",
            "Yes, we developed now at the moment, tool box,, which should be can use for, yeah, implementing the visit of us. Regarding this I would come to you with some datas suge suggestions for another meeting, where where we can talk, yeah.",
            "Yes. Yes, yes, so please do. And please, obviously, invite, also ORGANIZATION8, because they are involved in that task as well.",
            "Yes.",
            "The the idea is that we have this promise to illustrate how automatic some meeting summarization would work for the user.",
            "At the same time, we know that by the end of the project, our automatic summarization systems will not be good enough so that the user would be happy with the results.And for that purpose I'm I'm this minuting demonstrator through the strategy. The user interface would be there for the participants of the meeting, and there would be some,, man which we call the transcriber. Or, there would be a man behind the scenes doing the summarization live as the as the meeting roles. So ORGANIZATION10 is, is now working on the user interface for this. It's it's it can be fairly simple. It is essentially it could be just the single button that opens shared document on the site. And, what we would like to, to work on more specifically, would be like the way,, in which the the transcriber interacts with the text, so that the API, is good also for some automatic system. And that the data that we record when we have these transcribers on the site of of regular meetings. As a that this data is directly usable to train some automatic summarization systems. So it's exactly the same thing as, people do with interpretation. So there are interpreters joined to to these remote calls, and, the sound is relates through them. So human does the job. And machine can learn from from that afterwards. I would like to replicate the strategy for summarization. So maybe we should, so PERSON12, once you have anyone who could be a transcriber. It would be great to invite them and maybe have our - And maybe that's also a question for PERSON22. If you have some of your annotators who are experienced already, maybe we could invite them to our next to remote call. And maybe we could see live what human is capable of. As as as summarization of of the running meeting.",
            "Yes, I can propose it to one of my annotators. It's not a problem.",
            "Yeah, so that with with some duct tape tools we should be able to to pack it togetheruh, as a first, like prototype. And then and then make it, a reasonable prototype to make it a minuting demonstrator. Okay? So Adleheid, please send some dates to us, PERSON22, myself, PERSON18, well, they will distribute it. The colleagues here will distribute it. And also ORGANIZATION8. So that we discuss what do we want to promise to ourselves for this demonstrator. Okay? And we have three more minutes before my colleagues will join, and that's the ORGANIZATION3 Congress. So what is what is the summary here. The face, face to face part, which would include workshop, w yeah. Meanwhile, you are considered autumn or spring at the earliest. Okay. So,, so I know that PERSON23's microphone is, is bad. I - Please PERSON23 shout in the chat oh, shout in the chat if, something is interpreted wrongly by me. But I assume that, there is going to be some remote part of of the ORGANIZATION3 Congress, which is not changing the date. And is still May twenty twenty one. Is that correct?",
            "I yesterday spoke with -",
            "Okay.",
            "With PERSON6 and she wrote me that there will be the first online part in the mid, April. But those will be only the necessary administrative, talks, and it would not, we we are not taking part in that.",
            "Oh.",
            "And they are postponing the real workshops and presentation to later date, but they want to organize it, this offline face-to-face meeting.",
            "So they they insist on the offline, s which is reasonable to do in this, on that. And they already know, it's not going to happen in May right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So that puts us in a in the real need to have substitute events. Maybe it will still happen within the lifetime of PROJECT2.",
            "But we'll need to have the substitute events. So let's take -",
            "Sss.",
            "Metanet as the one -",
            "Yeah, gonna say that. Metaforum might be our best.",
            "Metaforum, yeah.",
            "I know there is a - You know in terms of the type of event it's not quite -",
            "Quite right.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But in terms of them allowing to us to do it and being a sympathetic audience I think that -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's a big of plus.",
            "Yeah. So let's try searching for other events. Everybody, this can be anything. So I would, last time, I asked specifically ORGANIZATION10, if they have anything. Because I think that Germany is one of the countries who do run these, like international events and yet they use German. And they don't give up on their on their mother tongue too too easily. So that's why I'm hopeful about, about ORGANIZATION10 having links to, to some companies or institutions who, who do that. So PERSON12 can you, can you confirm that you'll like check the list of your customers and good close customers, and ask them if they would -",
            "Yes, we will check that.",
            "Yeah, so that's, we can be as invisible as as needed. So, the organizers obviously has to agree with that. But, we can technically we can only connect and only send it somewhere. But without the real users and er, some,, someone looking at the outputs. The the outcome is not so, not so useful for the project. So, well, even these invisible, sessions are useful, but, having a chance to to have a real feedback is, is is important as well. Yeah, okay. So, I see that my, colleague, did both of them getting.",
            "May I have a short request, please?.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "As we are preparing the data for, the shared task. We want to ask you again to sign up the ethical consents. So actually, it will help, it will happen very soon that I would send, the request to sign the consent. Please sign it and please ask all people you know, that have been taking part in a previous PROJECT2 meeting to sign them too. So that we could ha use the data. We have a lot of data from PROJECT2 meetings. And it's very important for us to use it as the training data for - And the test data for shared task. So please take it seriously, and please sign it off.",
            "Yeah and PERSON22. Let please confirm again, what I have, s, summarized here at the beginning. The current strategy for handling e-ethics is that we get this first consent to actually be allowed to work with the data internally -",
            "Yes.",
            "Within the consortium. Through this, internally we are going to anonymize the data of. For example, remove the sound finally and prepare version, which will be used for the shared task. Publishable version. And then before publishing, we will still ask again, the same people to give us the permission to publish this now anonymized version. And the anonymization will include project names. They will be replaced by placeholders, and the the years will be swapped, so that it is less easy to identify what is, where is the data coming from. Obviously it is not a full anonymization, it would be only de-identification. But we hope to to do it reasonably well, so that everybody can agree with with that. So this first concern, first consent is only to allow us to process the data. And the second round of consents, will, will be asked to, to publish that. And then if you like disagree at the at the next stage, we can remove your part or, agree on anything that you would like us to do. But you have already like s wasted our effort. So if you know upfront that you you want to be excluded, maybe say so upfront. But otherwise we we obviously, at least in this project, we we expect you that you would agree. So -",
            "Yes it's quite - So we need the the consents now, so that we could start to at the anonymize the data. And this is quite time consuming process and also will require some manual control after the automatic changes. So, it is important for us, that you kind of sure that -",
            "Tentatively, tentatively agree that you,, or that you you are probably going to give us a consent in the in the second round, once you are de-identified. But this is not yet the, the the final consent. Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So - Thank you. And I have here the two colleagues, PERSON4 and you see him, and also PERSON19. And maybe I see his face.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these are the two colleagues who are now working remotely for LOCATION1. PERSON19, is, mainly working on the ASR systems. So taking over what PERSON13 has started. So Czech ASR and ASR adaptation and so on. And PERSON1 is the the new PERSON3, so he is the operator of the system. And PERSON1 has now, taken over the the task of evaluating all the components. So he should be putting together the PROJECT2 test set, SLTF and all the systems. And, the I invited these two, guys here to this call, so that they get to know PERSON11, who is, overseeing kind of - Well, I don't know the exact PERSON16 from ORGANIZATION7. They're overseeing the systems from ORGANIZATION7. And PERSON11 is developing the machine translation systems,, and both of them are, involved, in in integrating that together. And also PERSON9 from ORGANIZATION8, who is, the integrator, yeah, yeah. Who is the main integrator, in the project. So she knows everything about the mediator and that part. And also we have PERSON10, from ORGANIZATION4 and PERSON10 leads the team of, the mainly ASR. But but also translation components, from from ORGANIZATION4. So, I would like you all, especially the technical people to, organize a technical call. And at that call we need to, discuss how to version, how to label these systems. So that PERSON1 can easily collect all these cores, for all the components and all the like pipeline, the complete pipelines. And we all know w to which systems, these cores apply. So that we, we don't have mess in the - Which numbers belong to to what. So there needs to be a good and clean strategy, how to how each of the party can easily create new versions of their systems. Simply add new label and PERSON1 would see that label. And in the final reporting, tables we would, s like show this label again. So there would be website, ideally, put up, by PERSON1 and updated maybe even every day or whenever there is some new version of a component. And everybody would easily see,, how the component is performing in terms of Bleu scores and other other measures. And what are rates, and other measures for for ASR. And also, the the delay, and s the PROJECT1 in for the spoken language translation. So. So PERSON1 could you please prepare Doodle poll and send it to PROJECT2 at ORGANIZATION11? Sorry PROJECT2 at ORGANIZATION11, not PROJECT2 dash ORGANIZATION11 at ORGANIZATION11. So there is this internal versus the external mailing list.So please send it to to both of them, actually. But the more important is the external one.Uh, and, let's find the date for this technical call, and, also, please, prepare - So does anybody remember - We were already going through this in summer,, and, or like around the the original date of of the Congress. When we were figuring out how to label the systems. Do we have any documents from that time? PERSON9, would you remeber? I think it was discussed - PERSON15 was also there -",
            "Yes, yes, we have a spreadsheet for it. Fingerprint mapped spreadsheet.",
            "And one output fingerprint was one version of this system.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON15, please share this with PERSON1 and explain to PERSON1 what like what is it? And then PERSON1 can start from this. And he already is acquainted enough with the with the big so he runs as regularly. So he knows where where these fingerprints appear. But s I'm not sure if we PERSON1. So PERSON1 please prepare like the the high-level overview, so that we know where the versioning should - How the versioning should be done. And, think about how to,, organize these labels, this system names with these cores, so that it is consise and easy to to follow. And then in this technical call,, you all will will say your comments to that, and will prove that it will it will develop that. So, indeed, the the the other best way to think about this is to to have a web page, which shows the systems that are available in the ORGANIZATION8 platform, and the associate for its.Then we will have the relevance cores for for that.And we also have a roles for combinations of these systems.And again, the relevant roles.And this web page would be automatically updated by PERSON1.So all the technical,, technical run, there would be done by PERSON1, with the full support from, ORGANIZATION8.Because they know if any updates in the mediator are needed or whatever. Then - Yeah. Well, or if if - ORGANIZATION8 will know how to do this with the with the mediator. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "So time is exactly up.",
            "And do you have anything else to to say? No, okay, so thanks to all for the participation. We have the reviewers assigned, we know that we should work on the deliverables. I think that we should have our call towards the end of November already. The next one. So PERSON25 please start to do the poll for the next call right away. Because, Christmas is going to be packed and Christmas will start very soon, I'm afraid. Yeah, okay. So thank you very much for your participation. And yeah, see you next time and at various calls.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye.",

            "Hi, hello. Can you hear me, does it work?",
            "Yeah. Hi.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, great. So thanks for yo. Thanks to all who are here. PERSON8 and PERSON14 said they couldn't make it today. So they'll add their bits to the documencht soon. And what is most urgent and I'll I'll like to start with so that I don't. Forget. Is the demo for the project officer. And PERSON4 is the main person looking after this from our side. Our integrator ORGANIZATION3 are not exactly, well, successful in in the set-ups so. To say. So I would like to ask we we had shsh I sa. Yeah, so we we still don't have PERSON10 I was kinda hoping that PERSON10 would. Would also join. So anybody who has some experience with YouTube streaming and YouTube re. Streaming I mean stream, live streaming of some video which was already. Available on YouTube beforehand. These skills would be would be useful. Yeah. Ok. So I it's probably none none of none of you here. What else PERSON4 could we ask help for?",
            "Honestly I have very little knowledge about these things.",
            "Yeah, so. Yeah, so if some other people join then will will possibly ask f for for that. Help again. Ok, so for I see that you're filling things. I would like to thank as well to PERSON4 and also to to PERSON10 who is not. Here and also PERSON3 who has reviewed that for and obviously to PERSON9. The Unihack subtitling. PERSON4 did you also have a chance to follow that, to see what it is. Actually doing?",
            "The Unihack subtitling?",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, actually no, I didn't get the question so what do I?",
            "Sorry. I was asking if you actually tried to play the role of foreign speaking. Participant. If you checked the content. What it is actually doing.",
            "You mean like speaker indetification?",
            "No, just Unihack. The the the subtitling. How did it go?",
            "Yeah, ok, yeah. That it it it went nice, it it was great. And I have recorded audio and the directories have been updated with the logs and automatic transripts. Recordings, yeah, so. I I think, but I I don't think if anyone even care to look at those subtitles. Yeah, so I'm in need, we needed, we, we, we, should have like done some kind of adve ad advertisement. Probably.",
            "I heard from the organisers that there was a person at least 1 person. Who has like joined that thanks to the subtitling.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So there there there were like only those. I think there was the first meeting which was the Czech and a foreign person. Join and he was like English speaking and he he was the one to view.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And that I think he he uploaded the subtitles and they were quite good. 03: 44 And PERSON10 even PERSON9 even said that the Czech AR the Czech subtitles from the MT models. Which is the back translated Czech was better than real ASR Czech. And that is a strange one.",
            "Ok. So which is. Operation. So we we need to ask PERSON9 what is the like to to to summarize that.",
            "Yeah, exactly, yeah.",
            "Yeah, ok. So, then, we still don't have. We still don't have PERSON10 here. So maybe you or PERSON3 will know about the English to 41 MT model testing. So what is the what is the status there?",
            "Last time when I was testing, PERSON10 made many corrections that. The delay issue. But still it's there and it's not properly is not properly fixed but. It has been like taking care of right now. Make it to make it bit usable. And I think. So right now I want using PERSON3's MT wrapper with with his with that MT. Models right now. And I plan to do with in the next future sessions.",
            "Yeah. So we need aside from this testing whether like it works in some way or. Whether the delay is acceptable. We also need to really start the testing on the PROJECT1 test set. So we need numbers. We need blascores, we need delays whatever, we need this regular loop of the. The leather climbing. So are you. So I guess you should now now your priority really is the the demo. But this is this is the thing that you should focus on very soon after. That or like when when you're waiting for someone for the demo or. Yeah, when your demo scripts are kind of Okay and you're waiting for the. Session to test them with other people, please start working on the. Evaluation of the translation models and also the ASR models. So this this whole Unihack thing that can again be a test set. A part of a test set, if we get it transcribed. The, we can evaluate word error rate, yeah, and and all that. So please start, yeah, yeah. Better than Czech ASR. How did it go. Some kind of a report. Yep. So, here the lag was still there. So the next step is that PERSON10 should still look at it?",
            "Yeah, yeah. And PERSON10 will be running some things with tests. And for it.",
            "PERSON4 will look at it and here PERSON7 reminds of the need to start. Leather climbing with PROJECT1 test set. Yeah, yeah, Okay. And then thanks for the punctuation retrain. The stats look good. I know this is only recall. So that's what we are focusing on.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "And we see some improvement, the more sentences you have in the training. Data the higher the recall. I hope that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I hope the precision is not decreasing much.",
            "No. No. No.",
            "But, yeah. But I would like. So this is this looks promising. Still give especially given the problems that we have with the segments are. Too short, too long, then I would prefer the recall to really get close to. 100. Even at the cost of decreased precision. So so really let's let's like overshoot recall.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that I think that would be usefull. So I'll yep. So PERSON7 suggest to really try overshooting recall. The point is that we can then hide the full stops to the user. But we can use these segments to get the translations faster. S. And like more responsive. So the full stops could be then used only internally. Not shown to the users. But still they would greatly improve the responsiveness. So to say. Of MT. So, yeah.",
            "Yep, yep.",
            "Yeah, Ok? So preparation for the meeting with demo, great. Start testing on PROJECT1 test leather climb, yeah yeah, ok, great. Great, so we have PERSON6. PERSON6 can you talk? Just quick check of the connection. Scripts were written, put results and put them make it to. Yeah, yeah, ok. So to summarise, PERSON6 has processed the submissions to SLT. I know, thanks for resending that e-mail that that I accidentally somehow. Deleted. I got any hac I do have the the new copy. But I I still have not had a time to to like look at those numbers. And exactly, yes. Pre-start processing that the all the results now. One more message is that PERSON7 has recieved remark from a team who failed to. Participate in time. PERSON7 ask them again. Asked them if they could participate late so possibly, but this is not sure. There could be 1 more submission coming. Late. It will be mar. If we if it arrives it will mark it as late. Ok, yeah, great. So that's progress from PERSON6. And PERSON3. Yes, please go ahead.",
            "Hello. Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, we can hear you.",
            "So yesterday I did spreadsheet with a list of submissions that we have. And I included the path and send it to PERSON11 and PERSON6 and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And so on. And I did a short review of this uni PERSON13's ASR start up script. And and of the PERSON10's worker and I found that it's probably too slow. But when PERSON4 use it, it wasn't so slow, so I don't know how. What's.",
            "So actually during the weekend while you're on holiday PERSON10 made some. Corrections and he added a new file with less number of language. And it has.",
            "But I reviewed this and it was slow at on my part. In my test but not in your not in your real session.",
            "Really?",
            "Yes. But I tested it with MT wrapper. Did you use MT wrapper?",
            "No, I I'm not using MT wrapper so I don't know.",
            "Well, then then the delay is too long and you should start using it. Because it's not realistic.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am still worried about the MT wrapper that it has like too many parameters which which. Are dependent on the type of type of worker from it's like a linear worker or. Yeah.",
            "But there is one convenient function in the set up scripts that you. Should use.",
            "Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'll look at it.",
            "So maybe, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. Maybe this goes back to another long standing task for PERSON4 to do. And that's to to make the the running the set up folder like make it make it. A stable thing kind of version so or like polish it. That's it. That's the that's the short request. So that our set up is the best that we want to have. And not always put together with duck tape. Yeah, so PERSON3 so. Yep.",
            "And I'm continuing with with back end ASR. So it's so worker which connects the Kaldi ASR to mediator. It's on very good way and I I think I can have it finish by the end of. Week.",
            "Yeah, so this is the thing that you had also worked on for the project. For sorry, like semestral project for your.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah. Ok.",
            "Around now.",
            "Yeah, ok. And the benefit is that there would not be the need to run the separate. Kaldi server and instead we will directly launch the Kaldi worker. Obviously it was like, you will run it on the cluster and it will connect. Directly to the mediator and mediator will then use it when when asked for, Right?",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "This is good, yeah.",
            "Yeah, this because this complicated our set up all the time and yeah. That's that's perfect. So there were always the port issues and things like that so this is a good. Good thing to to have. So the demo if. So if you're really successful, then we could re include this in the demo. In the demo session. Remember, there is 1 thing that no one again worked on probably. And that's the the diagnosis of issues. We have seen strange slow downs of various things. And we don't have a quick way of figuring out what is wrong. Once it was the overloaded ASR machine. This should now be easier if we could simply like start multiple Kaldi. Servers and in. Because they would connects as workers to the mediator and we could kill. Those that where the machines seems overloaded and and things like that. So this is this is step forward. But it's still not the diagnosis. So it's. I don't know how to divide the work. Like it's, I know that PERSON4 is is busy with starting these things and he. Is kind of irreplaceable. And that's risky. And we need to have. Well. This is this is maybe impossible, due to the Covid crisis because we are in. In different rooms. But if we are sitting in the single room, then we could help each other.",
            "Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yeah. That means.",
            "So. So PERSON4 in the back of your head thing how. If if you're like struggling remember we have this for the Zoom Unihack. Planning call. Where I was on Slack, you were on Slack and and PERSON9. And we were trying, we're trying to figure out what what is wrong, why it is slo. So so slow. So it was very sub optimal. But still we were doing something. So we need to have like multiple operators diagnosing what what's wrong. And I don't know who maybe PERSON3 actually then figured out what is what is. Wrong, right? Do you remember, it's.",
            "Not not last week, Not last week. but few weeks ago.",
            "Yeah. I think. Yeah.",
            "Because of this issue, this number 2. Now's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I found out why how to run the AS the PERSON13 ASR worker on and block the. Whole machine. It's just once one one line command. Not the solution that PERSON4 used before.",
            "Yeah, ok. So we, sorry - Some bulb needs to be replace this very second. Ok. So back to the. So this is this is promising. The back end ASR the testing is good and I think that it will be good if. PERSON3 was available to watch the test sessions. Like not to be all all the time there. But to be like on demand available. For the for the demo. So PERSON4, can you please summarise there is this demo document. We should link it actually. That's here. When are the demo sessions? Are there any more. So preparation for other meeting with PERSON5, so I'm putting the URL to the demo demo. Document there. Upcoming demo for PERSON5. That's the document. I'm linking it actually twice from here. PERSON4 please find out when the days and times. What are the what are the time slots in the coming few days. And let also PERSON3 know so that PERSON3 can confirm when he would be. Available to watch and really. We need to do, we have done many tests. And still we are not with the stable set up. We are making the progress. We need to again make well 3 big tests and like crash tests I would call. Them. Everyday until the demo is here. So we need to be really sure that we know how to quickly like pull it all. Switch everything off start it on again. We should deliberately kill it. So PERSON4 in 1 of your demo like test runs unplug your internet cable. You really be, we have to be nasty to the system. And you need to figure out how to how to fix it. So I'll put it here preparation for yeah. So, PERSON7 asks for many and nasty tests. Tearing of the internet cable and so on. So that we know how the system behaves and and how to fix it as quickly as. Possible. Right?",
            "So this is this is really important. Gosh. Ok so PERSON3. Is there anything else?",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you. And we have still PERSON1 on the call. So PERSON1.",
            "Hi. This week I'm I will connect with PERSON3 regarding the the continues SLT. Because last week he was on holiday. And and this week I haven't I didn't have time. To to get in touch with him. And and I'm I'm doing my inter speech submission and and also my thesis.",
            "Yeah. When is the deadline for inter speech? If you could remind us.",
            "I think it's the 8. Of May. But I I'm going to check.",
            "And is it anywhere on Earth, right?",
            "Hopefully.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Papers.",
            "And I have actually one more request on or question on PERSON3. In the meantime. PERSON3, next week there is again the Kudo conference. So I'll write it as a to do. Consider taking part in the Kudo based mock conference next week. And especially check the Kudo files from the previous one. Did I share the path with you, PERSON3 or did I forget?",
            "No.",
            "Ok. So that's my fault then. Net data PROJECT1. PROJECT1 mock interpreted conferences. Yes. It's in the directory 2020 04 yep yep yep. So this is, this is the path. I hope it will paste it here. No again, it doesn't paste. I need. Yep. Oh. So here is the path. It is one JSON file. And I move this JSON file outside of the directory with the stream. Files. So that it was easier to find it. But I haven't change the paths. So this this JSON file will actually contain path to files that are. Directly in the stream. That are in the subdirectory stream files. And it it would work as as links if if you like moved it back. But I don't think it's a good idea to move it back. So it's not writeable that's good. Because we don't want to lose the data. Yes, it's all. It's all read only. Please try to make sense out of this. Unfortunately, I don't think there is any like. There is a program of the mock conference. I'll try to figure it out. But I didn't have the assignment to the cabins. Because that was in another e-mail that professor PERSON2 sent only to like. The interpreters themselves and not us.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah. So then program. So it says. There is. Ok, great. So I will forward this e-mail to you. I'm not sure that you you got it. So please upload it it there. And try to figure out what is what. So, yeah. So I'm just forwarding the e-mail to you PERSON3. Please put the files into the directory. There is 2 attachments to the to the e-mail that I just sent you. And please put them to directory and then maybe make sense out of it. And please confirm to me and also professor PERSON2 that we can use this. Data set. Before next week, so that we can. So that we have a good reason to ask her for one more recording. She said it was it spend her too much of her data and like took too long to. Upload. So we need to tell her that it's worth the effort.",
            "Okay. And by which day?",
            "Well, I don't know. Monday at the latest I would say. But it's, yeah. If you can do it earlier would be better. Because it's on the 12. On the 12th and so if you. And I think it could be useful for you to to just see the platform as well. On the 12. So in the e-mail ask her for the credentials. She will send the credentials just the day beforehand or that's what she. Did last time. So she sent me the the links only on Monday and on Tuesday I took part.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, great, thank you. And yes. So PERSON1 has confirm the date. And there is this empty line and that was for I wanted to somehow make a. Note about this this joint set up that PERSON1 was mentioning. So can someone write down what exactly was that. That was something with PERSON1 and PERSON3. What was it?",
            "It's a just a that you mentioned that PERSON3 works on continues speech. Translation.",
            "Yeah, yeah. We have. Like the window based set up.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Removing window, the moving window translation. Yeah.",
            "But I haven't tune it. So far.",
            "And it's like a graphenes to graphenes or.",
            "No, it's text to text. And.",
            "Yeah, which is text to. That's graphene to graphene. Graphene means means normal words.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it's it's window of sentences into window of sentences. And I and I stopped working on it and I haven't try which part is the is. The. Should be the final one. Whether the the first window or the middle one or the last. So this this has to be tuned. Try everything.",
            "Actually, actually I'm more interested in results because because my. Acustic models are into phonemes. That means that I need to retrain my my own own model that translate from. Phonemes into graphemes.",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "So I'm I'm just interested in what what s what set up I or how the. Training goes and and such.",
            "Ok. I think I have I have only some negative results. I can sh share with you.",
            "Yeah, it was it was not much worse. But it was little worse than the baseline. But it was not much worse if I remember correctly.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I don't know whether you have written this anywhere, PERSON3.",
            "No.",
            "So there is so that's a that's a pitty kind of. It is in your journal so to say. So there is the there is deliverables for PROJECT1 and one of those will. Definitely be on on spoken languages translation. And that is where the window based experiments should go. So I'm checking June report analytics, technologies report. Yes, spoken language translation. That's the one that that PERSON12 asked for. If you remember. PERSON3, you were on that e-mail, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so exactly I'll put that here into the. So, these. So maybe le let's put it. Results by PERSON3. The negative ones should go into this deliverable.",
            "Okay.",
            "So please, write it down and you can directly like make use of PERSON1 as a. Reviewer of of that. So that it is self contained.",
            "Yes, but but it's faster if I just tell him. Or write an e-mail.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so write it in form which can then be easy it to convert it to a. Small report about the experiment to the deliverable as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that you write it directly in in usable form. That's that's it. So yes. Okay, so thanks. We do not have anyone else on the call. So thanks to all of you have participated. I've seen that some of you have really put some details into the surge. Table, that is good. So please think again if there is anything else that you you've done. Please populate the table. Because the time when I'm I would need to like distribute the points and and. Officially decide how to convert point into into bonuses and how to pay. Them. That would be administratively complicated. Especially now in in the current time. And like the administration slow. So I need to do it early enough so that it gets to you. So thank you. And will be in touch regarding the demo and also the interspeech submission. Or or submissions. We made it, only 4 minutes extra. So great. Thanks. So talk to you next week. Yeah?",
            "So. I I'd like talk to Dom PERSON3.",
            "To PERSON3. So, yeah. So I'm leaving the call but remember, in in 9 minutes or so it is over.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Yeah, bye.",
            "So PERSON3, like okay. So I see like the wrapper and the has the documentation but the directory of has has documentation but like it is. Look in documentation I find it quite unclear on how to integrate the MT wrapper with my like day to day sessions. So can we make.",
            "Integrated with what?",
            "Integrate with my a day to day my SLTs.",
            "What what is it? Is it just one set up script? One set up.",
            "No, so how how do I use your MT wrapper with with the MTs.",
            "MT wrapper has an argument dash dash MT. And there you use the text text client. Command.",
            "Yes, so exactly. So so then can we find the exact like documentation about the about this.",
            "Okay. You can.",
            "If it is not there then.",
            "It's in issue number 2. No, in issue number 3. There.",
            "The. So can we make another have this documentation in the front page. Of your of your MT wrapper.",
            "Okay.",
            "In in the simple words, nothing extra. So and then I think it will be useful for the about.",
            "Okay.",
            "And PERSON7 would would sharing testing sessions test set in slots so. What of these slots I myself have to come to come of the Sunday session slots like that.",
            "No, I I think the best way is that if you prepare the set up scripts for. Some for some event that then you commit them and I try to run them and I. Give you feedback. About them.",
            "For some event like.",
            "Sorry?",
            "What what event can you get it?",
            "I don't know. Some demo, demo event or anything like this.",
            "Like already recorded sessions kind of?",
            "No. For example the meeting with PERSON5 is is an event. So I I I think you are planning to use some set up srcipts.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Are you?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you should send me. You should commit them and send them to me and I give you feedback. What's. And I I can start them on my own and I immediately find if anything is. Wrong. And I get you know or or fix it. By myself.",

            "Hello?",
            "Yeah, I'm here.",
            "Yeah, okay, So if there is no noise from me then let's speak quick today. Again, thanks to all of you who. Okay. Who made it. And the shared document are highlighted that there is two events that are going to happen. One of them is the conference on March 3., Which is already in less than two weeks from now. And another instance on March the 24. And I would. So the the PERSON7 please confirm that we can take part in those. If you don't know now how, - If you do not know now please check with profesor profesorka PERSON3. And hopefully we'll be allowed to go there. We have already had the session in that room. And I would like not many of us just one or two, So PERSON11 primarily. And maybe maybe someone else to to attend that session. And test live following of the many sources. So that we relay the record they the session, And we also can choose from the many sources. So most of this can be tested off-line, But still is good to run it at the life session with real people, Because the pressure then causes more errors, And it is important to be to be resilient to the user. So. So we actually need to record the sessions ourselves. So this conference is something for which I don't know whether any materials can be obtained. PERSON7, Could you also check?",
            "I think we will receive the program of the conference sometime before. And and that will be everything what would be there.",
            "Noise from the microphone, I suggest that whoever from you group is don't present, Should come over to recorder and present from main machine, Because it doesn't seem to create the noise. Okay, So when you have the program, Please send it to all of us. So that we know if there is anything that we could do for adaptation. So, you are welcome. And the other event is the student firmsware. And there the goal is to get their new. New set of recordings. And to test domain adaptation. And to test live subtitling in adverse conditions. And the test. And we should also try to record another video what we are doing. So now I would like to ask. So, well, just say what were doing. So this is the update from the the upcoming event, Just mention what you were doing.",
            "Yes, so I was helping PERSON11 that in ASR. Was slower than running in ORGANIZATION3. When on the on the machine where where the worker training is is some other process. For someone else from PERSON4. And this cause the delay for several seconds. So we just need to use. We just need to make sure only one whose whose using the machine when we running. We are not say a star there and and maybe maybe you and read other workers. That seems to be sensitive. And I'm starting to - I'm training MNT model for to prefix. And I bring to start validation evaluation sets so on spoken data. And I right now I will I will adapt PERSON9's events events so so it will print the correct timestamps, Not the fake timestamps. And I will somehow. I already have the idea. So that's from me.",
            "PERSON5.",
            "This week I it was supposed to in this. It takes some times, I don't like OTHER6, OTHER5. But almost I will finish some part so and it's tomorrow. And I am not sure but. We can. So he can excercise. So and I'm going to train back transcription system, Next. From Monday on this week. And I to finish my one people to PERSON11. So I really start my training proces bad tranclations from Monday. And to search some other languages. Six languages. For election, for collecting monolingual data. So this is the brief summary.",
            "So this week I have done the evaluation of the PERSON4 talk like that two place. I two weeks ago. I corrected the trancsription and evaluated the our LOCATION1 ASR. And I also evaluated ORGANIZATION2, LOCATION1 ASR and against the ASR of university. That is avalaible on PROJECT2. And the result seem quite promising. That the adaptation help to reduce the word error rate. I like almost of third from like three point five for the baseline model to like two point one I think for the adaptive model. And, yeah, so this is, Yeah and ORGANIZATION2 had like above five percent of rank at the university six point five. So that was encouraging results. And I'm also started working on use. Using the some LOCATION1 corpus which is collection of over one million LOCATION1 articles which have available abstract entitles. So I would like to be able to search through this corpus for the relevant articles for our domain, And use these texts for domain adaptation on on on our of the main. I would like to use the approach of sentence embeddings, That I have been working on already couple of weeks. So from like a input sentences, I would like to query this corpus with articles. And select the relevant plans and then adapt the language model at lexicon of our ASR.",
            "Okay. Thanks. So, PERSON8 was not talking, right?",
            "Yes, so this week, I have been working on many too many neural machine translation. And actually I hope that it would be already done. But I actually encountered some interesting problems. Which is that I got data from ORGANIZATION1. And I actually tried training using these data. And I found that if you just use the data OTHER1 century, Such as such as it was mentioned in the paper from ooh from PERSON2. Then it actually works quite well, On OTHER1 it works like. When you translate to OTHER1, It works obviously even better than two the other other languages, Because that there are more data in OTHER1. But actually, If you just use random language pairs it will start to forget basically, It will start to mistake translation in different languages. So you only have one token for the target. And for example you tell it to translate to LOCATION1, So it will actually translate correctly. But it will translate to OTHER4 for example. So so now I'm trying to.",
            "Sorry, sorry. I mean that point produces some translation, But in the wrong language, Right?",
            "Yeah. Exactly. So, you always have one like control token, Whit you preparein order to.",
            "Yeah, but the system desides to ignore this token any desides to emit different language.",
            "Yeah. And I think that I might have either alone backsides, Or or the new just can't can't remember all the combinations of the input and output because there is no work inputs token. So I guess that if it is strange. If it is always trained just on OTHER1 and some other language, Then it can always like understand that one of them must be OTHER1. And and that's would they actually be doing the model for the paraphrasing, And then actually it didn't work for the other languages, Because of this. I think. So.",
            "First, The first thing is that we are. It would be sufficient for us to have reliably OTHER1 centric model. It is fine. I don't see that's big problem to do file OTHER1, So let's let's simply run the machine translation twice, first into OTHER1, And then output OTHER1 at that will be us all the combinations. The data that you have condens all the pairs or it's OTHER1 centric?",
            "Yeah. That 'the problem that actually the data that I got contains random pairs in random laguages. So it's really really like just just tell me to to random languages for every line and and produce to to sentences in those languages. But also I have my data that I made from open subtitles that's OTHER1 centric. And it worked quite well.",
            "And if you restrict the datas from ORGANIZATION1 to OTHER1 that works, right?",
            "Oh, no, Because that will be really small. So I will probably have add the sentences from other other corpora as OTHER1 centric. And I will train it on that.",
            "Please, email PERSON12 about this. Please describe in the email the problem,",
            "Okay.",
            "Because I don't think that there is any good reason why the data set is like we used in sides. I think that like he should. He was also extracting data from Opus. And or sometimes.",
            "Yes, he was the first the data sented he -",
            "Yeah, so, So I, I understood from his email that didn't restricted in any way. So I think that the OTHER1 centric are. If we filter out his corpus should be the same as you obtain if you only get ring the OTHER1 sent with part yourself. So please ask him and also mentioned the fake that we are not able to to train the fully multilingual system. But as I said, It's not too important. It's more important to have reliable OTHER1 centric system. And even with the OTHER1 country centric, We know from the past that the input token. Which indicates I want this OTHER1 to be translated to OTHER4, Or into the OTHER2 can be easily ignore by the system, If the domain of the inputs sentence is much closer to the OTHER1 OTHER4 data then the data. So like the more the the majority of tokens will kind of implicitly indicate, Well this is. This is on cars and and sports. So it should be OTHER4, And these single token which says go for OTHER2 is ignored. Is like overway we flip, it's flips it over to the other side of of the of the training data. And that is something we do not know how to get tha the aside from filtering out. The the wrong language. So we can run language ID on the output of the multilingual sysytem, But we don't know how to totally ensure that it. Language.",
            "Actually there was a paper also from PERSON2, Where they just they just train the model on one language per pairs. And then they inserted like they call it adapters. And they, They basically put as small layer between every to transform blocks, And then they tried it on and other language language per writing. And I I'm not sure would result it got but it it interested me quite a lot. Have you. Have you seen that?",
            "I don't know now, I to the to the source document a link to resent ORGANIZATION2 block about masivelly multilingual systems. And this is the beyond the scale than we can afford. It is three years of of ORGANIZATION2 work, So.",
            "Yeah, yeah. We can see. Yeah, it's here. Can I sent it somewhere.",
            "Do you have the. What.",
            "Yeah, I can PROJECT1 source document,",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, So this is basically one way that they found out.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, so for now, I will just train it's to be OTHER1 centric. And and.",
            "About the of the data?",
            "Yeah, and it should all around the work on OTHER8, So than I will tried on the virtual machine that I get for paraphrasing.",
            "You can try but it's actually better to test it on cluster and avoid than the machine part. Because we are happy to run the workers on the cluster, They can connects the mediator, So there is no need to run it on on the. So you said that it should order works, So that mean that your OTHER7 trained model. Seemed to work on OTHER8, Right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, please, Deploy it on the cluster, So that we can start worker on the cluster, It will be some some preping. This is PROJECT4. Or what is the backend?",
            "Yeah it should be tenderflow serving.",
            "So, PERSON7, would you have any.",
            "Yeah, yes. Models are is are in PROJECT4. And they are served through data serving, So control we have we have some scripts.",
            "Yeah, I actually did it on that I just took the deep fault model from PROJECT4, And I just replace the the preproser thing and others around it. So the model should be the same,",
            "Yes, yeah. So it will works I can send the the and then you connect it to the mediator.",
            "Okay. Okay, I think that's everything for me.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. So, that's all, We have any one else. I miss the presentation by PERSON5. And, But you can recall that. Is there any. Like synergy. PERSON8 and that of PERSON5, I think there is.",
            "The monoligual data.",
            "The monolingual data, yes. So this is something that was opened last week. And obviously, you still didn't have the model. Are you now in the position, Where so where the OTHER1 centric model would be available to translate a lot of data?",
            "I have to admit, I don't know how. If it's good enough now. Because, because the OTHER1 centric model technicaly yes. But the OTHER1 centric model is right now just trained on subtitles and nother anything else.",
            "Ok, so because it will likes the data, It is if does.",
            "Yes, So maybe I would wait until I can, At least at least some data from other domain, Because when will translate. You can really see that the like it is subtitle each.",
            "Need will be a problem for our domain of spoken language translation that much. So, in the training will take some time that would be again at least a week, I guess, Right?",
            "No, I think it will be like tomorrow,.",
            "The TPUs are this fast, right?",
            "Yeah, well, basically basically the problem is the delete to to give them that you see in a specific format, And half a day. But then the training dates like one day, maybe so.",
            "Yeah, please email PERSON12 today, And if it's not responding, Then maybe still use your existing models, So the quee tested. And we translate the monolingual data that are. And will see. I think is alwayas good to have the some bad baseline, Because then you have the the provement. And that makes you happy. So, let's let's, If there is any delay with getting more data from PERSON12, Let's use your model that will be test of it anyway, On the cluster to translate the large data by PERSON5, And then to retrain the domain specific. On this train domain specific model. On this synthetic data by PERSON5.",
            "Because the like process like first tv to translate, Then you read to train of that and only then you can deploy it. So there will be another delay. So I'm not here next week, The whole of next week. Can I nominate someone to to make sure that this meeting happens? Yeah, yeah, PERSON7? I'll check the document like don't on the. But I'll check it at the name.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I don't know anything about of the.",
            "Yes, this is.",
            "I can't this.",
            "No, well, you don't have to run it. You don't. You don't provide any any. Just information that you meet. And that people like PERSON8, PERSON5 cooperate, And like there is no on that, Don't worry that's. You are not providing content to at me. Only your part. Okay, so, That's it to let's email PERSON12, We don't have anyone, We don't have PERSON8. And we don't have PERSON6, So we don't have anything. PERSON11 is he would recording. So I'll I'll double check. And maybe we will shif the the time for this. Maybe they are on vacation, We will see. Please make sure that the doodle fall request your general available dates. That is important. Okay, so I think that's that's everything, PERSON8, if you have any questions or not, Is that all?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay, So, thank, thank you a let's let's close the. And I'll just we would like to talk to PERSON5 to write down, What is. Okay, bye. Bye everyone."

            "So I asked PERSON9 and PERSON8, I guess we can get only one submission from this.",
            "No, I want to ask. Now, I'm asking, what information about participants do you need. The institution? The name?",
            "The institution and the participant name that would enough.",

            "Affiliation and team members.",
            "Yes, yes, okay.",
            "So I got the same from PERSON9, But I didn't get it from PERSON8. So the thing is now like I suspect PERSON9 said that they will there will be only a single team from ORGANIZATION5. And I I also suspect that there will be one single thing from ORGANIZATION3. So and supposedly if we have - You check right PERSON1 is living.",
            "Yes, I have just read it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "Okay.",
            "But does it mean that PERSON1 is not making his submission?",
            "I don't know, But I think maybe not.",
            "So I I to say the truth. I would not so I don't know what PERSON3 thinks on that point. But if PERSON1 is working on summarization, Why wouldn't he make a submission on the shared task? So actually, I have no pro. So I think you could do that so probably here. So you why not? I.",
            "Okay, let us hope that, Because PERSON6 I'm not really worried about submissions letter, Because we will get submissions. That is for sure, Because we will promote this. But the thing is now we have this in the proposal. So for the.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So for the proposal I think like for sure we can assume that we have two from ORGANIZATION2 and one from ORGANIZATION5, one from one from ORGANIZATION3, So that makes four. And then we have maybe one from and one from. So we have six, Six which are definite. And maybe one from in PERSON1 institution in Russia. And I think I can find someone in my institution in India.",
            "So so I will definitely release to them. So that would make the count eight I guess we are still foresaw.",
            "Yes, I understand.",
            "We are still, But I think we have to make it up somehow.",
            "Yes, I actually think that probably if you pro maybe write one more email, Personal email not to the to PERSON3 that we need. And it seems that we really liking them especially. And that you need help. He just real promptly react. And write some emails and and get some names. I I think that it is it may have some result.",
            "Okay, okay, so I will do it.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right now.",
            "He really to help and I told that he to him. He was immediately ready to do something. And but he has a lot of other things, He just forgot it.",
            "Yeah, okay, so I will do it right now after this meeting.",
            "Yes, it can it could help. Well, why not?",
            "Okay.",
            "And probably I will check more and more than one name from Russia, So it's not really when. I will try now.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. That would be great. So we are just by four. I think we can managed it within by the submission deadline. So I will write it to PERSON3 right now, And I think we can get back to us soon.",
            "Probably he knows somebody else who makes summarization. What about PERSON1 if we can. So he is not very communicating. But nevertheless, He could know people who could want to take part in sh summarization shared task. What about asking him?",
            "Yeah, yeah. I think we can ask.",
            "Actually he is also in the community. He is in this summarization community. He could know somebody.",
            "Uhhuh. Okay, okay, so one thing PERSON6, The another thing that comes is like I don't know if PERSON1 is living. So will he be like be part of the organization team. I don't know like we have to ask PERSON3?",
            "Aha, yes, this is, we have to ask PERSON3. This is I do.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "Actually probably not, Because probably not.",
            "Hopefully yeah he was not participating.",
            "Yes, but if we need something, He would be really far away.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.",
            "But let us PERSON3.",
            "I was really surprised with the email. Anyway, it's like. So I have also asked him about the survey paper that we were doing.",
            "Like whether he would be willing to continue or no or not. So after that.",
            "Well he has prepared something, And and he was going to finish with this to proceed it and to finish it. So I I kind of expect that he was, He wanted to do that. He wanted.",
            "Okay, okay, okay, that would be great. So I will just start paying him and try to know, And also I will I will ask from him that if he can.",
            "Probably he knows somebody. Yeah, yeah, probably he just for what as somewhere where we could ask.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So I will just write two emails personally to PERSON1 and PERSON3.",
            "Yes separately. Yes.",
            "Okay, so that was that was that was it from my side PERSON6. I'm.",
            "I'm yet to finish, Because there are so many metrics. And I have to try to actually look at the paper right.",
            "Yes, so no don't worry.",
            "Sorry.",
            "May I ask you for one more thing please.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "ORGANIZATION4 corpus. So I have to write the description of our minuting corpus, So the data we use.",
            "I should write I don't know two paragraphs about ORGANIZATION4. How we are with that now. Do you have some numbers? Or maybe some text already, So something about ORGANIZATION4 that I can submit to the kind of deliver about, PROJECT1 deliver about. PERSON4 asks me to.",
            "Oh okay.",
            "To fail to to include some data about.",
            "Yeah, I'll have the numbers PERSON6. And I think data already there in our agenda doc. But after cleaning, Because I didn't really find it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah uh-huh, But it doesn't matter, I think we can just say what how we are on that now.",
            "Okay.",
            "So just where is it huge I'm looking at it now.",
            "So, PERSON6, you can just what do you want from me that like how the data is prepared. And where are we now without cleaning. So that is what you request.",

            "Actually important dates calls satellite events, special sessions and challenges, right?",
            "Yeah, right. Yeah.",
            "Title of the proposed session names in. Up to five bullet points on what makes yeah so up to. I don't not exactly up to.",
            "Yeah, oh, okay.",
            "Up to one page. I think we I think the document is really too long.",
            "I think the proposal summary we have skipped to one page like in the second page. Do you want to what?",
            "Something other than oh yeah. And the submission deadline for the regular interspeech paper submission. That's May fifteen, right? Is that correct? Yeah? Because we have to copy.",
            "Yes.",
            "We have to copy their structure.",
            "The paper submissioned deadline is March 26th for interspeech. Yeah, but we have to like the papers for approved special sessions have to be submitted following the same schedule and procedure as regular papers. The papers will undergo the same review process by anonymous and independent review. Special session organizers will be involved in the reviewer assignment and the decisions. So there really has to be the standard timing for the papers.",
            "All then then it is very tough, right?",
            "Yes, it will be tight the deadline will be very tight, But I don't think that's killing anything. I don't think it is too big a a problem.",
            "Okay. So we want that we we have the paper submissions do you want March 26th itself?",
            "What do you mean by announcements? Just a quick question. That is like the the results, right?",
            "Lika after yes, yes, yes.",
            "And system submission. Ejeje so that is to. So what is the for ORGANIZATION1 the the sessions the workshop for ORGANIZATION1 that has already been. Like the deadline for those has passed, or not yet? But we are.",
            "For proposal proposal submission.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it is past.",
            "Yeah, so the it's very. Yeah, we should, we should check. What is I I will probably call ss one of the organizers of interspeech, Because he is familiar with the interspeech. So I'll amused myself. I try to regime just now. And maybe he will respond. We will see.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON3?",
            "Yes PERSON6.",
            "I'm looking at these bullet points while this session is special, I actually don't understand the formulations. I I don't think we can leave it. So, because it's actually not the answer to question where is it special. So audi stating the automatic minuting for a low resource language like Czech actually Czech is not so low resources, first of all. And then it's not a big an answer to the question why its it is special. So I think we should reformulate bullet points.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Are you it kind of don't understand it attempting three task on minuting evaluation, as described in section four point two. It's not clear at all. I don't know even what do you mean. We should really 4.2.",
            "Okay, So I'm referring to the tasks that we are proposing as part of the shared task. Oh, okay, it it should be 4.4.",
            "Yes, then it's a little bit more understandable. But PERSON4 I would just I would really may. I think they should made these bullet points very very declarative and clear. So why? Because this is the first shared task, Because they are not enough of data yet. I don't know. So just to say something, Something like, Because something is something. This formulation that the reviewer can understand it from the formulation.",
            "So automatic minuting for language other than English.",
            "That is not the answer to the question why this special way this session is special. So why what is what is special? So what is the so special and not made for General Conference. Why the fact that we make other languages that Eng than English, Why we should organize the special safe session. So there are a lot of languages analyzed within the main conference not only English. So the main conference is not a specializing in English.",
            "Oh, okay. So this question is different from why do we want the interspecial session? So there we have to make the distinct wishing between a main conference and special session. But yes, probably you are right. We have to highlight that this is the first documenting minuting for language other than English.",
            "I didn't get it. But I just think that you are an easy English human readable. So why, Because because something. Oh.",
            "Okay. So actually, it's a kind of cop this information what you have in section 4.3, Probably in emerged together, Probably delete this 4.3. And the information that we have in 4.3 put in si put to this why this session is special. So it's actually twice answered the same question.",
            "Okay but if you can see in the call for proposals PERSON6.",
            "Yes.",
            "They also mentioned like about the five bullet points. And also the summary should also explain why the topic cannot be properly con covered by.",
            "So this is not the summary. So summary is just some part of the document, yes.",
            "So that overleaf is not what you will have what you will use as a single document, You will split it into details.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So whatever points they have mentioned in the proposal I tried to cover them. But maybe we can do some real incidents.",
            "Oh, well anyway, if even if you want to put it in the one one side a one page summary, I still think that they answer why this why this section is special. The answer is included to 4.3. And not into this section three at the first page. So actually, a section three at the first page doesn't answer even a little to the question the the question why this session is special.",
            "Okay.",
            "But we will already have the answer. So it's not the problem just to formulate it. So that.",
            "So I've texted the organizer for interstates this year, Because he has obviously many years of experience with internal speech in general, And he is busy at the moment in a meeting, But hopefully he'll respond to me shortly. I have described to him the our situation. And I think that there are explicit roads two problems or risks that that I see there. And one risk is that actually no speech is involved in our task setting. And that is because we have text to text data only. And we don't have consenc for more, We cannot give voice at the moment but we could do that in the future. So I think it has to be very carefully worded that it's text text now, But if the community is able to to get sound recordings for the approvals, Then it is it makes more senece to run this task from speech already, But not for this year, So that this is one thing that we should make clear. And the other problem that I mentioned is the timing, So really need to have the regular paper submission deadline on March 26th, And in that I would really seek for papers that are related to specificly meetings summarizations. So like the the speech aspect I the summarization aspect or the speech aspect of what we are doing. So any basic research, any any relevant papers for this partical use it of speech systems would go there. So we would have like a special review procedure. And I'm asking the organizer if it is okay fot us to have secondary paper deadline for the system paper which would be the one that you suggested in the the May 15th. Yeah?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So as.",
            "Actually PERSON4 I don't but I think for Asian we can like three two tool deadlines. But eventually we have to submit to same camera ready deadline that we have to.",
            "Yeah, So but but we have not applied for Asia workshops, have we?",
            "Yeah. Yes, yes. No, no, no.",
            "Yes, so, yeah, exactly. So the ORGANIZATION1 rules are not relevant for us. So, so if we don't get into in their speech then the question is what we should do. And we obviously can try to join some existing workshop which will make it for ORGANIZATION1, But I don't know which one. And it's it's kind of like going around the rules. So it that's a pity that we haven't thought of this like early enough, But I think the deadline was probably in September already, right?",
            "Yes. It was, it was too early. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it was too early for.",
            "But we have but we have other so if it doesn't really goes to interspeech we have other like six I have.",
            "Yes, okay. That's good.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "So that is for.",
            "So I'll yeah I think we, we need to carefully review this, But I think the document is really too short, so they want to read less. So that is.",
            "Okay.",
            "That is important. So like I would avoid the abstract. I would put the organizer details on this very last face of the structure,. The structure should copy what they are asking for, right? So the if you just open this special session and challenges. They have this six points. They want to know the title of the proposed special session, Which is not too clear from our title affiliations of the organizers including brief. Okay, so yes, the name's information. That that good. After five bullet points a summary stating the importance of this session should also. Okay. So maybe, maybe this, maybe actually you have the correct structure. Just the title is not lo not so like shining from that.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe, maybe a proposal is just right, Maybe just like it took me a while until I matched it in my heads in my head. So aa it's should be. Yeah. Obviously it is not anonymous, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. I think it should show the names, right? Should PERSON1 be part of this or not?",
            "Like, we are not sure on this. So what about you.",
            "Well we should probably ask him because he is he is now finishing, So he won't be really available at the moment. I'll email him whether he sh would like to be part of that, Because he obviously has worked on that somewhat even if it was destruction.",
            "Yes, sure. So I actually asked for all the details from in the minuting group, So he didn't respond? So maybe you can ans onec again,",
            "Yes, yeah, okay, yeah, exactly. I'll put just you and PERSON6 there. So that we don't have to spam everybody.",
            "So,, so one thing,, I would like to mention on this like. Do you want me to condense the proposal to maybe two pages.",
            "Yes, probably it would be a good idea. So I think that they, I don't like the biographies at the beginning, but that's what they ask for.",
            "Yes, yes, I agree. So the thing is PERSON4 like, then like certain things that have added are not maybe require. For example they are not interested in the proposed timeline or submission platform, other relevant information. What would be the evaluation metrics and things. So so I don't know like.",
            "So it's okay to have them there at the very end.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So I would put it like after the non standard resources, probably or as a difficult. Data collection session for a proposal summary. But your your organization makes sense. So like it's. Okay, I will try one more phone call on this. So I'll I'll have to move to Monday seminar because I I to see how to systems are. But I had I called PERSON5 his the second chair of all the special sessions. So do you follow me, Are you here?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "And he said that well first we we should have read this carefully this I I that that that he didn't say this but but we we should have realised how how that works. So this special sessions must not allow for a cheap way to get into interspeech. So in short we cannot have system paper susbmission later. We have to have paper submisson dedline on March 26th. So we should recall it challenge and not call it shared task. We should call it challenge. We should seek for papers that contribute in many possible ways. And we can obviously keep our schedule for the shared task itself. And with the ready people are welcome to update their papers and put the put the summary how they how they proceed it into like in in the special session. So that's that's good. But it's the timing is different and and also in the past there were challenges in interspeech but everybody had it early enough so that they succeed it in in they they hit the standard paper submission deadline. So in in the sence we're late and that for for that reason we require the participants to to first write the paper and only then submit the the system. But I think that something that we can live with. So please modify the the timeline so that the paper submission in the the system submission by far.",
            "Aha.",
            "And the papers will be judge independently of how they run in the in the competition itself. And we ourselves need to submit probably that's my guess like our summary paper for this. So that needs describe the data set and all and all that. And in to that paper we will then feed in the results. So there has to be the submission they want they they they clearly want to keep the the strict the strict. And I think we can that.",
            "So so the will be chosen by interspeech or we we would choose? Our reviewes?",
            "I think that specified in the here proposal if the evaluated by the organizing commity papers for approach have to be submit follow in the same schedule proceeder. Papers will the same review proces by anonymous and independent reviewers. Special session organizes will be invovelved in the reviewer assignment and in the final decisions.",
            "It's on the webpage. So it's it's there clearly. So I these now.",
            "Okay.",
            "But please modified so that we are matching the the deadline that's speech wants. I thinks it's -",
            "Okay, so the so only the papers submission deadline but submisson deadline would be later.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "And and we needed wo we need to word it so that we seek papers even on just the topic. And not taking part in the shared task.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we have.",
            "Summarization.",
            "Like so what we have now is a list of people who agreed to do this shared task thing, But what we don't have is a list of people who can submit a a real full paper on that. So that something that we have to keep in mind.",
            "Oh. Yes. And.",
            "Well. Yeah.",
            "We have still by tool because like tommorrow.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know. I need. But I have no idea at the moment. I'll I'll try to thing. Yeah. Okay. So well, Will be in touch.",
            "And, and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And final like like do do you think we need to to two page or you think it is okay?",
            "There is no limit if I miss anything. So the the the lenght is probably okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Sure.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye. Halo, PERSON6. Are you there?",
            "Yes.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "I just forgot.",
            "So we need to so I think we need to changes. In the deadline that is okay, But I'm still not sure that how people are going to submit the paper before the system has actually submitted.",
            "And how the evaluation would start. So I think we need to like hurry up, right, PERSON6? If it is accepted.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. Okay, so I think like maybe PERSON4 will take a look again. So PERSON6 would you like would you be possible for you like if you can add something in the introduction milion I can. Or maybe I can some your paper.",
            "You can take from my paper. You just mean some advertisement thing oh thing so what. This.",
            "Introduction to the task. Like introduction to the.",
            "There are so, You have these general idea not make I'm not sure but. I'm actually not sure about this abstract they are. Probably just to make this introduction something like so pu move the abstract to introduction. Do we need abstract here? Is not.",
            "This is not specified. Yeah it is not specified anythat. We can do that. We can do that. But I actually followed maybe from January like proposal submisson so.",
            "So I actually kind of see that introduction can be called so abstract can be called introduction and it is.",
            "Okay, okay. Sounds good maybe.",
            "So just maybe look look through it once more pleasure. So it really look quite understandable why not. And by c by people by organizers they want also some details no some contact details.",
            "Yeah, so contact details is already the email, I think.",
            "Okay. We are okay. Just we okay. Just don't forget it, yes. Yeah, they want organizer contact details and some.",
            "Yes, I think that emails will be good. So we have already put in the title.",
            "Names and affiliation of organizers and within contact information and the brief biography.",
            "Okay. Okay PERSON6 so I think like what PERSON4 has given. I will work on that. And maybe try to have it finished by tomorrow our coffee.",
            "Okay..",
            "And maybe tomorrow again I will ask if to call on, this is and finally okay to ready go.",
            "Yes.",
            "So if we give the we will submit it.",
            "If I give what?",
            "Like if he says yes, that we will go submisson.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay.",
            "Okay. So I will I will finish it us and than maybe like both of you to have a look.",
            "Yes.",
            "But I think I it can be only done before the coffee tomorrow.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, okay. We meet tomorrow.",
            "Just if you need something just right to the chat I will be more less there othertime.",
            "Ye I think we are enough, PERSON6. PERSON4 like if you want to something in the introduction that is okay.",
            "Yes, yes, okay, okay, okay. Fine, thank you.",
            "Okay then, please take care and. Hi PERSON2.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Anything from you want said.",
            "Do you want me to add something, Because I was actually usual but then I you things with aren't in my minds, That's what I want to discuss with you. That if you want some points you said that, Can you find some reference that how minuting is different from the summarization. So.",
            "So I found in the papers in just to provide you that if you.",
            "So so we have.",
            "Actaully.",
            "Yes PERSON2 this is very good actually. PERSON2 like I have written by this is different from from summarization. You can add the references in list. So that would great.",
            "Okay, okay, thank. So you just check once I beli make it as a comment and if you think like it's fine and, okay?",
            "Yes, yes, yes, sure.",
            "Can I make it directly. Yeah, just check it because yeah. Okay.",
            "No you can make it directly to the.",
            "Because I just because I don't have actually an experience with proposal for a shared task think. So that's why. I want.",
            "Okay, okay. No issues, no issues. Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Sure, sure, sure. Okay, okay thank you so let us meet tomorrow. And hopefully we will finish in that tomorrow. With so on. Okay?",

            "Work package please let us know, otherwise, we are already recording great.",
            "So, there is too many things to discuss in the. There is a number of upcoming deliverables. So, we have spreadsheet for that, and if you open this spread sheet, the upcoming deliverables are one, two, three, four by the end of June. What I would like people to populate is the column for internal reviewing. So that's I think is column number column \"O\". Yes, and it would be very useful, if you could fill yourself to review these deliverables, the initial training data, separation of confidential public versionThen we have periodic activity and function reports, data management plan, and then the ethics variable. So we as ORGANIZATION1 are responsible for the periodic reports, and the data management plan. I know, what the data management plan is, it describes all the data that we are collecting or using in the project. So we will prepare schedule, and we will prepare structure for this deliverable and i will ask all of you to fill in what data that you are using. So the actually this involves us, ORGANIZATION5, mainly ORGANIZATION5, because that they will have the most complicated part they are probably, and then ORGANIZATION4. It needs to describe the data that we are used for your ASR models and the data that you plan to use and prepare. And also it will clearly describe the data that this use that we have prepared rule with the help of ORGANIZATION2. So it will be simply a directory off all the data sets that are relevant for the project, the existing from the past, the ones being created now, and also the future what other data sets we are planning to, to prepare. And since we have ORGANIZATION2 on the call I would like to ask, if we will be able to use the data from the workshop, if we can promise the data from the workshop in the data management plan, or if this is still under discussion. So PERSON3, are you there? Or who is there for themself.",
            "We don't hear anything, so maybe it's not working. So who is there from the ORGANIZATION2. Are you following us? Well, okay, well, this is this is something that we will have to figure out. So I hope I will be able to, to also include the data from the workshop and include them in the data management plan. Yes, so that is the data management plan. I see, yeah i hear PERSON12 speaking in Chinese. Okay. So let's go back to the agenda, and, the upcoming I would like everybody to think if they can review the promise to review the deliverables. At what date do we want them for the internal or should be the internal deadline. I think the internal. PERSON6 had some on this side, right. If I'm not mistaken, or was it for another project. I think there are some concurrents at the ORGANIZATION5 side, because ORGANIZATION5 we're in an another project with ORGANIZATION5. And I think the first drafts, like the sketches might be incomplete in contents. But, complete in structure. Even better you have them by the end of May, so that we have a full month and for their for the internal review. We should have at least two weeks or so so mid-May. Sorry. So mid-June should be the internal deadline for the complete deliverables, and the the beginning of June should be the deadline for the complete structure, and maybe not complete contents for all these deliverables. Do you agree? So only proposes, end of May complete structure of all delivs and mid-May complete contents internal review stars.",
            "Ok, of course, ORGANIZATION7 is available for the the review activity. I'm not able to choose one of the promised deliverables, maybe the PM may be choose one for us. And for the last time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok thank you.",
            "Ok, so let's agree on this on this schedule. And let's talk about the individual deliverables now. You know that the, the deadline is at the end of June, and the initial training data, this is for for ORGANIZATION5. Who will be the person, it's PERSON6 right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Excellent.",
            "Beating other reading of this.",
            "Yes. And again, I expect you to expect input from us, and also from ORGANIZATION4 maybe, but mainly from us. And and from yourself, the schedule is fine with you right.",
            "Yes, yeah that should be fine for us. But yeah, I guess there are some questions over exactly what fixing to which deliverable.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I think the 1.2 is to the end of the month ten, which covers some test sets. So, for example, these you talk about that a WMT lead, but sweets.",
            "Yes.",
            "But I was thinking, maybe those actually belonging to the deliverable 1.2.",
            "1.2 okay, yes.",
            "And that is not one oh yeah, for task one point two the data speaker accent, I don't hink test corpus both recordings and transcripts from the student fair.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "Which I think probably also belongs into deliverable 1.2, but it's arguable was or should go into 1.1, but I guess we need to pick it right now.",
            "Yeah, well, I don't think it's too important. There will not be any review in the mean time. There will be, well, there could be the remote review and that could happen already during September or during month ten, so well we'll just decide this as the write, and the the voice recordings are not clear. I think this is this is mainly what should go here would be the domain adapted to the domain adaptation data that we get from Taos.",
            "Oh yeah, yeah.",
            "So the, addition data from Taos should go to the 1.1. And I think that ORGANIZATION4 probably should be those who will reviewing this because they will not be contributing much, or is there anything that your training at ORGANIZATION4 actually. Are you training any new models, are you..?",
            "I don't think that we currently training any new model, we training new models but necessary on new data.",
            "Yeah, so in that case, it may be useful just to mention in this deliverable that what data sets you are using, and that you are not collecting any new data. Just so that well, the little describe what we use.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "So PERSON13 to review the deliverable and maybe maybe to provide paragraph or two on existing data ORGANIZATION4 is training their models on. Okay, thank you. Then I'll skip over the periodic activity for now, and I'll mention the data management plan. This is the briefly talked about it already. So this is the directory of the data that would be created was created in and is being created and will prepare the structure and will ask for input,, this one could be reviewed by her voice, ask PERSON10, suggested. So this is our probably, probably-ORGANIZATION7 PERSON10 to review. Thank you. And then the deliverable on a ethics. This is something that we have to create. And really it is not clear what will the contents should be? But I think that the best reviewer for this would be ORGANIZATION9, because they are the closest to the people to like and users, and their data so will figure out what exactly is expected here. I am no clear idea at the moment, but I expect it to be similar to the previews, ethics deliverables, like describing the procedures. And listing the contents that we are collecting and so on So PERSON7 expects this to be similar to the previous ethics, deliverables. And if ORGANIZATION9 is fine with that to review. Okay? So I do not hear anyone from ORGANIZATION9, I know that.",
            "Do you hear me PERSON7?",
            "Yes, yes, yes, okay, thank you PERSON1. Fine so then, financial and the periodic activity reports, so PERSON12 please can you briefly say what you have figured out so far about this?",
            "Okay.",
            "So we can open the link. There is this part A and the part B.",
            "And yes, this report has two parts. One is technical part and one is the a financial part. The technical part has two parts, part A that has to be filled for Sigma For the Participant Research cartel, and the part B that should be a PDF which we will write abour what we are doing. What we are doing and how we got closer to our goals.",
            "So for me, this part B is like the easy part, it covers all the work packages and each workbook page, and each task have to have so think that each task needs half a page of status update what has been done and each work package needs a summary of what the tasks, how the work package as a whole is proceeding. So for this, i will need input from every work package leader, and obviously, we are collaborating on the task so again, the work package leader, can ask back for the details on the tasks. But assume that for every task, we need either statement that this task is not to be has not been scheduled, and is not running or this task has not been scheduled, and we are ahead of schedule. And we have this nice progress or this task is proceeding according to the plan, and we have these and these things. So half a page for task is like the, the rough estimate, it can be longer. It can be shorter. It can report on. It can refer to any publication if there are any that would be very good. So that is like the standard report update, what I'm not sure is the part A.",
            "It should have been filled for Sigma that's what i tried to put into that ORGANIZATION8 sheet of the continuous reporting. And those are the milestone, dissemination, gender and publications.",
            "Yeah, so just everybody know what's that's this sheet. So it is not only is the deliverable, but it is also the dissemination activities.",
            "Which nobody filled so far, if you are being the agenda.",
            "There is the gender details.",
            "This is a blatant line, we have filled something in there like a 20 seconds ago.",
            "OK great, excellent.",
            "Ok, thank you.",
            "So we need more input like that, and if i understand correctly this if everybody fills these dissemination, gender, patents, I don't expect we have any patents. But still, publications. What is that? The summer of publication should be written as a standalone BibTeX. Well, i don't know what they want here, but I would like to receive BibTeXs. So please for publications please send us BibTeXs. Here the short summary is populate all the sheets in this ORGANIZATION8 sheet with your data. So PERSON12 please paste the URL and provide BibTeXs of your published papers and papers under review, may or may not be mentioned in the technical part, which is called part B. So well, if even if you don't have a lot of you should describe the work what you have done. And if if there is a paper being submitted from this you may say so, or you may not need to say so,",
            "Actually I'm not sure if we as coordinators should be filling all those datas or if each partner should fill them in Sigma separately.",
            "Uh-huh? Okay. So this is something that will figure out what we need to have the information anyway. So use this spread sheet as the data collection place and please, collect all your possible data.",
            "You plate the link here again?",
            "I have, i already have it.",
            "The link is here. That's this one. I just highlighted it. Okay, so that would be the data. And there is also the financial report, which is another part of that, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Reports, yes. And for the financial report individual financial statements explanation on the use of resources, and the information on some cont some contracting in kind to the contributions, and periodic summary of financial statement, including the request for interim payment. I do not know what if this is we're not requesting any interim payments i think.",
            "Maybe i would collect names from like each partner with who i could have call about the financial report.",
            "I think you already have names from the past, it's the probably, so if the financial people have not changed, you should you should know them. But if they have changed please let us know. And I agree with PERSON12 that the best way to, to get the ready for this would be to organize separate call on the financial reporting, with the financial people so that they know what the data to collect. In shorted will be spending in the categories like personal, direct calls,. And then for each of these spendings, listing what were the most expensive items there. And how were they used in the various tasks. So that would be for the financial part, PERSON12 will organize separate call, preferably the call should happen next week or the week after that, so within May, for sure.",
            "PERSON13? I have a question I have here as a financial person Bentronimus, but i'm not sure if you want to be on that call.",
            "They are really taking everything over, so there's not really much i can do.",
            "Okay.",
            "The thing is we would have to double check with. If you double check within four days or so we might again, but I have to doublecheck.",
            "Okay.",
            "Might make sense that maybe our secretary Mrs..",
            "Sure, so if you just send me the names of people that should be on the call.",
            "Okay, this is hopefully an easy way to get to the periodic activity in financial reports, and who should review this. I would suggest maybe ORGANIZATION5 to review it, because they have experience the internal review. So PERSON6 could you give it to someone who has successfully passed from the coordinators perspective, this periodic reporting already.",
            "That's probably me, isn't it?",
            "Yes, right.",
            "Sorry, this is just a scientific part, though, I don't really.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't really want to review the financial part.",
            "Yeah, okay, so, PERSON11 to review the technical part and we would trust that the financial people know what they are reporting.",
            "I yeah, i mean, i'm not going to be up to review table numbers and save it.",
            "Okay, thank you. So that's it.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "Yeah, the upcoming milestones, so remember, there is still the non ticked off milestone. And that's the reporting, sorry that's a recording in the ORGANIZATION9 platform. And I know that PERSON8 has asked PERSON12 if we are going to run this call in ORGANIZATION9 platform already. And I said that I have for some reason I was still was not in touch with our main, so that we have not tested it yet. So can we test it early next week?",
            "Sure, sure, we talked to our developers and they will see how what are the schedule for next week, and then will send you few appointments, which would be possible when we could do a test.",
            "I would prefer if we could decide the date today.",
            "Yeah, okay. So test call next week and after that, if that works. I'll both tick off the milestone and also we can have the workshop preparations calls on Friday within the ORGANIZATION9 platform. The bad thing is that it will require Windows. So who has or Mac possibly i'm not sure.",
            "It's Mac and Windows yeah.",
            "So, who will have troubles with this or can everyone accomodate?",
            "I think i will have troubles.",
            "So you'll have troubles.",
            "Sorry, is this for the consorting meetings or what are we going to be using this for.",
            "No it's technical.",
            "Whatever, the sooner the benefit if I'm not mistaken is that the recording would have separate channels from the for the individual participants, so the data collected through this would be easier to process. That's the benefit. But if the benefit is like causing too much trouble to for the technical discussions. Because that will you would have to reboot, and all that, then I'm happy to say that we will use it only for the monthly meetings, the project level, and and reduce that. Yeah, ok.",
            "Yeah, I'm not sure at the moment how we organize that. I do not really want to sell windows.",
            "Well, I have a separate machine for this exactly for that.",
            "I mean, we could buy a laptop, but seems like a waste though.",
            "So this is this is essentially, what would we do, we just already have it.",
            "I don't know, yeah, we should, PERSON6 has a Mac, so we could share PERSON6's Mac maybe.",
            "There are lightly defeats the purpose of separating it, separating out the speakers i have.",
            "I know.",
            "It does, but I mean buying three separate machines in order we can separate the speakers a bit.",
            "Yeah. So after the test, tick off the milestone and then decide which calls will use it. I will say, atleast the monthly calls due to the like of windows machines. Yeah, and we will see. So, I will let you know how the test went and will decide something called for technical, but we need to have this done anyway, so this is, and it will be also important for the integration of the translation,, service, and and all that into the ORGANIZATION9 platform. So none of the work at ORGANIZATION9 was any type of waste. Okay. So then what other milestone is there. The first spoken language translation prototype, when is that as you do, do we remember?",
            "That's by the end of June.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Right does that mean, what's the actual requirement there, i mean what do we, what's the means of verification be like. I mean, we have translation prototypes i mean.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "The system and we went at the student fair can that be considered to be a close prototype.",
            "Possibly, so that we could simply tick it off.",
            "Well, I mean, we're gonna deliver definitely translation systems and would gonna deliver or by the end of June.",
            "Yes, exactly, so I'm also not concerned much about this.",
            "When do we will have translation system that's actually tuned to a spoken language translation is a bit more of an open question, we are going to do this thing with open the senses fragments.",
            "So milestone month six baseline first spoken system available to the consortium. Okay, that's pretty vague and that's the only occurrence of this MS2 throughout the whole proposal. So there is no further information on this milestone.",
            "Well, I mean, the milestones a really for internal usage, page 2020 project. So the question is, what does the consortia want? Is it's I mean, so PERSON6 isn't going to be, is gonna be wrapping this. The least producing a PROJECT3 wrapper and will endeavor to produce let's say the best system we can for that under the circumstances for the application in mind can now be consider the first prototype.",
            "Yes, yes, so I think that the will definitely have this prototype solved, because we will be doing the the workshop, and we have already had the fair. So I think this this milestone can already be done. For the Congress needs this is the milestone that we are written to be responsible for, but I don't know what that appears. B. Ecause it's not here maybe it is because we are the leaders of the MT work package, could be, but PERSON6 is helping us a lot with this. So here, i don't know whether I should tick this of as soon as the multimodel the multilingual models are available. Even if it is limited set of target languages.",
            "We should look bit on milestone four, because what I think the project pioneers is to done deliver say milestone two, and then that feeds into milestone four.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So that means this SLT system is going to ORGANIZATION9 platform. So that some more difficult proposition problem is, there is more unknowns for me there.",
            "Yes, yes, i totally agree. And this will happen in August.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So it's quite early and while there be summer, so it will be difficult to chase people around.",
            "Yeah. So what is making available on the ORGANIZATION7 platform sufficient for milestone four, or is there something else we need to do.",
            "Yes. So this is is built upon the the recording, but actually the recording has been now done separately outside of the, the ORGANIZATION7 integrator, right? So what we have for now, is the ORGANIZATION7 mediator that anybody can connect to. And send the ASR, send the sound too, the mediator will pass it to the ASR workers, and the ASR workers can pass it. So this has been tested at the fair. What has not been tested, is any integration with the ORGANIZATION9 platform so and the. So PERSON1 and PERSON8, what are your plans for this? You need to, well, we had the blocker with the goal language. And then you have in the end decided to do the recording separately. So the recording has not has not provided as much useful preparation, preparatory steps for this. So how far are you with the integration of the, or with the interfacing to the to the ORGANIZATION7 platform.",
            "But maybe we discuss, with technicality.",
            "Yes without developers.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so this is this is something which should be discuss a very soon, because there is limited time to implement it somehow, and also it's somewhat linked to the presentation, but I'm not saying presentation platform, but there has to be way in which the participants of ORGANIZATION9 calls could see the speech, translated. And one option is that a while having the ORGANIZATION9 call you would be also, you would have in another window, a web page that would use the presentation platform from ORGANIZATION7, and it would be looking at the translation in the presentation platform, from ORGANIZATION7, it is not a not a nice solution, but it could be the basics spoken language interface, it would be kind of available. It is not exactly in the platform, but it would serve the purpose. So that is like the fallback solution that you. So I think that for milestone four, what is absolutely critical. Is that ORGANIZATION9 sends the sound to the mediator and then the rest is kind of available. The better version would be that you are also able to connect with like to get the the text back, and to present text in some way within your platform, but I understood from PERSON14, a previously that this is not easy to do. So this would be like more more work. So please take notes on this and i think that please report to us during the next week, what the developers think about these these commitments here. So the minimum is shipping voice to the mediator. And will be, the users will be looking at the translation outputs in the mediator, sorry in the ORGANIZATION7 presentation platform which will be ready for the workshop at the end of June The better version is that you will connect, send the audio and also receive the text channel in some way. But obviously, it is a different setup than the from the one that we are normally using in our tests, normally when we connect this bit direction client, the Eb client. We send the audio, and we receive the transcript and or translation of that audio in your set up, you need to send your audio, but receive the transcript of other parties audios. And you don't want to receive the transcript and the translation of your own speech.",
            "I guess the best way would be if we discussed it with our development team, because I lean on me, both not developers.",
            "So if you need any technical call on this, please propose some dates, and I think it would be good, if PERSON10 was on those calls as well. Because she would know how different the set up is from the normal operation of the mediator, because the channels are now like mixing, you need to connect two half clients in in some way. Like one half client is sending my audio to someone else is half client who is this playing the transcript or translation of this. And I have another half clients running, which is showing the transcript from all the other parties. This is like the ideal.",
            "Okay, i understand the use case of actually i have to reason about this. Sorry i'm not able tell you right now if it's feasible.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Or how to arrange it.",
            "As i told you that the fallback solution, which should be okay for this, for this milestone. Would be that the all the clients, all the ORGANIZATION9 like all the participants in the ORGANIZATION9 call will be sending their audio signals to the mediator, and the mediator would be doing whatever translation is there, and it will be presenting all the speech in this single a presentation platform. So i would see also my speech, translated into whatever language i choose. And I would see what other people also said, so in the presentation platform that will be one page, one web page that I open next to the ORGANIZATION9 system. And then this single webpage, outputs from more sessions in the current terminology. So that needs a little bit of adaptation of the presentation platform. So does that make sense? So actually this is this is, we we we think that this is done, here some like deliberation on the languages covered is needed, but in essence we could claim this to be done. Cutting down on the number of target languages, but what is critical is actually, and what was the name, the name was basic SLT, so here, this is month eight, so for the month eight the fallback or minimum, ORGANIZATION9 clients sending audio to ORGANIZATION7 mediator, ORGANIZATION7 presentation platform allows all participants to choose language version of the transcript to follow, this transcript, this transcript needs to merge, trans, ASR outputs and translations from all participating persons. So that's the minimum, and it requires ORGANIZATION9 to send the audio and ORGANIZATION7 presentation platform to have that slight update that more sessions can contribute to the same thing. And the better version, ORGANIZATION9 runs two half clients, outbound client sends audio as above, inbound client receives text from other parties and is like labeled with party IDs, this is something which is important as well.And presents it somehow, and PERSON7 expects that ORGANIZATION9 will find this difficult, but please consider it anyway. Okay? So i think, we know some of that deadlines are totally okay, some of the deadlines are risky, and some of the milestones really needs good thinking and yeah. So ORGANIZATION9 and ORGANIZATION7 please let PERSON7 know in week how this was accepted in your tech teams. Yeah, okay, so let's move on further, publicity achieved, this is actually something which we are already collecting for it would for the mentioned that for the reports. And yes there is the video i think i've emailed everybody. So if you have any friends or colleagues have them watch this video, because the more views we have the better we feel, well i'm kidding. So, but any way we can make use of this video for for various purposes, so yeah. So the next point is the preparations for the workshop. We have spent, we are spending a lot of time on this. And thanks for all of you who will support us this is a really taking a lot of our time. And we were just on the edge off of being able to to do it right. And we need to keep running fast so that we do not lose that edge, and we actually deliver that. So the Czech ASR remains very risky it may not be there. And even if we do not have the Czech ASR what we will have for the workshop. So I will summarize it quickly for those who or are not present to our technical calls. It's workshop of about 20 participants. Everybody will be speaking in English, only there will have presentations some of them. Maybe there will be a related materials. We have a half-way ready platform for the participants to upload their supplementary files such as the presentations, and any other reports, we will make use of these files to possibly adapt the ASR to the domain. And sure, for sure to adapt the machine translation systems based on these text files, then at the actual workshop we will have for students of interpreting present, with four cabins of of these interpreters. There will be two respeakers cabins. So two persons will be repeating what has been said in English, and one person will be translating into Czech. And one person will be translating this Czech further on into German. We will have ASR connected to the English floor, the main input signal, the two respeakers, and then possibly to the Czech version, and then surely to the German version that they interpreted speech in German. This German is with the double delay, because it goes through the Czech interpreter first. And then from these ASR inputs will somehow, probably on the fly indeed and manually select which of these ASR outputs is the best one to feeding to, the machine translation systems. If it is from the English, then like directly after the ASR the empty the multilingual machine transitions system comes if it is from the German, then the German will first machine translated into English, and then from this English into all target languages, so that adds the delay, and all these outputs will be made available in the presentation platform. In the, this presentation platform is something which we still need to like discuss technically, but the participants will have their notebooks, this is something which which we have not discussed in detail. And the idea is that they will have webpage open. And that webpage will be the presentation platform, and it will show the streaming of the main slides and below that, below those stream slides. There will be the stream of the subtitles in the selected target language. So the participants of the workshop will have the option to watch the main screen and at the main screen, we will be probably presenting the English ASR subtitles, or nothing at all, and in on their screens will be presenting the, the stream diversion of the slides, essentially the same slide, but with a little delay. And then below that the subtitles in the language of choice, we are like, if we do, if our translations are totally bad, it is not a problem, because the participants don't need these subtitles. They are expected to talk in English, but we actually want the subtitles to be useful, because that is our serious important test for the for the Congress, which will come in less than a year after that. Okay. So this is the quick summary of what is what is planned. And, yeah, it is in preparation. Yep, so. And now on the work packages, do we really need to, to go over the individual work packages. Maybe very quickly. Just so that we remember the work package names. What is work package one? Is the data here, yeah, so data, and this is the minuting. Ok, so for the data here, the main thing will be the deliverable that describes the data we have collected for ASR, I would like to learn more about the progress of ASR, so take this as, please tell me know what is happening in your tasks within the ASR work package. So am I still sharing the screen, because the plan and the planning for this ASR packages, really free, we are free to do. Anything, there is no schedule for that. So I would like to know what is happening in the robustness, language model adaptation and lifelong learning.",
            "Fundamental experiment going on, they are working on completely new type model. PERSON7 I'm curious about this, this domain, the robustness, because there was a paper. I would like to find out for other purposes as well, which said, \"Essentially, if your model is huge, if your data is huge, you don't need to do any domain adaptation whatsoever. It is multi domain by default. I. S that essentially what your also confirming right,",
            "Nah depends on the speech recognition system we are using. So the hybrid systems that we are using in the stream, for the stream. Are not to mean robust, if you train on more data. You can show that these position of systems, actually suffer if you use more data. And only the new will end to end systems seem to be able the multi domain mix, and then are more robust to the default domains.",
            "Ok, that is interesting.",
            "The problem is that all these new end to end models can't be used in the slow latency run on ASR yet.",
            "Yeah. So they are a bit directional right?",
            "They are all directional that makes it difficult, so that it requires essentially tuning whether they are on possibilities to limit the sort of white context, the future context that you need, it's a good question whether it's or not, and then they are still behind and performances quickly, if you have strains on the computing power. It's super fast if you can run them in batch mode on a GPU, so for that processing that's okay, but you know for low latency, streaming processing even if you limit yourself at the lookahead that you do in the future, you might still have problems with performance.",
            "Yeah, and that is interesting, so that you obviously have like good progress, maybe like still open. Many open questions.",
            "It's okay, we may focus.",
            "Yeah, and for the lifelong learning, what plans you half in the long-term not necessary like for this year. Would that be some more learning from the input, as you process it.",
            "That's the idea that we learned from the input as we process it.",
            "So, this is in sharp contrast, with the current ways of training of neural networks. So, do you want to like to get some feedback.",
            "One is that we actually get human supervision, so that humans correct errors, and then the learn from these errors, and then hopefully you will be able to. So currently we are having a couple of students that are starting to work on that.",
            "Okay, thank you, so that's very interesting, everything. So you will have surely enough to write in the periodic report. Let's move on to work package on spoken language translation, looking at incremental decoding, altering results of decoding before full source sentences seen starting to implement the juristic okay. So this is the like we our research and innovation action. So this would be the innovation part. Do we have any research outputs planned or expected in work package three.",
            "Yeah, we have not really been progressing the research very well here. We have resourcing problems.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "So yeah, i mean, we are thinking of, we have been looking at transcript normalization, so we starts to collect some transcripts. But, that is about as far as we got with that. We started thinking about the incremental empty after the, the review, the feedback from the workshop around Easter, there is something we need. I think the the heuristic i mentioned is not. It was quite an early effort. So, oh wow you've got a misrange of the screens.",
            "Yeah, yeah sorry.",
            "But it is a starting point to see what I'm, see how it looks and see how we can progress that, looking at the output of your segment of the segmentery looks completely different to what I would expect it. So, I don't know, is specific error specific set up.",
            "We have like separate research results.",
            "I realize that, but I mean, in you know, in the research. You gotta make some model of what you expect to have the input to be in the system. And you know, there is in this early there is an expectation that you would just potentially you would feed in the words want of time, you would see the words one at a time. But that is quite different for what the way the output is appearing from the segmenter. You know, you got this output, and then suddenly it changes are. Suddenly it gets completely resegmented. So yeah, now there is a research question is to how you deal with such output. And I don't know, i'm not sure if it has been dealt with, maybe the sentence fragmentation trainees enough, for that. I have not seen enough testing.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that is that is more of the like segmentation issue. So that is a better integration between ASR entry. And do we have any plans for the end to end spoken language translation, i don't expect that you have done anything in the past.",
            "We have a student coming who is meant to work on this and this. And that is been subject to some delays, so he is supposed to now come in July.",
            "Ok.",
            "They are having delays. So they should have started few months ago,, yeah. But the idea is to start first July now.",
            "Yeah. Okay, and that's good though, thanks. And so I think that there again be enough to write for the report, so for the empty. So you have the a ACL paper on document level empty accepted. Thats perfect because we are experiments are like, inconclusive so to say, it is hard it's very hard to find improvements at the document level. We have tried some document level setups and we are describing those in the \"W\" empty paper, to be submitted as the system paper. But it is hard to, to convincing ourselves that it works well that it does something useful, because the it is to the shaded like these too many possibily references, the reference is no longer useful for the evaluation of documents level. So on be curious to read, what would you have done there to actually show that it helps.",
            "Yes, so we can find movements in terms specific phenomenon, like a translation of eliptical constructions, or consistent translations of names, and with that we could measure, the system does improve, and these test sets could also be useful for us in the future.",
            "Okay, yeah, so that is part of the ACL paper.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's good, you are better than we are. ORGANIZATION4 process of deploying transfer model. Ok, yes multi model setup, do we want to synchronize on this somehow? I have one student as I mentioned working on this, but his results. So far are rather negative that if if he has multi target systems, then it's decreasing the performance. And there is papers around would say that you should not be sharing everything in transform model. Atleast the final should be should be separate. So, i don't know if we want to write some join paper on this in one way or another, or if we proceed independently. So I'm too busy with the practical set up of the workshops to actually do any reasonable research in this area. That is, this will get somewhat better after the workshop, but if we can get some nicer outputs things to collaboration that would be useful. So yeah, please get in touch, I do not know who is it, is it PERSON5 in ORGANIZATION4, who is doing this.",
            "Not me personally, I think it will be to collaborate on a practical, because of very different frameworks and libraries and all that being involved.",
            "Yeah, so you are saying it is better to do work separately and have separate paper right, if i understand correctly?",
            "I'm not sure that this is necessarily the paper.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I don't think that is such development paperwork result from that, it's all been done.",
            "Yeah, okay, so that again the like integration part the innovation part. So you are improving your system so that they use the better transform models internally.",
            "Yes.",
            "That is the thing to report. Okay, so the baseline entry model this is the milestone, this is like the deadline month fix. And then the document level translation is something which should be spending over the whole three years, and then multi target is something which we will have still six more months to work on, and i hope to extract some useful outputs from the student of mine and also we should work together with ORGANIZATION5, because PERSON6 has these systems for his training. Now, the the single system for the what workshop. But I don't know if PERSON6 has any capacity for evaluating like, how much the performance goes down. If if they are more languages. Or if you are only training a single like single run, so what type of ablation analysis could you make not necessarily before the workshop, but like after the workshop and later on. And if we could collaborate on this in one way, or another.",
            "Sure, yeah, I think this will happen off to the workshop. Probably, but yeah, at the very minimum, I would be comparing the performance of the multilingual system against bilingual systems trained on the same data.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We are only dealing with fairly small sort of target languages, of the workshop systems at least. And so I don't think that is gonna have too much of a home full impact on translation quality.",
            "So we tried languages from the UN corpus. And there was always a loss in bless core compared to the ORGANIZATION7 models. Okay, yes, for the the workshop is a proof of concept. So, it is okay, even if the the bless course, are like three points worse, or maybe even five points worse. Then there will be separate systems would deliver. But we need to, like measure this precisely after the workshop, and then see how to proceed for the Congress. And the what is the final like scientific result from this as well. So let's plan to do more after the workshop and let's do it So this is something that PERSON2 should also like the be aware of helped me to to over to oversee this. PERSON2, are you here?",
            "Yes, I am.",
            "Yeah, so nothing is planned for the multi source for this year, and the flexible modeling release is still to come. For document level i've already mentioned that we tried some setups form for the the news task. And we also created test suit of the PROJECT1 document. So the, of the saw documents, and we are going to have evaluate this with the help of ORGANIZATION2 auditors and for English to Czech translation. I have like a mixed news, the systems appeared too good. So it is very hard to evaluate the outputs. That was on Wednesday, I was talking to three auditors, i was showing them the outputs of PROJECT3 and transform, and then output, and also of ORGANIZATION8 translate and they were discussing things, which are totally like irrelevant and not touched upon by the the training regime. They were discussing which synonyms are better to choose or near synonyms are better to choose and that for the area of value added tax. One particle translation is self of payer is acceptable and for their taxes, except for that other translations of payer are not possible. And and so on, there was also one case where two of these auditors said that they don't like some translation. And the most knowledgeable the third one said: \"No, no, this is a good translation.\" So you really need to be domain expert in order to judge the empty systems. So this is an interesting input for translation quality as a whole. And also for the document level setup. When we have big enough training data and good enough empty systems. It seems to be impossible to evaluate it and find a better system, and also find ways to improve on that. It is not that there would not be any errors. But it's that the errors are too scars and too different in nature. So there are only two errors that you could like work on directly. One of them is that the half of the second half of the sentence is forgotten, and you can check this was with alignment. And other repeating problem was that the abbreviations are wrong, but that's it. The other errors were really, and you have shortage of expert people to evaluate it. So you cannot do a large collection evaluation. So if you would evaluate many documents, you would then spot errors to repeat, but you do not have the resources to do that. And with small probes, you don't see any errors repeated. So I don't know how to proceed in the long term. This is an interesting like research problem. So, this will be our message for this in the various papers. Okay, so let's move on to the minuting work package, if there are no further comments or if anybody has anything to say to the little, like, the state of confusion of mine i do not know how to proceed with if the systems are that good. So for minuting we are mainly spending time on a collecting the data, and this schedule is something which I made up fully, when I was proposing the project. So will havea person, we have a person who is already working on like thinking about the models that could be useful for the meeting summarization. Will have one hopefully one summer interm to coming for this with some experiments. And I think that the main result of year one, will be the validation, of the proposed schedule. So I think it is quite possible that we will figure out that the separation, the stepwise processing. Would be different than from what I sketched, but we will have to have the reasons for for these changes. And so so, we are mainly collecting data, and we have some first ideas how to do the modeling. But we still have lot of time to work on that. Okay, then the integration yeah, therefore. So we have discussed this recording and in the ORGANIZATION9 at length. And we have also discuss the the upcoming milestone, so essentially these things. Someone wants to say something?",
            "No, sorry.",
            "So the, for the ORGANIZATION9 we know that Sorry? for the ORGANIZATION9 we know that we are like struggling for time. And for the ORGANIZATION7, this is the various outputs. And we know that we need to work on the presentation platform. So here, the integration for the purposes of meeting for the purpose of conference and workshop translations is forcing us to have progress. So I'm sure we will have progress there, my concern is more for the things, which do not have the exact the immediate use. And that's usage of remote meetings translation. And also, as the timeline says, \"The minuting demonstrator.\" And this is something which has the it is planned for the whole duration of the project. Obviously, we don't have any minuting prototype at all at this stage. Will have the best models, which will only roughly do something at the end of the project. But still, we need the presentation part of the demonstration, the demonstrator. So this is something which ORGANIZATION9 needs to like pick up again and think if there is some useful work. They should do during year one. For the minuting demonstrator, like what type of planning is needed to be done so that the implementation of the user interface does not have to rush later on. So for the minuting demonstrator i do not expect any software implemented in year one, but I expect the specification to be done within year one. So this is something that we need to synchronize with ORGANIZATION9 and start working on that. So PERSON8 and PERSON1 please please, take a note, again this can wait after the workshop. It's not critical. It can also easily wait after the milestone in month 8. After the spoken language translation like prototype. But we have to do something in this task by the end of the year. So it is totally okay to say in the entering report now that we have not started working on the minuting demonstrator because it is too early for that. B. Ut at the end of the year we have to have some thinking completed. Okay. Now, and for the dissemination, i think we are doing everything very well. And and, oh, yeah, there is one thing to to do. And that is this workshop for users. I think this is an explanation or some presentation of what we are doing. What is the technology for the for the workshop at ORGANIZATION2, and it is it has been planned for month ten, but it is actually happening in June. So we are totally over our capacity for thinking what should we present to the participants. So i would like to ask ORGANIZATION9 if they could like help us to organize the whatever we want to present. So the thing, that you will be one of the participants at the workshop. You would come there. You would be, you would come to LOCATION1 to discuss your value added tax topics, you will be given notebook by the organizer, and there hopefully would be the subtitles running. And there will be some limited extra time, very limited extra time. Where we could present the technology and somehow explain this. So could ORGANIZATION9 come up with some ideas for materials, so that we would then distribute them to the people, or whatever. We have the, but i think there could be something more. So that's, please ORGANIZATION9, have a look at the specification in here in the description, what we actually have we though of these workshops could be. The workshop in the middle of the project, the workshop at you site, something which is already being prepared. There would be a half a day workshop indeed. We will cover that, we will be presenting not only a speech translation, but also other language processing technologies. So the, this middle workshop will be easily covered. But I think that we need to have something to say that we have done, some type of dissemination at this June workshop. So ORGANIZATION2, sorry, ORGANIZATION9, please handle that someway, we are busy with the technical part. Okay, so here, it's like progress, well in various aspects all the time, but the most, so ORGANIZATION9 to organize plan how can we disseminate PROJECT1 technologies for explain, advertise, participants. So again, ORGANIZATION2 is listening, ORGANIZATION2 is still on the call, yes? But i do not hear anything from them. So it would be good if they were in touch with you. And if they confirmed what can we do at the workshop, or what can be done at the workshop. So, if you decide, so based on, based on the communication. Of the decide what exactly to do in this respects, and it may be useful for someone from ORGANIZATION9 to come to LOCATION1, but it may be not so it depends. It depends on what ORGANIZATION2 will say. If we are given a half an hour to present something, that would be good. But if we are not given that, if we can only like handout materials. Then there is no need to come. We can simply print the materials and give them all to people. If we are given this half an hour, i would probably prefer someone from ORGANIZATION9, to work on this presentation, because we will be totally crazy about that the technology. And this presentation can be broader again. It need not only talk about, what we are testing at the workshop. It can talk about the other tools that could be useful for the auditors, but please talk to ORGANIZATION2 if will be given this opportunity or not, right? ORGANIZATION9, so PERSON8 or PERSON1.",
            "Yeah, we got it.",
            "Okay, excellent. That's it.",
            "For the record i heard it, if it works, does it work?",
            "Okay, yes, excellent. So PERSON3, i have two questions, one of them or one is please synchronize with ORGANIZATION9 on the dissemination at the workshop. What options would be fine for ORGANIZATION2, and what should we do, what should we prepare for that. And the first question, which i asked at the beggining of the call is the data, the data recorded at the workshop, would they be useful, would they be available to the, and would they be also available for the public. Could we release them as the corpus later on.",
            "I'm still waiting to hear back from relevant department.",
            "Okay, yeah, okay, we would need to know this, when we are writing the data management plan, or the data deliverables. And obviously we need to know before the workshop. If there are any consents. That is important. Yes? So, that's if the relevant department says, \" Possibly, but the individual participant have to agree, then please let us know, and this has to be prepared in advance, so that we have the consent forms and all that. \" In the various the discussions that I had with the for example the director general for interpretation. I was told that the consent, personal consent is the weakest possible way of securing your data, that's actually the least preferred method, because the individual people later on. So there are better ways. If that is possible in the particle situation. So the best way is that people are forced by some law or regulation to provide the data of that kind, that does not apply in our case. The second case is that, the people do it as part of their jobs, so based on their like work agreement. They are expected to produce this data, and then the, their employer has the rights for the data. And I think that this in principle could be applicable. But this has to be like discussed if that is the case for the workshop for, and who are the employers of this. So maybe ask this question. As just an suggestion like how the data could be legally transferred to the, like for the use of the PROJECT1 project. If this work agreement would be available option or not. And if it is not the case. Then if we need the consents. And what the consents need to have. And then eventually, like if the final answer is, yes, you can use that.",
            "Yes, but first we need to figure out if we can actually share the data if they are perhaps it will turn out that for some presentation, that needs to be non disclosure agreement of some sort. All this need to be figured out.",
            "Yeah. We are happy for any subset of the presentations. So whatever you can give us that's fine. If you can give us small part, and you have, we have delete some sessions that's, that's totally okay. Okay. So thank you very much. I don't have any further questions, i'm sorry that it took so long. Somehow there is too many things to be discussed and done, but we have managed. I'm stopping the screen sharing. Oh, i'm not stopping. It doesn't work Stop present, yeah. Okay, so thank you. Please stay in touch, and keep up the good work.",
            "Thank you PERSON7, bye.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye.",

Yeah, so PERSON1 has worked on the whole set up,,, I was sure that we don't have the long microphone. Do we? No we don't. So, I'll try what what we can do. We could do. No that's for the playback.",
            "It's. That's for playback for a through a VDA. Well,. So, so PERSON6, the idea,, well we're still waiting for others. But the idea is that everybody organises the screens and we should do it as well. So that we will be watching the video in one window and have the subtitles and the,, paragraph view in the other window. And what is new is that,, for German, right? We have three,, for English as well?",
            "Yeah, for English and German.",
            "For English and German we have three different levels of flick,, of flickering,, so we'll see which of them we,, we like better.",

            "Yeah, yeah. So I didn't hear,, the beginning of your sentence. I think you were saying that you,, you prefer to have three different flickers in subtitling, and only one, the high actually.",
            "Hello. I I since, I'm not that good in German I configured my,, desktop,, configuration in order to have the three different English subtitle flickering times in the presentation platform, and the only one available in the online text flow. And I I cannot provide you feedback for the German one sorry.",
            "Yeah that's that's that's okay. It's just for our interest anyway. Okay. So we are still waiting for others I'm afraid. And I am in the.",
            "There is PERSON5 coming maybe. And we do not have our setup on the screen. So maybe if you could do the screen set up. Well, what we are watching. Do we have the the right setup? The video and next to the,, the.",
            "Everything is set. unintelligible >",
            "No, in this one. Because this one, this one doesn't need the pretty view. This one needs only to generate the sound.",
            "So, and I'll make use of.",
            "So, we will be sharing our screen then?",
            "So, this is this is for.",

            "Yes.",

            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's it. Yeah it works. There was that. What was it. Where is this place. How do I change. Extend. That's this magical button. Yeah. Because the \"extend\" gives us the high resolution there, yeah.",

            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm doing that.",
            "When do you get started.",
            "Okay. Let's let's redo it. First try whether it transcribes.",
            "Someone should be able to.",
            "To click into the different areas.",
            "At the same time.",
            "Yeah, so we,, so.",
            "And to make it easier for you. Just have to, click,. Just like press the space.",
            "Press the space?",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, so. So, three, two, one, click.",
            "Shall I pause it?",
            "Le let's pause it simultaneously. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So PERSON6. Are you, are you on the call or not?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Yeah. So we we had. We already started it here simultaneously for ourselves. And for the subtitling. And we did it as like a little test. But we did not synchronize with you, and also no one else joined the call so far.",
            "Oh, oh, well,, PERSON8 don't worry. Since through the Pick & See platform I heard you starting the video.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I also able to hear the the video playing so that I do not even need to play my own local video.",
            "Okay okay okay. That's. Okay, that's interesting. Yeah,. So our screen. I will try sharing the screen. What we are looking in, but that will be. Share my screen,, select window or the screen. Screen. Entire work. Do I, oh, the I'll share screen to. And that's the one, yeah.",
            "So if you see it now. This is our set up.",
            "Okay.",
            "And that's very cluttered. So we need to cut it down even for our assessment. So,. I don't know what we should avoid,. We should probably focus only, only on English. Right?",
            "And Czech, because you understand Czech.",
            "Yes. I would prefer Czech.",
            "English and Czech, yeah. So maybe if you can also share yours screen. So that we see your set-up.",
            "Yes, just let me check how I can do it.",
            "So the subtitles are ok. We can use many of those and here let's disable. What is this one I don't see that.",
            "Oh sorry, I'm. I'm not able to share my screen. But I can send you, for example,, any major. Maybe.",
            "So we don't switch. We know switched to two columns only.",
            "Both are like quite simple.",
            "How to share it. My gosh.",
            "Okay. Sorry PERSON8 I'm going to use also another,, different platform for sharing info. I'm going to upload in these live testing channel. My actual configuration if you are.",
            "We are not following site. That's one more thing where we could,, share things.",
            "Okay this is my setup. PERSON6's.",
            "We should add? That one, no. That one, yeah.",
            "Okay, so she sent her screen.",
            "Yeah. So I think. Your your screen setup,, PERSON6 is better then what we have because we have.",
            "Because we have like.",
            "Yes, but actually just because I focus only on English.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Yes, you will see I'm also trying to record some video here and there.",
            "Okay.",
            "Since we always need some some demo video.",
            "Yes, exactly that's. That is good. Yeah. So let's give it one more try with the,, so which video,. So,, so in the recording you will not have. You will have only the sound of the video that we play. If you are doing any re. But no, you are doing on the screen recording, no sound right?",
            "Exactly. If we need we can If we could-. try to synchronize the audio later Yeah, of course. since we had the.",
            "If we find it useful. Yeah yeah that makes sense. Huh.",
            "Just enable Czech and English in the.",
            "There wouldn't have. We don't need the video anyway like it's.",
            "I know, but.",
            "I will I think that we need more of this space and that is actually,, better achieved simply by. With. This, this is not disturbing much. The right one?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So. Oh. Double click it's too slow. So which one should I disable?",
            "Just refresh it.",
            "Okay. Refresh it and load. So and which Czech? This Czech?",
            "There is only one Czech.",
            "And English.",
            "So we should have E all of them, right. Three Englishes. That's it. Yeah. Yeah okay. And then we can. So this is probably the best set up that we can get. So PERSON6, I'll now. You see our current set up,, in our screen sharing. What I'll stop, stop the screen sharing, so that the the network is,, less,, loaded.",
            "I think PERSON4 is, should be here.",
            "Is he? I don't see PERSON4. Aha, tell him he is on. PERSON4. Are you there? So you about one, two, three, four right? So one, two, three, four is probably PERSON4. We cannot hear you. It worked with PERSON6. But,, PERSON6 tested,, it was good that we could hear,, that she could hear us. That she could hear us. She,, heard the video playing from our machine. Okay,, can you hear us? Yeah, so so if PERSON4 can hear us.",
            "And,, for PERSON4 I'll share one more time the screen. Screen number 2. So that,, PERSON4 knows what we are looking at. We, we are looking at different versions of,, English,,, subtitles for different flicker. And we are also looking at a Czech,, output. And in the paragraph you we have obviously only the,, the single view, there's no no need to change the, the flickering.",
            "So PERSON4 can't hear us.",
            "Oh, okay. That's strange.",
            "I think he can follow a chat when it's like.",
            "Yeah, I'm I'm using the chat window. So. Well, then the problem is that we we cannot really synchronise, with PERSON4 if he doesn't hear us.",
            "I think I can provide something in the chat window.",
            "Yeah. Oh, PERSON3 is here. Hi PERSON3, can you hear us? So we have PERSON3,, but. PERSON3 joined. Hmhm. PERSON3, please confirm if you can hear us. This machine seems overloaded. Do we have new charger? I cannot hear at the moment. Let me see. There is a. Yeah,.",
            "Okay, so PERSON4 has texted you.",
            "I know. And he says he is trying to figure out some,, setting in ORGANIZATION5. Okay, so can you hear us now? Yes perfect, and PERSON3? Are you here? So PERSON4 can hear us, PERSON6 can hear us. Yeah. PERSON3 has his cam,, switched off, that's okay, but if you hear. If you are able to hear us, then you will hear the French sound from the. That's what that's what PERSON6 experienced. She heard the the sound from the from the ORGANIZATION5 already.",
            "Do we also have PERSON5? I don't know. Yeah so,, that's bad. I cannot see video either, just loading,. Yes,, we are,, not yet running it. Running the video,, the video. But, try to change,, your settings so that you hear us. Okay, so let's give it,, three more minutes. And in three minutes,, we will start the video. And then PERSON3 will have only the chance to watch the subtitles. Don't get our sound by then, you will only be able to,, watch PROJECT1 platform. Or paragraph view. It is good to have the paragraph view open,, because it will collect some history for you. Avoid,, reloading in the history.",
            "Okay PERSON3 disconnected. And he is try. Yeah. So he is trying. He is working on the mics again. So I'm stopping,, the shir the screen sharing. That button. Yeah. And let's. So let's get started, right? So here is the that you want to watch. Is it the space or is it? So I'll just forge this space button.",
            "Space or click? Which will do it?",
            "Click.",
            "Click. So,, I'm stopping the screen sharing. Yeah. So, let's start PERSON6. So PERSON6 is here, hopefully PERSON4 can hear us now, I'm not sure,, and I'll start the playback and we'll we'll see. And we'll,, keep watching for ten minutes, is it?",
            "Seven minutes.",
            "Seven minutes. Yeah? The video for seven minutes.",
            "Yeah. So I'll add. Okay. Yeah, okay. So three, two, one, go. That's it, right? Okay. So. Yeah. I'll, I'll stop it. I'll try to stop it. Sorry. Ok, so,, who,, who we have on the call? We have PERSON6, who can speak, right?",
            "Yeah, yes, yes,, there was little lag. And we have PERSON4 who cannot speak, right? And we have PERSON3 and probably PERSON3 cannot speak,, either. Right? So PERSON3, and PERSON4, if you can hear us,, then write into the ORGANIZATION5 chat, that you can hear us. Yeah. So I don't know what. So PERSON4 is has disconnected. PERSON4 was not here. Okay. So the only,, -. The only person. Oh, he's trying to reconnect. Yeah. So,, PERSON6. Since we. Yeah, we'll se whether PERSON4 will be able to join or not. What were your impressions?",
            "Well,, I haven't looked at the video before doing this demo. So that I,, would like to,, understand what I'm really able to understand the from the automatic transcription and translation. I do not know, if you instead have the list of content presented? So that you can check me, check I understood correctly. But,, my feedback is that. The part regarding dif, I, I,, I identified at least,, three different news. The first one was related to,, COVID-19. They had a an Italian correspondent,, from a radio, or from a if I correctly remember,, and I probably there were the Prime Minister,, speech of the last days translated? I don't know. Translated in French. The second news. I don't get the topic. But it was a matter of honour,, between persons, I don't get the content. And I have to say that the last parter regarding,, the pension reform, was much much clearer. And I think I got the point. Regarding the,,, interface usability.",
            "Deep the fact that,, the presentation platform, not the world subtitle is displayed,, was a problem. Bec. I don't know, if it is a matter of resize of the window. But I think that in most of the time. And you can see it in my recording video. The second line of the subtitle. Was,, hidden,, in the black box.",
            "That means that means that you, yeah, that means that your font size was too big,, given our setting of the number of characters that we put into one line. So if you changed your font size, one level below it would probably have fit,, but the the the final,, answer is that it needs to be the logic in the browser,, that breaks the lines.",
            "This is was. This was a not that nice. I enabled all the three,, English subtitles flickering times. And I definitely prefer the third one.",
            "Which was,.",
            "It was the one, Which,, doesn't flick,, too frequent.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Regarding the online text flow.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I really appreciated the,, paragraph representation since when I missed some part. I was able to scroll and re-read what has been said. What I disliked instead is the fact that the gray,, and the not,, consolidated dypo thesis. Change is frequent, and it confuse me as, an user.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "It works pretty well.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the that's perfect, that's that's a perfect summary. And you were also, compared to me, much better in getting what's in the news. So, for me it was quite easy to follow some bits from the from the virus news. But I didn't get the details that there was some Italian correspondent from somewhere, for example, that,, I did not get that at all. I know that there was some number a of, a of dead people, and they were con like they were talking about,, how do we keep of trust between the government and the people. So they, they were, mainly ss preparing the the people, h, to keep the, to, to keep trusting the government. Because that's the only,, security that that you have, in the very changing,, situation. And. So this was that was quite,, followable for me. I didn't get the the Italian,, reporter. Then, there was something which I didn't understand at all, and I didn't even. So the you said that there was a topic that you did not follow,, either. You. And you identified there was it was this thing from the pension topic. I didn't even spot the the change from the unknown topic to the pension topic. So I thought it was two topics in,, in the talk the the the virus, and then pension, which was totally incomprehensible at the beginning.",
            "Well, we have to first check it. Because I'm not 100 percent sure that there were the three different topic.",
            "Yeah,, so,, we have to see what what was the problem. What was the,, the middle topic,, if it was something keywork that was missing, so that we didn't get it.",
            "Yes.",
            "I was lost for pretty long. Yeah.",
            "I think that there are some,, per person names. That we missed. And this probably made a mess in the translation issue.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so, so I also realised that when understanding. When trying to understand the text. I rely very much on my background knowledge. So that was the reason why I was able to understand,, the Corona virus discussion. And the,, the discussion about the trust between the patients and the doctors and the governments and, and the health care system and the and the citizens. Because this is like general world knowledge, and also, I have some knowledge about the area of the current situation with the Corona virus. Then,, I was totally confused doing the second part. And then as suddenly the the word pension appeared there. And that occurred to me that I vaguely know from other news,, that there is this pension reform that has just been been accepted in France, or or something like that. And there is a lot of,, negative,, response to that from from the people. And so there,, the key word in the in the output of the machine transitions system,, like started,, or brought all the little background knowledge that I have. And that suddenly helped me to understand somewhat. But I. Compared to you. I did I did I do not have the impression at all that I have understood the message. So I don't know at all what was the the message from the last part, I just realised that it is about pension reform,, pension reforms. So, maybe your background knowledge on that has helped you, or may I'm I'm like trying to figure out how come that you understood the last part so well.",
            "I get that, well actually, I know nothing regarding the pension reform. Especially the French one. If I, If I think that they are talking about,, a pension reform to be made in the next years. And why it's important to make it.",
            "And why is. Yes, why is so important to apply this new kind of reform and.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, so your background knowledge is not any better than mine. So maybe the error that I made was,, I was attempting to like catch up. So,, I was like scrolling little bit back and scrolling forward and,,, thereby I actually, disturbed my own concentration. So that's. I think that's the critical point if the user is fully concentrated on the paragraph view, not disturbed by the the gray flicker,, and only follows the content. Then it's,, it it works. You can get the message. But as soon as you as your thoughts wander, or wal like walk around. Or as you are trying to catch up with something. You immediately start losing,, the content. So,, this is different from listening to language that you understand. If you are listening to a language you understand, you do not need to pay attention to it. And still you get the recording, you get the transcript in your head. Here to get the transcript, sort of, you really have to read it. So that's, that's totally critical. And,, I'm wondering whether don't not in the not well for the Congress or maybe not within PROJECT1 at all, but whether it would actually make sense to to have your,, your mother tongue produced by machine translation, spoken to your ears. Which would relief your reading ability, and it would give you the chance to,, to like have this transcript,, collected in your head for free. In the same way, as as I get it, if I if I listen to, to the radio. But, yeah. That's a, that's just a side question. So,, essentially my messa and my, my take home message from the looking at the outputs is that I could not follow the subtitles at all, because we also had this font too big, because we were juggling with the windows. And in the second lie was, line was never shown there. So the subtitles were of, of no use to me, and even when when I reduced the font size. Still, it was jumping too fast. So I and I didn't have time to figure out which one is the lowest flicker, so that I could follow the the lowest flicker. I was,, mainly,, trying to follow the paragraph view and there it worked pretty well. But still, there were some,,, like ugly jumps. So what was not bad for me was the too many changes in the gray part. If the grey part is, two or three lines long. That's totally ok. But if the,, yeah if the greyish text becomes longer, then I suddenly start reading text, and then it can become disturbing. And the most annoying observation or most the annoying situation that I had was when this long paragraph, which was dark grey, turned black. And it made a big jump in the column. So that that unsmooth,, jump was was the annoying most annoying bit. But if I would decides to ignore flicker or whatsoever, then it's,, and so I would like actually hide it. So that's something that PERSON7 is working on anyway. To have just one switch, which would say, \"I do not want to see any of the grey output at all.\" if, if the gray output is is hidden, then I think that following the the paragraph view, is is easy. And if we do not run into the mistranslational or out of vocabulary problems, then it is really usable. So it is still needs the full attention,, but it is, it is usable. Having said that, the long paragraphs are still a problem. So we should really focus on the segmenter,, so that we have as small units,, of translation as possible. It must not be worse, obviously. But if we can go for clauses or something like that. Then it would do the best for for the user. Yeah.",
            "May I ask you to PERSON1 to share the piper used during the demo?",
            "Yeah. We can share the piper.",
            "Yeah, I I'll upload the.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And we also have comment from PERSON4 that the. He says that the paragraph view is much easier than the subtitle view. Because you can see the the history. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so,. I don't know if I understand correctly PERSON1 what you are saying. You are saying that, and nobody actually follows the subtitles? So.",
            "Many people. I have seen people watching different paragraph.",
            "Yeah, the paragraph view. Yes. So so far, we have very little. Yeah, okay. So PERSON4 is complaining about the the way the paragraph view moved without his control. So PERSON4 was obviously or that's my guess. PERSON4 was reading the paragraph view from the top to bottom,, and, he would prefer to scroll it manually as he reads. I guess. And maybe ga gather longer delay, compared to the original sound. Yeah, while the sub. The paragraph view is now, trying to keep the level. So it makes you. It makes it easier for you to to follow the most up to date,, the text, or most up to date information, and the history is harder to access. I think it is,, a yeah it is. I think it is it is possible it will. We will simply,, avoid the. We will disable the scrolling. So the new feature that could be considered for the paragraph view is that the scrolling will be fully manual. So you will be listening and you would be manually,, clicking scroll down, and the text will be growing at the at the bottom only. And if you stopped clicking,, then suddenly,, like you will stay at, on the page where where you are. So that's that's. This view,, this manual scrolling,, is good for people who want to follow everything. At the cost of,,, like gath gathering the delay and also at the cost of having to to manually,, scroll,, that screen. But but it's definitely not usable for any setup where you don't have buttons on there. Yeah I would have make summarisation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha ha, okay. So it works for PERSON3 now. So this, this room will get busy with students in fifteen minutes. I do not know, the weather ss, yes. PERSON3 I don't know whether your microphone works. Whether you can still say anything.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yes, yeah. Okay, well, you should have rebooted before, before the session. That's why I always use this this windows machines that I never use them for anything else but phone calls. And I regularly,, check for updates and reboot several times before the session. So I spend half half a day is just setting up the machine for the call. And that, and that works for. Yes. So PERSON3, did you have any chance to, to, see the subtitles, or the paragraph view during the video play back.",
            "No, I didn't see anybody,. I saw nothing.",
            "Yeah. So you didn't. You didn't follow the ORGANIZATION5 or the paragraph view?",
            "I was so busy to to work I didn't. Sorry.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,, so do we know how good the French ASR was? Yes,, we have no idea exactly. We have no idea. How good the French ASR was.",
            "Were you able to follow the talk or?",
            "Yeah that's that's what we discussed. So this,, this session is actually being recorded. So,, you can hear the description of PERSON6 afterwards. We will we'll share the recording of, of this. Because, PERSON6 was. She was pretty successful. I would say, like half way successful, which is pretty good.",
            "So I can I can say from this point of view like the the requirement that we had for the the development of this so far. So on like to translate usually the it shouldn't necessarily be so that you can just listen to, just read the transcription. And from that, you properly understand. The idea was always that these ASR systems were developed for us for the lecture translator. And for that it's like the students are sitting in the lecture hall. They can hear the the speech, which they don't really understand. And they can see the the presenter and they can read the transcripts, and from that all together from all those sources together, they will be able to to follow the talk. So. And I guess you have the original talk here as well, so hopefully that will be enough.",
            "Yes, except it was French. So, there it was a set up where I, I, yes I do remember. A couple of words where I understood the French word, and then I spotted it in the translation. Of so that that is so it is could be similar to the situation that you are describing. Where you maybe a little bit understand the original language. And I think in the lecture translator, if the lecture is on maths, then it's actually easier to to follow. Because there there the terminology is somewhat more international, than the politics or our, yeah, or regulations, and and management of of of health and the pension reform. So maybe the synchronisation with the unknown language, works easier for for maths. Yeah, listening to TV news without pictures is not always easy. That's that's what,, PERSON4 writes. Yeah,, so I had one more observation, and that was,, we are also planning to work,, on some censorship. So that bad words, do not get into the outputs. And this,, was planned to be particularly important for the high school students, but since the the fair is cancelled, because of the virus, then we are not putting any, any pressure on this anymore. But I realised,, here. It was in the middle part of the talk, where I didn't understand anything I just spotted sentence, where they said, \"the whole thing is managed by animals.\" And I don't know whether, whether this insult was really said in French or whether it is. So, I'm, I'm mentioning this because our censorship whatever it is, it will definitely have no chance in spotting,, such insults as \"the whole thing is managed by animals\". Yeah. Okay, so we've gained a few, a few new things to. PERSON3 we, we getting to see you. That's amazing. Yeah. So let's, les't digest what we have learned from this lesson. We'll share the recording of of this but it does not include the. So PERSON6 has the screen cast of the subtitles, right? So PERSON6's video in synchronisation with the recording of this call would be the best way to to look at it. If you want to replay,, replay that session,, just as a reminder of what we have observed. And,, what, how how do we proceed,,, in like with this goal in, in the future. So the goal of this of this French watching session, was to assess the real usability for the users. So how do we work on the real usability? We know how to proceed in ASR model improvements, in segmenter model improvements. We have gained a few tips for the user interfaces here, what to do. I think that the best set up, PERSON6 that you can. That you should focus on is the,,, is the combination of that paragraph on in the side pane, and then the video or the slides in the in the main pane.",
            "Actually, I can. I would like to test a different kind of a we already talk about it. Different kind of presentation approach,, which she introduced a small delay, but based on our experience, makes the subtitles be a real subtitles and much more readable,, for the end user. This is the reason I ask the PERSON1.",
            "The pipeline. For the pipeline would like to try to make some, some test. Maybe next week, or today. Let's see.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Yes. We are also going through the revision of the presentation platform. So this was really interesting also for the user experience of the web application.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So so PERSON4, PERSON4 was successful in finding the French original. Well, the the the surround script, I guess? As I don't, I'm not able to read it. And I don't know whether \"gérés\" means is governed or run by or managed by. I recognised the animals. And so maybe it was an ASR error. So, so, back to my question,, for the usability? How do we proceed with the overall usability. I suggest that not in, not the next week. But maybe in two weeks from now,, when we had gathered some further improvements again. Across the board. We should try another French watching session,, but we should focus on more things. A so. We should be better prepared in in the sense that we would, for example, be able to measure the ASR qual. We will know the ASR quality. So we should pick something where there is a gold standard transcript for the French, and. Yeah. So this is. Yeah. So the, so the next French watching session should be run on the test set which we have objective measures for. So that's, that's it. So we. This is what we are working on for the IWSLT shared task. To solve that's that's a question for PERSON3, actually, as well. Have you received the mail by PERSON2 and for PERSON4 as well. That we are like working, or putting together a submission to the share task, which I'm organising, and it is still not not not ready properly. But the PROJECT1 system should be evaluated by objective measures in in that. In English to,, Czech and German translation. And,, with these objective measures,, in place. We should run the next French watching session as well. So that would be French to Czech and German and English. For example. So another set up, but the same technical tools. And,, the we should,, use this for the next transition net next French watching session to establish,,, relation between our observation our impression and the objective measures. So that we know how good or bad ASR word error rate of of six is and,, how good a bleu score of of forty is. So whatever the numbers are. Yeah. So this is. Yeah. So let's let's let's plan it like that. Sorry?",
            "There is an alternative. Ant the others can follow.",
            "I I didn't get. Sorry because of the song, sound quality, so, no no no its its like. It's okay. But it is it is just speak slower. And the yeah that's it.",
            "Well, instead of having a talk with the gold transcript we could have a talking say in German or Czech. That someone wants to understand and the rest tries to follow and the native speakers can estimate how good the match to what is said is.",
            "So what you are saying, that native speakers would be watching the ASR and checking the ASR quality,, and speakers who do not speak the language would be checking the,, the translation quality,, but.",
            "But the native speakers can also check the translation.",
            "You can do it at the same time. So that's that's the problem of, of like,, overload of of the brain. But we have we already have a number of Czech talks that were transcribed. So,, we can. We would. Yeah, ee, we will figure out which which of the source videos would be the best. Czech could be an option because we have the transcriptions. If we find something from the European Parliament,, which is in French. Then we can do it there as well. And I would slightly prefer to follow a language that I do not speak. Then I. Because then I have the. Then I can make my own assessments as well. Yeah. So Italian. I would be happy with Italian. If we chose an Italian source video. Then we can also test Italian ASR. So this is something which we do not need for the Congress,, but we the that plan in PROJECT1 anyway. I think. Yeah. So I think that the the first set, we should try would be indeed,, French, because that is one of the languages we need. Or possibly Russian, which I do not speak either, and we also need it in principle. Yeah,. So, so, I do not see much benefit from your proposals PERSON3,, because it's the compared to my proposal, my proposal is to select something where we have the objective measures for. And I think we should be able to find something. You are probably proposing the simpler set up in case, we do not find anything with objective measures, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this room is it going to get students very soon. And I think that we should pack it here. And if you do not have any further comments now. Please still try to go over your experience and put that into the French watching,, session document. And we will share the recording of this ORGANIZATION5 call and PERSON6,, it would be great if you could share the the recording that of your of your screen with the subtitles.;",
            "Sure.",
            "And the I think that it would definitely earlier the regular PROJECT1 call. And there we will discuss whether we. When do we run the next French watching session.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So thanks to all of you participated,, and yeah it's it's always a new experience, so it's, I I like it. So thanks very much. And the next time will make sure that everybody reboots their machine a couple of times before. Before the call. This this machine is also asking for reboot. Okay. Thank you. Thanks.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Thank you. Bye-bye.",
            "Yeah."

            "Okay.",
            "But I may not get any Ip address on the wired connection. So we'll see and another reconnect with the unstable connection. Yeah, hello. I hope you you can hear me.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So, so sorry for it being like myself or not not, almost late, I'm on the Wifi which just when I started the test call, told me that it is unstable. So I'm trying to figure out how to get wired connection as a substitute and my colleague, is is helping me. So if I disappear. Then that that is my local. Wireless a problem. We have the slides shared. So that should not be too big of a problem for anyone to step in and present the slides,. But the the. The the the plan is that I will be showing the slides and scrolling them for everybody. And yeah, the, the the. The fallback should be only only, should be used only in case, when I disappear. So let me do one last touch of the slides. Because we have one more number for you. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I'm delighted to see all of you coming to our user session meeting,, thanks for joining's thanks for taking the time to learn about our project. If you have any questions. Please do not hesitate to just unmute yourself and and step in a ask questions to all of the presentations. I will keep my eyes on. The, the watch. So I'll stop you if there is not enough time for this length this long a discussion in the middle of the of the presentations. We will have another a block of a questions at the end of of the session. So don't worry to ask immediately, but be ready to delay,, your questions. For later, if if there if they become too interesting, and and too much time consuming. So, as as a set, I will be presenting the slides,. But I will not be a talking to all of them. There is many colleagues of mine from the project, so for the various work packages. It would be them who will be presenting it. And this. This whole presentation today is kind of an extension of a demo, which we ran for our project project officer. At the end of June. And so some of you who have attended that session we will see, the same demos, as we were showing a last time but what is new is the details about the work packages,. So this is definitely off interest. The audience today that is you. Is is also different. It's mainly technical people. So you will understand all the details that we do not even mention in the slides, and we are a here exactly to ask you for your advice like what what is the technical detail that you are doing wrong. What should be doing better. So please, please help us. Some of you are official members of the user and advisory board of our project. And some of you are, just here for this single session. So if you find this interesting. Then it would be good for us to, to invite you to this official board, but nothing more will actually happen then one more meeting of this kind in another year from now. So there would won't be any any other work load. So if you if you find that interesting,, then please, let us know, and we will have a list use, so that we have a larger user and advisory board. So, I think it is now the right time to, to start the presentation. And for that. I will share my screen. If I'm manage. So by the way, this session is being recorded. If you are a as a as an if you do not like, that fact, please let us know, and we will surely cut you out so that you don't appear anywhere in the recording. It's absolutely not sure if we actually,, actually published this anywhere, but if the demo runs well. And if we succeed in in the recording it. Then a possibly we may. We may use cutouts from this. Ok, so. I hope that you can see the the slide and when other colleagues of mine are talking I'll also try to put the slides to the ORGANIZATION4 document. That list the agenda, so that you can browse them in case if the connection disappears for you, and yeah otherwise, you will get the slides after the session. So the plan for today is to give you a brief overview of the project. In the remaining five minutes. And then to present the individual work packages. It will be always about five minutes of presentation per work package. And then there is a time for three minutes per each work package. Obviously, some of the work packages are more interesting and some of the are less interesting for you in in person. So we will just make sure that overall we finish this session a by around 4: 10 in LOCATION2 time. So in about a hour from now. And then the further interesting part comes, which would be the demos. The demos will be a live in the sense that not everything of the demos would be broadcasted through this ORGANIZATION6 interface. But we will also require your participation. You should be able and and ready to run your own web browser and follow the demo as it is being broadcast on the Internet. So as you will see how that works, but we'll. We'll get to that. So there will be two user interface is shown, and we will give you a brief description of the user interface before each of the demos. And as said, there is a reserve of 20 minutes, at the end of this tour slot for any further discussion. So, we have plenty of time. So, PROJECT2 is is a research and innovation project. Onto the horizon 2020, work work frame. And and there several topics that are the main aims of PROJECT2 is highly multilingual machine translation and speech translation, then document level mission translation. And we also have the goal of automatic, meeting summarization, which we call Minuting. ORGANIZATION12 is the coordinator of the project. And our research partners are the ORGANIZATION8. And ORGANIZATION1 Institute of Technology. We have one integration partner the company ORGANIZATION9 from LOCATION3. And one user partner, which is the company ORGANIZATION10. That's, one of the remote meeting,, companies many of you know very well. And we also have one additional user partner. And as the ORGANIZATION8 of the Czech Republic but, the ORGANIZATION8, did not want to get any single Euro from the ORGANIZATION14. So they preferred to have to fund their contribution to this project by themselves. So that's why they are going to kind of standing outside of the consortium technically but not workwise. So they are very much in contact with us. And, there are many research goals. But there is one main event around which the project is kind of center. And that belocks belongs to one of the two main use cases of the projects. We should be interpreting so live interpreting with machines at the ORGANIZATION2 congress. This is a ORGANIZATION3 of the ORGANIZATION7 and close neighborhood. And this Congress was supposed to be held in LOCATION2 in May this year, but due to COVID outbreak. It was postponed by one year. So, we would one extra year for improving the models, which is great. And so we are of very much hopeful that the ORGANIZATION3 will indeed take place in May 2021. I've already mentioned that it's a research and innovation project. So are you all know that some of the the aims that we have are mainly innovations, so just putting things to, to practical use, while some are a highly a unstable. It's not clear how things should be done. And that's the research aspect of PROJECT2. So machine and speech translation have been around for decades but the high multilingual research. Similarly for document level context, or, cross sentence context, there again. It's not a very clear yet how to do it reliably in in in large scale, and the automatic meeting summarization. It's something which is very new. And there we only plan to run a shared task. So define measures define task properly, and start the research in that area. We do not expect any working application. In pictures you know that that's easy. SLT is ASR + MT, and this AM is automatic minuting. We focus on number of languages. Our core languages are actually six English, German, and then Czech,, but we also cover French, Spanish, Italian and and Russian, and these are our ASR languages. And then for machine translation we again, focus on English, German and Czech primarily but our systems handle all European languages. And experimentally we are trying to cover all the languages that our user partner needs. This ORGANIZATION2 languages are 24 EU + 19 additional languages. So Albania and Arabic many of these are a very high resource, very, very much low resource languages. And some are not clearly defined from the linguistic point of view, either. Such as this Montana green, or or others. We aim at helping ORGANIZATION7 that are in the, European Association of of them. But we also aim to help, you institutions across the EU one of the prime possible partners. There could be the DG the director the gen the director general for interpretation, then possibly international companies, a local companies for easier access to cross single communication. And then possibly end users. What comes now would be the presentations of the individual work packages. And this is the overview of the work packages. We will start with the work package on data and then proceed on to the work package of speech recognition then spoken language translation, which is the combination of, ASR, and MT. The details on machine translation would then talk about work package on automatic summarization of meeting. And we have also a presentation on the integration, which is a very important aspect of of this. We are not covering management and dissemination. But we have a few slides on ethical issues, a new work package was added to PROJECT2 by a request of the ORGANIZATION5, because we are gathering data, and we should handle the providers of the data properly. So now we are moving to the work package on data. And I hope that PERSON1 is here and can unmute himself.",
            "Yep, I'm here I hope you can hear me.",
            "Yeah yeah and I'll be moving the slides for you.",
            "Okay, good afternoon everyone, my name is PERSON8. And I'm from the ORGANIZATION8. So I'm gonna be talking about work package one which is about data collection. So this work package plays a central role in project. And because it provides the other work packages with a training and test data that they use for building their systems. And for doing research. Some of the data. We produces curated from existing sources some of it's completely new. Wherever possible we released the train data publicly, and we also release test sets. So they can be used by the wider research community. Now have five minutes. So I'm gonna talk about just few highlights, and then briefly mention some ongoing work in future plans. OK, next slide OK so. So which trying to sport, huge number language pairs so there are the seven I ASR languages 43 target languages and as far as possible we trying to support every every single pair. We were also interested in a very specific domain, the domain of order. There isn't in domain parallel corpus so we can't just go out and download a data set. So first of all what we've done is to try to cover as many language pairs as possible using data for any domain and any genre. So great resourceful machine translation is which is a huge collection of Polo corporate covers hundreds of language pairs and cover the range of domains and genres. So there are translations of the bible, subtitles from movies, elementary proceedings and so on. So what we've done is we sampled a large multilingual parallel corpus that's suitable for training the projects initially empty system. So in first version we to million sentence pairs for every language pair, covering most of the the projects pairs. We used for pairs with less data and this gave us a corpus of 200 and 26 million sentence pairs. A variant of this is called opus 100, and it covers a slightly different and slightly more diverse sort of languages, and we have used up from research. And that is actually now available. As part of of opus collection. We've also been working with an extended version of the data set to remove this artificial one million sentence pair limit. And we used that for training some of the MT systems that you will see later on in the demo. Next slide. Ok so opus can give us plenty of data, but it's out of domain so for in domain data, we have to cool it and prepare it ourselves. So there is an other EU project called Paracrawl which is specifically focused on cooling a parallel data from. And we've been using version of their cooling pipeline. So we started out by collecting data from the website, ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION2. That's given us a monolingual data covering 24 languages, and some languages we were able to extract lots of data. For others it was bit more spots. On an average we gotta of 40 000 sentences per language. We now applying similar approach to extracting parallel call pro, and we are using the reports from the website of the European court of auditors. So this is great resource, because the majority of their reports are published in all 24 official EU languages. So far, we've extracted to pairs including English. And that's giving us really good. So on average 280000 sentence pairs, per language pair. And we are now working on the on non Englishness. Ok as I said to stop we are trying to release training and test data where possible. So at least the test set is a GitHub repository. Where we collect data that we use to evaluate ASR, MT and SLT systems. This is a public repository, and we want other groups to adapt our data. So we spend time making sure everything's in a consistent and convenient format. Currently consists mostly of Czech, English and German documents,, but the goes to represent all of the PROJECT2 languages using in domain and general recordings and texts. Currently we have over 16 hours of recordings of original speech 150 original documents, witchery, the written or transcribed from audio sources. Most documents are also translated or live interpretation. And in particular we've been using this for evaluating on existing SLT systems. And as losing proof will be able to provide measurements of the progress. And we can be working on expanding this data by providing additional translations and languages. Ok. Next slide. So in terms of data automatic minuting probably the most challenging task in the project,. As there are very few pre-existing resources. So we've been collecting and annotating data, pretty much from scratch this involves making audio recordings of meetings like this one and producing transcripts and then collecting it up pre-prepared agendas and meeting minutes. And then we annotate the status so the main idea of the the annotation here is to connect segments audio recordings and the transcripts with the corresponding items in the meeting minutes. We've been collecting data from our own meetings as well as other EU projects. So far we have approximately 92 hours worth of meetings in English, 50 hours were I think Czech. In the English meetings, most of the participants are non native speakers. So this makes it really challenging data set for ASR. This corpus is still under development. So far it's been used as a test set for preliminary experiments in meeting summarization. We continuing to collect and annotate data. I just like to highlight that there is actually open for data. Here you can see the link to the local post. Of the PROJECT2 website on the slide. We're hoping to collect recordings and minutes from even more even more sources with a view to running a shared task. And if anyone here attend regular meetings, the the on confidential. And the come with minutes and may be able to share that data with us that would really help us out. So please get in touch K. And final slide please PERSON6. So yeah, I just quickly mentioned some other works. We have some recordings in transcriptions from Czech national radio. Last time, I checked that was about 250 hours worth, I think it's probably more. But now we are also working on the, mostly parallel corpus of speeches transcripts translations and interpretations from the ORGANIZATION11 plenary sessions. Covering 2008 to 11, so that's where translations into all of the EU languages were available. And of course for the, automatic minuting in denying MT and PROJECT2 test set. They sort of talked about already the work is ongoing, and we are continuing to gather more and more data. Okay, so that is all for what package one. If there are any immediate questions. We can take them now, otherwise later.",
            "Yeah, thank you PERSON8. So, if you have your questions please keep them for a later, rather. And let us move on to the ASR just to be on the on the schedule. So the ASR should be presented by PERSON8, right.",
            "Yeah, hi hi everyone. So I am PERSON8 from I work package two. So that we we want to sequent to sequent ASR systems. The reason is that the current system we had it's ASR system. And in order to be we had to follow. Which included several components and require different expertise. For example I I need to to be ASR system for Czech. And we yeah, it it the system is not optimal because I don't know the Czech language. And yeah we want to sequent to sequent models to it offer end to end so if it's. Putting one sequent model to to text sequence. And yeah more important it it had better performance, and to be we want to consider two setups. One is very good to apply system. And the sequent is online setups sequent to sequent model to perform low latency streaming for the spoken language translation text. Next slide please.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I would like to present. Investigate two sequent to sequent models one is and the other. And the thing we sequent to sequent model it's to the data. And for that we two data yeah it it. Sub sequence sampling. Yeah we we have run on telephone. And at the final result we about our with 2000 hours training data and yeah this is. On the text. And for apply setups we also consider to sequent to sequent model to perform in. But it had several components had latency problems. For example if we sequent mode with scans it always scanned. And also the standard to the size and it's all sequent to sequent models walk in in in not in low latencies. So if we to achieve it had to complete input and it not low latencies. We propose some to to sequent to sequent model. Additional lost to not user fans. And the second thing we propose is stable hypothesis. Again we had done the on telephone both latency and. And would mention here is that the with two second delay the the online system can put you the same as the.",
            "Yeah okay. Thank you. Are there any questions to the ASR work package or should we delay them as well. Timewise we are just on the schedule.",
            "Yeah quick question PERSON8, what languages were you trying on the telephone.",
            "Sorry English?",
            "Oh it was English telephone speech, okay.",
            "I think it we English with 2000 hours.",
            "This is this is this is the standard switch port home call test set. So it compares to other numbers.",
            "Yeah okay, thank you. So let's move to the next work package which is on spoken language translation and you will hear about the machine translation only afterwards so this is like in the middle we put it as as number 3. And I would like PERSON7 from ORGANIZATION8 to to present this part.",
            "Oh hi, it's PERSON7 here okay, so I'm gonna talk a bit about it what we are doing in spoken language.",
            "PERSON7 could you move closer to the microphone?",
            "Oh okay, sorry about that. Can you hear me better now.",
            "Little bit.",
            "I can try different microphone.",
            "Oh yeah. So just move the microphone closer to you.",
            "Does this sound better?",
            "Yes. That's much better.",
            "Okay. I've changed microphone. Okay so as PERSON6 said spoken language translation is about basically about how we put it together. We've got ASR and MT work together better. So here is the kind of motivational slide, the ASR let's say it produces an imperfect transcript and then we have to use MT to try produce hopefully a perfect. So next slide. Yeah so this is the way we kind of setup the project we assume it was 3 different research areas. The first one is essentially take the ASR output and make it look a bit more like what the MT is used to seeing, so kind of normalization. The second one is well okay it's kind of the other side of that is like make the MT more robust. To dealing with this noisy ASR output. And then the last direction we are looked at is basically well can't we just skip the pipeline all together and build a model that goes straight from the way formed the foreign language output. Okay so next slide. Yeah so when we started putting things together at the beginning of the project one of the things that was clear was the ASR works online as we heard. And it has this this this property where it produces the incrementally on them, and can alter. We would like to make the MT work better with this,. There is a couple of problems, firstly that the ASR output is obviously changing. So what we do the with the MT on more seriously the MT. The segmentation is changing. And. So traditional text-based MT works segmentations changing and you could be real problem,, and were like, well, shouldn't this spoken language translation also be online helpful. Okay. So we move on. And once you start thinking about online spoken translation. You realize that it needs to be evaluated somehow. So, and this has been. There is been a bit of attention on this in the last couple of years, and is basically three different dimensions that you would think valuating this online SLT. The last one quality is kind of clear. One thing is maybe not quite clear is we only because we have these other two evaluations. We only evaluate on full sentences. Sorry about that. So the other two items so latency based means that this shouldn't be an delay, and introducing the translation. You got someone speaking. So you want to actually produce the translation quickly. And the PROJECT3, if you try to produce the transition too quickly. Then you sort of the system may change his mind and want to rewrite. So this latency and PROJECT3 are both sort of user interface issues that we have to think about and hopefully find a good tradeoff. Called SLT F and task we run. I did apply various different ways of measuring these these three dimensions. Ok, next slide,, also thinking about on my SLT. Theres really two kind of you can split the ways of doing it into two. The first method, which we can reach translation, which is actually what we do is the simplest method. Basically you get the output from ASR you feed an MT into MT. And each time you get an update you just retranslate. You do not retranslate absolutely everything. Once the ASR stabilizes you just assume it's okay. And then, you just retranslate back to the last the last stable region. This is nice, cause it is very simple. And you can use any you want. So we must use PROJECT1 in production, which is really fast. The other side of that is the streaming idea on in that you basically have to have some kind of modified, you do not have your ASR MT working a bit more. And the idea is that the MT system can either decide to translate produce some output, or can wait for the next input from the ASR. We used the retranslation. And we are using in production with a long latency, as you will see, because we think PROJECT3 is bad. But let us move on. Next slide. Yeah, so we have done a bit of thinking about how to improve this real translation approach. This is some research that we've done. But it basically stems from this idea from a group of researchers at ORGANIZATION4, who produce this this. This thing called Mass K., which says, when you do retranslation. You don't output whole sentence, but you mask the last few tokens so that the translations is always slightly behind. You to produce to tradeoff latency and PROJECT3. And it does not affect the final quality, because when you get to the end of sentence, and you just output everything. What we did was introduced a twist on that where we set this K dynamically, and how do we do that. We look at the incoming source. And then we try to predict what might come next, and we can use a language model to do this, or we can actually just add some random words, using sampling,, and then we translate this longer section. And we look at this stable we use is to get a measure of instability, the translation. So that change then we'll do some masking. If not then we were more conference make an output. And using this with different strategies. We can get much better tradeoff between on latency and PROJECT3. Moving on. What I have talked about so far has been on this pipeline approach where ASR and MT are separate. There is been a lot of reason interest in what we call end to end SLT. And this has certain promises. This is basically what we do is ASR and MT in one model. And the promises of his. It promises simplicity, maybe, and it should be more efficient, and it. Should we hope improve the coupling between the two models, because most of the work of talks about has been trying to figure out how to make MT. And as our work better. We can train together. Might we get an about model. We have done some research into this. We have not had in production. So some of the research highlights could make some improvements to the architecture and actually multitask training. We are using and we we, also looked end to end SLT, and and actually on un-segmented input, and also sort of hot warehouse we use when we make representation. So a move on to the last thing is this sort of the things that we are currently fighting with. We do. We do have this issue where we in the live system. PROJECT3 seems to be quite bad for users. Maybe it is better to translations better, reduce the cognitive load that we saw was that moment having large latency. We definitely find the MT degrades too fast when the ASR degrades. You know, for example, just because bad ASR, and most the segmentations very disruptive for MT. So we need to figure out some way of doing that, but and also related minded. When the transcripts are relative quality, the fact that there are two long makes it really difficult to read. So when you questions as to whether, end to end SLT will address which is what we want focus on it and the second half of the project. So I'm going to end there.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. Very. So. Is there any questions? You can ask immediately.",
            "Yeah quick question for PERSON7 dimensions of evaluation slides.",
            "Yeah sorry.",
            "I got a sense of how you might evaluate latency and sleep quality is quality symbol, and what about how you want to quantify PROJECT3, because I did. I thought might.",
            "Yeah, sorry, about that the idea. PROJECT3 is basically how much the translation changes meeting updates. So if you if you remember what I have is live with the the ASR output. I mean, this is ASR. But it's the same idea translations, you get rewritten. So as the use of looking at it in words, be changing on the screen on, because MT includes reordering that can be moving around. So it is just measure how much did change the translation changes between updates. And the only stand. Then you essentially get no PROJECT3 because translation does not change just extends does not.",
            "So some kind of. New things okay, under past. Okay.",
            "So the the way I think about it is also the wasted effort in reading. Yeah, some of the edit's in the past may be disruptive. And then you have to reread all the thing from the past point, till till the current point. And sometimes the edit's in the past would be, just smaller fixes. And actually in that case, you would better and not show them at all, so that the the the the the letter stay in their current position. So there is wasted effort. Another idea. How to think about it. But, there many ways in which you can formalize that, and obviously these measures will have different outcomes than.",
            "Yeah and for later discussion that that any psycholinguistics studies that see how much.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah, let's talk about this later. And let's move on to. If there is no other urgent question. Let us move on to multilingual machine translation,, which is work package 4. And here, the presentation would given by a student and colleague of mine, PERSON5.",
            "Hello, so I'm going to present you work package 4 multilingual machine translation. This is the overview. Next slide please? So the first task, are baseline models, and we had to provide, machine translation models, between 4 to 3 ORGANIZATION2 languages for the needs of of the auditors on the Congress. And also us, us a baseline for for the research, and we have either bilingual models dedicated for some higher source language pairs and multilingual models. In the the single decoder model as Johnson. They are trying with mixed multilingual training corpus. We targeted that their mind by a special token, and they are. Some of the models are English centric and their trying on data from opus, and for zero shot language pairs we use either Pivoting Pivoting via English. Next slide please. The other task is document level machine translation, because the standard in machine translation today is that it translates single sentences, very well, but it just does not handle cross sentence at all. And this may be crucial for spoken language translation, which many referential expressions, the challenges, and some tasks are criminal terminology, and evaluation. Cause current matrix are designed mostly for single sentences. And for that we, we propose to test suite from the document from ORGANIZATION8. at WMT 19 and. And a WMT this year. So we translated many documents by orders submitted systems and evaluated them manually. And we figure out that expert knowledge is necessary for the quality assessment, and that document specific terminology in machine translation is is disaster. The translation systems may handle the terminology, which which appears in common. But if anything must be by the terms, which which appear only in some documents are disaster. And this year we. We have another analysis on the review. Next slide please. We have two works to publish papers on context around machine translation. Next slide. Please.",
            "Yeah, Yeah, just second, or yeah.",
            "And the other half of this work package is multi target machine translation. We we are researching it for efficiency. We want to have one neural network which translates into several languages at once. So we don't need to have many networks. The other focus is on multi source translation and we. It means that when we have some when we have parallel documents. We can use them to improve the quality of the translation and translate them from several parallel language sources at once. And the and the last focus, is flexible multilingual machine translation for versatility. And it must be flexible on missing sources and and the targets must be optional. Next slide. Please. This is this is about recent work from our colleagues from ORGANIZATION8. They. They propose of way to improve multilingual machine machine translation. With random online backs translation of the zero shots directions. They. They train, it on 10000 language pairs from from 100 on a 100 languages from opus and a they narrow the gap on zero shot, compared to Pivot based translation from seven points to one points. And this paper was published at ACL this year. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, so that was the work package on machine translation. And we can directly move onto minuting. If we have to present it here, or you can also ask questions now. So I hope PERSON11 is here. PERSON11?",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah okay. So again, I will be moving the slides for you. So we now move to the summarization of meetings.",
            "So hello, this is PERSON11. So here we have a mockup of typical scenario we are working for. So we have many participants that are the. So they are discussing of several topics that they have to agree upon. And of course first we have the the speed recorded. So we have automatic speech recognition and the transcript the the transcript. And and of course we have to. So take out of the the conclusions of this transcript and put them and create a minute. So the the the the the the the gel in sheer excuse me. Okay no problem. So I was saying that the the the challenging part series. So you are moving back and forth those.",
            "There is a delay so I have to click next slide before you say it.",
            "Okay, so anyway no problem. The biggest issue here is the red, a real minute from the transcript good minutes from a transcript and populate the agenda. So populate the agenda topics with the corresponding conclusions of the minute. Okay now, next slide please. So these be big task of automatic minuting. Easier to break it in 4 steps, first to break the transcript in segments like, clusters. And the discuss the same agenda topic. And next kind of summarization in the sense of we compress the sentences spoken language. That probably are there are still there. And the next step we performed the the main summarization like trying to to cut then to extract then put together the different conclusions of sentences. Forming the minute. And then the final step. We we try to match all this conclusions with corespective agenda topics that are pretty fine. Ok next please. So this an overview of the overview of the the whole task of the minuting module. And next please. So first in the lap we have the inputs that are a game a the dialogue transcript. That comes from the automatic speech recognition and the MT agenda in the sense that that has only the closes. The the discussion topics without any real from the the the. So next please. And in the right. We have the two desired outputs. We have the minute the entire minute of the meeting with the dialogues with the including remarks. And then the filled agenda, which is supposed to have the the the the the the use the topics and the conclusion remarks for each of them. Next please. So now, first of all, we tried to kind of shortcut this chain of so that we could see like is it really reasonable to further break the task in force of tasks. So we try to come to get the summarization that dialogue the summarization of the minute from the transcripts directly without segmentation and segment summarization. Routes, the army segmentation and segments. The results were very poor. And this is how somehow justifies the our first of all, the first way we conceive the the the the module. But it does not really mean that there is no way to do it. As as a single with the single model with a single big model that would somehow consider all the the the aspects of these tasks. So next please. So going on to our to our initial design. So first we have this the first is about segmentation. So here we tried learning models to kind of cluster together the different sentences that are somehow related. So first we break the and then we somehow together. We have this task is somehow looking well in the sense that the different the different outlines that we tried with each other. Especially when measured between of each of each of the of the transcripts we were using. Next please. Next we have the segment summarization. So here we have different segments of clusters of couple of sentences like for or even like up to 10 sentences. So basically this task is very similar to to sentence compression in the sense that are or other tags of supervised learning the the models like to to to decide which of the works of phrases are redundant and the removing them. Once again this this task is also performed in a supervised in a supervised form like the the. Next please. So here we have the most important subtask that is the dialogues summarization. From the moment we are trying the transcript. We are experimenting the with big models that are based on exactly which is an extractive model. So we need big data like large data collections and we are actually. And for the testing we are using less the answer either the Axel supervise learning the models like let us say, \"I'm sorry, you lose. So, to decide which of the words or phrases that about her down and the moving them to the matter dropped from the the the last, once again. The this is just use those or reform dinner and supper, rice the nuns arise form with the with the existing data like there are the latest credit for next maze. So here we have the most important. Combination of to popular data sets in the minuting research. And the once again the here we get one of the first the output of this first subtask is the the first is one of the outputs the of the model which is a dialogue minute. And finally next please. And finally as the next. So here we take the from the dialogue from the minute from minute from transcripts minutes, and try to match them with agenda topics in the best way so that we have completed agenda as the second output that we need. Next please. So finally we have some preliminary scores, unfortunately from. So as you can see our current our current prototype reaches up to 16% in. About 4% in and about 14%. So this is typically low summarization score in terms of as you should know can be highly deceptive in some cases. Especially higher scores quality. And here we have the reference in the candidate sample that the an output sample, the reference is remote only controlled television so is very concise conclusion or decision or discussion. And the candidate is somehow longer so. So if we have a careful look in the candidate it is somehow able to to kind of represent the the reference with special different terms. But the the real problem is that it is not beyond expanse beyond the the the required reference. And this is attend that we have observed in our current results so this is exactly what we need to improve to improve in the future. So we'll try to reach the size summarization outputs especially in the 2 second in the in the in the last two subtasks that are the compression and the summarization and the minute summarization. So next. That's it from the moment, I guess that.",
            "Yeah thank you PERSON11 and sorry about the mess up with the slides. So if there are any questions to summarization you can ask now. Or we can move to the integration and deployment, and here the presentation would be given by PERSON3, if I'm not mistaken.",
            "Yes, hi I a PERSON3 and employed in ORGANIZATION9 an Italian company of automatic speech recognition resolutions. And for the PROJECT2 we are. This work package addresses the aspects of the integration of partners services. And to provide end to end workflows for the usecases of the project. Next slide please. Thank you. The PROJECT2 project mainly focuses on two different use cases. Face to face conferencing which means to interpret let's say frontal speeches and the workshop style discussions. And remote meetings, which means to interpret discussion an online platform. Today we will focus just on the first Usecase, but it's important to notice that we achieve both of them, relying on the same back end infrastructure, which is the ORGANIZATION9 service architecture. Okay thank you next slide. Partners independent services and then integrate them using preshared library which manage the communication protocol. Toward the centralized coordination point which managing the workflow orchestration. The advantages of a system of this type are many but probably the most relevant one. Are the independence of software components, and the possibility to distribute and to replicate the services to provide the more robustness and to increase service bandwidth. Upon on this infrastructure next slide please. We develop our presentation layer integrated with the ORGANIZATION9 service architecture to provide live transcriptions and translation to end users. And ORGANIZATION12 developed the online text flow of application. Which provide multiple simultaneous and transcriptions and translations in paragraph view. ORGANIZATION9 developed the presentation platform web application which provides multiple simultaneous transcription and translation in subtitle view. Together with slide streaming. Of both of the views you will an live demo later. Okay next slide thank you. The PROJECT2 project started in January 2019 2019 yes. And we have done many events since then. After 3 months from the beginning of the project we had the first dry run event. And in particular last year we managed to ORGANIZATION8. events one in LOCATION2 and one in LOCATION1. Next slide. Okay here you can find a couple of recordings of past events. And next slide, thanks to our project leader who encouraged us to test and measure our progress, we have collected a lot of lesson learned and user feedbacks. And starting from then we are planning infrastructure next step and evolution. For example next slide, thank you. The presentation platform restyle, we would like to take into account user needs to maximize video player slide content. And possibly achieve mobile friendly design. Next. Okay. The well the COVID situation impacted our plans, a lot of planned events have been canceled, we we probably prepare some extra tool in order to be able to not only cast local slides, but also on demand remote videos. Unfortunately of course this is not enough to restore normality. In any case we look confident and hopeful to 2021 we would like to plan some new events but in particular the next year we will have the main project event which is the ORGANIZATION2 congress. And of course as usual we are pleased to receive your suggestion for other events.",
            "Okay, thank you PERSON3. So if there are any questions on integration then you can ask now, you will also see both of the user interfaces mentioned in the in the demos after the last presentation. So the last presentation will be a little shorter it's on the work package which has been added on request by the ORGANIZATION5 it's on ethical matters. Here the goal is to setup procedures for recording and handling the data and that's mainly for the minuting use case, because we are not we don't have the funds to create large speech recognition data sets and other other data sets. So mainly the minuting data which is essentially non existent or or there are corpora for project style meetings out there and for one of them two thirds of the recor of the meetings are actually mock meetings acted by by people and not not real meetings. So we are gathering the data of, for example, from all project meetings of ourselves, and this needs to get the, the ethical matters correctly. So there is some formal structure behind this work package. So there is a person who has the the position of being the data protection officer, and she should be double-checking, what we are doing. And we have project committee. In case, we do something wrongly, or we are not sure how to do how to handle of a particle matter. We have a few experts in in the area that we can consult. The activity is primarily the technical one, so collecting consents from human participants, and then specifying the procedure. What to do with the data after we record them and the outputs formerly are three deliverables. And these deliverables are to be public. And the last one will be updated to the end of the project. So ideally, they should serve as code of conduct for other EU projects how the matters should be handled. So for collecting consents. And this is remember this is recording meetings like project meetings. We have two stage agreement. So first, we contact the meeting organizer, and he has to approve that the meeting in general can serve this purpose. And the we if if that goes through then we will get in touch with every participant of that meeting, even after the meeting with those who were unexpectedly joining the a meeting, and they have to agree that their contribution to that meeting can be used for the purpose. And in order to,, be able to maximize the data that we gathered this way. We ask both the meeting organizer as well as the participants about a level of the data usability. So there can be many possible configurations. But we came up with this single one that can serve as an example. So we ask the question, you are providing the data to us the data that that we get from you. Can be then publicly released after day identification,, when we do all the the edification that we can. And can we release it during or after the PROJECT2 project, so like, can we release it immediately or can we release it only with the delay starting from starting from like two years from now or maybe 5 years from now. So we believe that, many of the project meetings are very much sensitive and confidential today, but they will be less so in five years from now. And therefore we we assume that the participants would be more willing to agree with this delayed delayed release. But obviously, there is also the 4th option that the data must not be released for any public use the data can be used only within the project and any derivative derivates of that that would allow the reconstruction of the of the content that has to be deleted with the end of the PROJECT2 project. So, it. It is simply depends on the on the particle meeting,, what, what we can get. And then when we have the, actual recordings,, then we have to handle content properly. And here, the regulation on, on person data in the EU is quite clear and strict. So people would have to know of for what purpose are we, including could their personal data. In the meetings, and, what we are doing with that. And and again, for what purpose. So rather than asking for consent to publish personal data. We aim to delete them from the meeting. So we try. We will try to have the meeting recordings as anonymous as possible. And that way. No GDPR sensitive information will will appear in there. So the ideal deidentification pipeline would involve a voice, anonymization but obviously, because we are doing this for technical purpose. That would have to be done in way, that the ASR quality is not is not sacrificed. And also the the ASR research is not sacrificed so so the voice, should be distorted in some way in which humans cannot recognize the person, and maybe even like, techniques could not recognize the speaker. But still the ASR would work there. That would the ideal. And then the second stage, a would be to automatically replace all personal data. In our case this would mainly be just names and potentially email or other contact a contact coordinates of of people with placeholder. So that the there is not personal data. This is not possible in practice, so far, or maybe suggestions we will get to closer to this. Our current,, and more realistic plan is to well simply ignore the the problem of the voice and keep the voice recordings, as they are. So anybody who knows, the person would be probably able to identify who is the the the particle speaker in that meeting. And then will automatically search for all names and other potentionally sensitive named entities or references to, to individual persons. And will manually verify this automatic surge and we will replace it with placeholders. So here this work package is is mainly asking for feedback from you. Because we have the aim to standardize ethics procedures. We would like to, to standardize sensible things, and and good. A good ways the the the best possible handling of this. So if you have people in your teams who a deal with the same. Things. If you have a procedures a written down and forms of consent. That you give out to, to your subjects that provide you with with the data. Please get in touch. We would happily merge that in and then distribute it as a public like, deliverable,, some,, some manual hand book how to handle data collection. But for our practical purposes we would also be very grateful for any links to tools, for deidentification of both sound and text,, because we need to release the data set. And the better we do the deidentification the easier it was it would be to to publish it and and have the consent approved. Had the identification of the easier. And maybe you have other experience as well. So if you know of anything that we should do, or should not do in these matters. Please get in touch. And and let us know,. I have people for this colleagues in the team so I'll forward any of your comments to to them so just contact me. A SRL for art, any. Of, your a comments to have them. Or or anyone else in PROJECT2. So are there any questions to the presentations? So if there are none, then we will go to the high risk business of this of this session today. We are just on time, actually we are two minutes ahead of time. So that was the lack of questions on ethics. And this is we we are now give you a several demos of the whole system. So in the integration work package. PERSON3 was briefly presenting the ORGANIZATION9 platform. And that's the central part of the of the whole pipeline. The central element is called the Mediator. A that is a server. And to this server. All the different workers,, get connected. And these workers are like service providers developed at the different universities in the, in the consortium. And another type of, the client in this several client architecture also connects to the mediator and that's the client, which has the sound,, and would like the sound a stream of sound. Actually,, and live coming stream of sound to be either transcribed or translated directly or also presented to the web. So this the client specifies what should be done with this sound it is English sound and should be transcribed into English then segmented into sentences and then machine translated into Czech, and and and then present it on the web. So the specification of the client requests all these workers. And then when the actual sound starts coming in. This is, sent to the mediator. And then to all these components across Europe. And the client then receives a dummy output at the and and but, the the user is happy, because the subtitles or other type of information was presented on the web. So this set up is aimed for the live events that are happening like physically at a at a conference room, and we plug in to, to the sound acquisition, the the, devices there, and then ship it to the Internet. And then deliver it. But due to COVID. There were far fewer since March there were far fewer events than we planned to. And for the purpose of the demo. We actually had to develop a like a little hack. So that we ourselves are able to provide the a video of that event that we are going to subtitle. So. In the demo that you are going to see now. There will be one single machine running FFM pack video streaming, and that will be streaming the video for your web browser and independently. The machine will be sending the sound to the standard a pipeline that we have ready. And we are not a video streaming projects. So, there are a couple of things that we have done very suboptimal. So you will have to help us a little bit with some autoplay and other things. And also I would like to highlight that a, the delay or the the time mismatch between the delivery of the subtitles. And the video appearing on your screen is something which is totally beyond our control, like we will try. We'll do our best to have that in sync. But what happens in practice is that often the video streaming the delivery from our web server to your side. Is slower than the delivery of the subtitles. So if you see subtitles from the future, then don't be surprised. It is. The subtitles are being produced when that sound was available from the main streaming machine from the main source, but it took longer for the video to get to your browser, then this whole pipeline in in our system. So this is one setup that we will use, and another setup that we will use that will not involve any videos whatsoever. We will simply connect the subtitling to this call. So your questions spoken in English will also go through this, and they will appear on the web live transcribed and translated so that we can play with this. And and test how how hard the models are fighting with your accent, and, other things. So lets first demo the subtitled the the videos. For this I will need your help as said. So I would like you to open the the PROJECT2 presentation platform. Here is the URL PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION9.com. There is the username PROJECT2 @ PROJECT2.eu and the password PROJECT2. And the optimal screen size is this this one. So if that setup does not fit very well on your screen, then you may want to reduce your font size. So. If you see your subtitles wrapping into more than two lines. Then you need to reduce the the font size. And also,, you will need to allow auto play so that, the delivery of the video to your screen is delayed as little as possible. And as said we are not a sub not not a not a video broadcasting project. We don't know how to start the video for you when we want to present it. So you have to shift reload the page. When we tell you so. So, that will move, that will move us on to on to the next video. So there will be clear instructions when when to do this. So now for the auto play, if you are using Firefox. Then once you are on the PROJECT2.ORGANIZATION9.com then there is this settings icon or dropdown menu and among the permissions there should be autoplay, and you should allow audio and video autoplay. If you don't have the option to enable autoplay then you will have to play these videos automatically so after the shift reload you will have to click the play button manually. And then you will have to click towards the end of the current video as it's being streamed, so that your delay is is the smallest. And you will see as the video is being broadcasted that the ending time is is increasing and if your current time is lower than the ending time then this is the additional delay that you are having in your just video presentation. Otherwise like we we are subtitling it at the at the broadcasting time. So here is the summary, I'll do that myself now. So I'll so here is and I'll move onto the web browser, I'll type PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION9 com and I'm already logged in. So I couldnt tol couldnt show you the show you where to put the credentials but remember the credentials are PROJECT2 @ PROJECT2.eu and the password is PROJECT2, and later on I'll tell you to shift reload. So hopefully everybody is now not only watching my screen.",
            "Sorry there is a question in the chat about how to enable autoplay in Chrome.",
            "I don't think it's possible. So we we have tried to figure it out. We are afraid that in Chrome you have to do the, the manual clicking. So click on play click on the end, and then see that you are not too far behind the end. So there any other questions. I do not have screen big enough, so that I could see the chat so thanks PERSON10 for reading this loud. Yeah, so this is the this is the user interface. I'll make it full screen. And what you see here is a the video area. Here you will be clicking the play. And and it is,, then move towards the end of the video. This is the one of the subtitles boxes. And,, currently, we are demonstrating a the English Romania and a German and Czech subtitles. But we have many more in the project. And you can click these language a buttons. To enable or disable the languages. So obviously, this setting is forgotten after the shift reload. So do the shift reload. Then you will have some extra time to select the languages that you would like to watch,. And then the, the video will start. And, and, I wanted to say one more thing. It's usually goods to enable a the the language of the video so that you see the ASR output immediately, and also the languages that you can judge your for yourself. To see the translation delay. Okay, so in this user interface that you hopefully are setting up now. There will be three videos shown, the first one will be German short speech. All of them are like under three minutes. And this is a German short speech actually contain some bird in bird in the subtitles,, which are manually revised. And you can use them. To compare our outputs with with that setup. Then there will be a video of a three minutes of German lecture, a and then we will, be presenting some. Czech speech. And that will be in the domain of a ORGANIZATION8.s. So there you will see our a performance in the in the domain of, of interest and more videos would be coming. So I would like to now to ask if there if everybody is kind of ready for this. I would like to ask my colleague, PERSON13, and, on your screens in your web browsers, you should be watching this. And a PERSON13 has started now the the system. So in second, the system should tell us all to reload, and you now hit control shift reload. And when you do so. Then the video has started the video the the logo is moving. And that's a confirmation. And I'm two seconds after, the the real time. So I'll mute myself, and will keep watching and the video will start in a second. So the video has already ended. And you still see the subtitles in the target languages of translation running. So I'll leave it running for a while, the reason the reason will become more clear when you see the other user interfaces. But the reason is that for the better user experience we are actually delaying the output until the full sentences are stable. So that the machine translation is is producing a stable output, and then this stable output is is fed to the subtitle areas. So that that causes the the extra delay. Here we obviously had a the chance to manually transcribe this speech as well, so by the way the word error rate for this particular short speech was around 3 3 points, that's that's very low. So if you have any any questions to this video you can ask now, or we will go to other demos and maybe you'll have more questions when comparing the performances there. So the setup for the second video would be the same one. So again,, you should move to your web browser, stay on the same page, and, when the subtitles will say so, you will do the shift reload and we'll listen to a three minutes of the German lecture,. So,, would like now to ask my colleague PERSON13. Yes. So now shift reload. And if you see the video. The logo moving. Then you are all set a just figure out the languages that you would like to see. German lecture is going to be a presented. And I'll mute myself again. So that the sound is coming only from your video player in your web browser. Yeah. So here, the speech was obviously much faster, because it was spontaneously lecture. And also the content is accumulated in the other languages. So you see that the translations are still running in subtitles, and they will be running for a while. That simply because there is too much content being delivered by the, by the presenter, and we are not a shortening it as of yet. So you also see many translation errors, and most of them stem from the speech recognition errors. It's up to you to to to judge whether this is already practically usable or not,. And maybe that this impression would be also different. If you were not able to understand the source language. So here again, we know the word error rate for this lecture. It is fourteen points approximately. So if you have any questions. Please, please, ask, or we'll move to the third video. And that would be a Czech speech again in the domain of ORGANIZATION7. So if there are no questions. Then,, let's move onto the web browser again. And I would like to ask PERSON13, to, to start the system, which is just being done. And, yes, you should now shift reload, and I see the video, the logo moving. So I know that the subtitling will start soon. I'll follow Czech, which would be the source language and I'll follow English and German translations. And again, the sound will be coming only from your web browser. I'm four seconds a behind the, the real video. So I observed a little lag in the delivery of the video to my screen. Maybe that was only my issue. Otherwise, I see that, the subtitles in the other languages are still running. Again, lot of content was at the end,. And there is a kind of que, of that. So here,, the word error rate is about twelve points. And, I was kind of surprised by this number being so high, because when reading the Czech. I was happy about, the the quality in general. So when assessing the word error rate. I guess the same. A dependence on languages is appearing, because in Czech, many of the words were correct, lemmas correct base forms, but the endings were slightly different. And it didnt even change the meaning in some of the cases. But still it will it will hit the word error rate. I don't know, what your impression was from the translations. There were obviously some errors. But I think that some of the the the the the key messages of of that video were were preserved. So let now leave the area of subtitle presentation. And let's look at the live transcript of stream videos. And later on a live transcript of what we are going to say in in our call. So this will be the other user interface, so for this. You need to open another URL, and here the URL is well too ugly to to to read loud. So there is a tiny url that you can commit or if some colleague of mine can paste these URL links type them to the chat window that would be even more convenient. So, the paragraph view that we are going to to see will allow for looking at the same four languages that we had in the previous demo. Or eight languages and actually we could also do other languages. So you can go either for this 8 language presentation or 4 language presentation. And if you would like to see another language it's quite likely that we have it in our mix so you can manually modify this URL and try putting there another language code to see if if we also deliver something in in that language. So the tiny urls tiny url.com / PROJECT2-demo and then 4lang or 8lang. So I'll do that myself. So here. Tinyurl.com PROJECT2 demo and I'll go for the 8 lang 8 language setup. And again I'm sorry that I'm already logged in. So, I cannot show that you have to type the username which is now PROJECT2 only. And the password which is also PROJECT2, but you can do this easily for yourself. And, what is going to be presented. Will be this. These columns. And each of the columns will be for. One of the languages. The ther the individual sentences are not horizontally aligned, and that's because they differ in length. So it's meant not for head to head comparison between the, the different languages. But it is meant for a providing you full context within each of the languages of their own, but obviously they will appear in in Palo. On the right hand side, you will be able to select the languages,. And if you reload. Or if you add a language later, you will not get it's history. So it is better to start with large set of languages. And then disable those that you don't want to that you don't want to see. And, I need to explain the color coding a little. So the black sentences are those. Which are fully finalized, and the system will never get back to them. Then the the, the the darker gray sentences still can change. But it is only the segmentation a module that, that affects them. So it's changing the letter casing and a full stops in there. And the, the last of the sentences, which is still incoming where the words are still authored,, is in the light gray setup. And in the previous views. With the subtitles. We were showing the full level of of of this instant or simultaneity for the ASR language, so for the speech. There is no such, there are no no important edit's happening really. So we were. We were showing every update. But for the translations, we were only showing in the subtitle window. Everything that was black. And as these demos will run that you will see that the grey areas are often pretty long. They can spend multiple sentences, and these multiple sentences are partly usable,, but they can still change. So here, in this, the longer context view. It is not so disrupting to show you the PROJECT3. So you will see the PROJECT3 in the in the in the translation languages as well,, but in the subtitle view this PROJECT3 would be too too distracting so people could would not be able to, to, to follow. So that's why we, tend to prefer this type of view where the user has the ability to choose whether they want to read only the black text or focus only also on the very last words and their translations. So here again. The URLs. So please move onto your web browser and. And then, type in tinyurl.com / PROJECT2-demo or demo2 whichever you like. Enter the username PROJECT2 and password PROJECT2. There would be no need to reload this. So the reload would be useful only if you wanted to clear the history. The sound will be coming from the remote call. So I'll keep my sound coming in, and, it will not come from the presentation web page, because this presentation is actually meant for the live events, where the sound is coming from another stream. So videos will be only restreamed through the screen sharing, but the videos are not not so important. In in like the the information is not not necessarily so important for for your assessment. And we'll be showing three minutes of a same lecture, and we will start with a presenting the Czech constitutive interpretation of that lecture. So the speaker there in the image will be bored, because the speaker has already given a the the part of of that presentation, and now is the interpreter in Czech talking. And then we'll show you the original lecture, which was given in English. And in both cases will be translating it to all the target languages that we that we produced. So it will be the same three minutes,,, but for a, but first given by the interpreter. And second,, in the second video given by the original speaker. So here I would like PERSON13 again to start that video, and the video is starting. So you will see the instructions to reload. Please do not. I'll reload only here myself so that I can stream you the the video for you. And now this is going to be given in czech. So you should be watching your web browser with the paragraph you and my screen share to get the video if you wish. Yes, so that was the Czech interpreter, and the main speaker was just listening to that we now still see the the of the translation a a translations appearing. And again we have a number for you. Here the word error rate of the Czech ASR was about 18 points. And you could judge the, the quality of the translations yourself. You also had the chance to see how the translations PROJECT3 a in the grey part. So it happens, especially for the common expression, such as in total, or in some overall all these beginning of the sentences have changed a few times as the segmentation of the sentences was getting stable. At at one point, I saw that in the, in the paragraph view. And if we were presenting, these outputs of the translation into English,, to the, to the user. Then a lot of words would be jumping. And if if we are doing this jumping within the greyish part, it's not so distracting. But if we had only the two lines of the subtitles for this jumping, then we would have to show it. And then reshow. In the new very end and that would be very very like very hard to follow. So now I would like to move to the last video demo. So PERSON13 again, if you can start it. You should keep watching the paragraph view, and I'll do the shift reload myself. So that again, you have the original English sound coming through my, screen sharing. So now, the speech will be delivered in English. And, it will be again, translated to all these languages. So if you have the a chance to, watch. The German, and watch and understand the German translation. This will be the most interesting output actually. Yeah so that was it. So PERSON13 can now switch on the subtitling of the of the call it'self, and I'll comment on what you have seen in the meantime. So this was the the last the broadcasted lecture. It was the original English lecture. The word error rate here was a 32 points. And the reason is that it's highly accented. It's Austrian English. So we also have the translation of this, because it's part of our PROJECT2 test set. And, the when translating into German for the whole lecture. Is about fifteen fifteen by points, and you should so just small snippet of this. But by comparing these these word error rates,, I wanted to highlight the fact that, sometimes. The, English of the. The the the speech of the origin speaker is not the best source for your output, and, because we have these three minutes, on these three minutes. We we did a very small head to head comparison. It's actually just 23 sentences. So it's not stable, obviously, not very reliable score. A but the score into German was about thirteen points. When the source was the Czech interpreter. And it was about ten points when the source was the original English speech. And I should also highlight that the reference, was created from,, the original English speech, so that was manually segmented for the purposes of creation of, the reference and then manually translated. So, the English. So the German reference is technically more closer towards what was said in the in the English talk, but still because of the ASR errors and also. Translation divergences, the final quality of translation into German seems better from the interpreter. So this is this was the last demo, of video lectures. And we still have one more demo but that will go on through during our discussion. Keep looking at the same webpage. The paragraph view. So you don't reload anything. And in your web browser. You should suddenly see all my speech,, being a translated into all the languages. So if my accent is better is is not too strong then it will recognize me, and if I'm lucky and if I'm wording my sentences clearly enough so that the language model would be able to insert full stops where they belong. Then also the translation into all the languages have a chance of of being good. So I now really open the discussion sorry for cutting it short with the demos, a and a please ask anything, whatever you say in English will immediately be transcribed. Well.",
            "Let me start by saying that the demos were quite nice, quite impressive, especially given that you are doing it. Over the network, and so on. So I will say this was a nice piece of work. I was not able to follow lot of the translation because other than English I don't speak or understand any other languages. But I'm sure some of the other who speak two of them will be able to verify what you are saying. And that's my first comment. At some point known about how humans restart the changing text and so on. But let me first hold that back and let others say other things that they want.",
            "Yeah, thank you, thank you PERSON13.",
            "Can I ask a few questions?",
            "Yes please do.",
            "So first question is how PROJECT2 does the available on GitHub how PROJECT2 test sets were collected, cause right before that it was was mentioned the modification of that pipeline.",
            "No, yeah. So let me answer immediately so the PROJECT2 test set if you are asking about the test set, that is being collected mainly manually. And it's it's now targeted towards the domain that we have at the moment which is auditing. So some of the for example this video that we have shown that was, that was my, that was a video delivered to YouTube or saved to YouTube by the ORGANIZATION8. of the Czech republic, because they ran some years ago some workshop. And we have taken that and we have manually transcribed that and we have provided translation for that. Then other parts of the PROJECT2 test set come from the Antrecorp which was mentioned, that was the student firmfare and this student firmfar firfair that was high school students presenting mock companies and we recorded their 90 second speeches. That highlight what their company is is doing. And their s again we provided translations of this very much non native English into German and Czech so that is other part of that. And for the all diversity of languages we are we are working on something which we called exotic languages. So we have many annotators curating parallel data. And there also it's not for not from Paracrawl but it is from our targeted search for like in domain websites. Which are sometimes had they have parallel text and we just manually refine the sentence alignment but in in a few cases we probably will have to also provide our manual translations because the language would be so under resourced in the domain that we won't have anything. We are trying to avoid this we are trying to find parallel data but we are not searching for it in Paracrawl because it is by far incomplete. So it's better to targeted search.",
            "Thank you very much. Can I ask two more question an the rest. So for ethics so you you only covered the data protection, have you also considered that adressing to gender and accent for maybe adressing.",
            "So well, I don't consider this a ethical question as an ethical question. I consider it a technical question like a for example, in the in the test set if it's too biased. In some way, then we are not accessing the preservation of of the aspects. I think that a translation systems and speech recognition systems. Should preserve the biases of the source. So, they they should not artificially distort the biases that are in the source. And for that. The test set should be. Should be balanced. But that's not an ethical issue is just like how to over sample the underrepresented classes. How to figure out what is an underrepresented class and how to oversample it. So that is that that is the the comment that I have to that. In short we are gathering all we have. And all this rebalancing,, will be only up to the,, the whatever authors of these systems or up there further users of of our data sets. If we are able to gather, any metadata, such as like, who is the speaker and well not not in person, but, not not. The personality not the person himself, but but the the gender and the nationality. Then this metadata would be there. We will try to preserve but if we don't have this information there is no way to to recover it, we may try to recover it like automatically but someone can do it later on af and better if with with the target focus. So I'll find it a technical problem how to preserve the biases that are in the source given the fact that the training data are not in good balance I do not find it an ethical issue. I hope.",
            "Yeah thanks. Yeah yeah thanks. Just to clarify my question, I was wondering whether you your interested in knowing whether your system is doing particularly well on or particularly poorly on some kind of input.",
            "Yeah yeah so.",
            "Preserving.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah, so that's we observe this and we want this but still we are at a far simpler phenomena such as question, so essentially questions are underrepresented in the training data sets and we tend to translate or or recognize questions as as statements. And and translate them aside so. Yes the the the gender disbalance or gender distortion an sentiment distortion and and whatever this will come later. And yes we are aware of those problems, and we would like to test them equally across the board but at this point we are gathering all the data that we can and that's that's it.",
            "Okay great thank you. A last quick question was about, speech output so I think thanks for the demos they were very nice and and looking through the demo wondering from a user perspective what what makes more sense. And depending speech output. And whether you have like faults on this and and.",
            "Yeah so in the project proposal. We explicitly excluded speech output. And I'm happy for that, because it turned out to be difficult enough to fit. The, the stable output in the two lines of the subtitles. So my preference, my personal preference is more towards this paragraph view, which you are now of looking at,, because I'm happy to read more and recover from the errors. If you have the small window or speech, which is essentially just cursor moving through that. And you cannot really go back in a sensible way, then you really have to have stable a output. And, that you can achieve either with the big delay, and there you. You can run any speech synthesis that you wish. And it will have plenty of time to to do whatever is is needed there. But it is it is not a simultaneous anymore. So I do not think that, speech output will be a relevant until we are able to stabilize the text output. So a question, because the interpreters human interpreters often make various assumptions or anticipations, about the the context, and by that,, they can produce translations of words. Of all, for example, German words, which have not been uttered yet, because these end of the sentence didnt still come. So, attaching, speech output. To me is like a simple end, like last bit of a pipeline. Once the output is stable. At the same time. There is very interesting research question, if we can go directly speech to speech. So if we can create transformers. That will digest the the sound and directly produce the sound and there the alignment problem. Becomes very very critical. And,, I think. If we do the, stabilization of empty output correct. A then have on this synthetic data for example. It would make sense to train speech to speech systems, but, we are not there yet, and it also depends on the type of content that you are translating a or interpreting,? I can imagine that a regular. It is like, of fellow, the follow like person on the street to person, person on the street, a communication. This will contain much shorter of sentences,, or rather short phrases, and they are. You essentially have enough information after a very short period of time,, to, to decide on the translation. So there, the immediate speech to speech translation makes sense. If we are aiming at what the PROJECT2. And that's a translation of a conference presentations. These sentences are much more complex, and you have to wait until the, the sentences has finished, until you know, what is what is the message of, of the sentence,, and only then you can properly articulate the information structure of of that sentence and target language. So, I don't think that for our,, use case, a speech to speech. An instant speech to speech is a is a good. Is a good goal.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So we have just run out of time. And I'm still very much looking forward to any comments that you may have. So even now, if you still have the time, please keep chatting.",
            "So let me make a few comments before of course those who need to leave at 11 can leave and if you need to some closing remarks.",
            "Yeah yeah, so I'll I'll I would like just the closing reminder that I would like to thank everybody for their attention we are here for one more year and and few months or maybe one and half years because we may want to get some no cost extension of the project a little one. So and the web page will will remain further on and also the the research team obviously will not disappear and many of the challenges that we set forth in in our project will remain relevant for another decade. I'm quite sure, especially the automatic summarization of meetings. So I would like to remind you of the few calls for ideas and calls for data that we had throughout this. Presentation, the slides are now in the ORGANIZATION4 document, we are partically interested in your experience in the deidentification in your t data for minuting. So whatever meetings, project meetings you have we are also happy to actually create the minutes for these meetings afterwards. We cannot offer it as a service but we are happy to use just the recordings of the meetings and we will provide the the summarization ourselves with our with our people. Because the the project meeting data is so so so hard to get that we are happy with for anything. So these are the two main two main calls that we had. And there are other ones and we would like any comments on on any other aspect. So thank you very much for your participation, thank you for the comments that you have had had so far. And looking forward to another opportunity to to like meet again remotely or at some of the conferences. So those of you who have to leave, thank you for attention and enjoy the rest of the day and those of you who can stay please stay. Thank you. Yeah, thank you.",
            "One is where it comes to or forms or getting doing the current handling of the data meetings. I don't know if the ORGANIZATION8 guys are still involved in. Because the similar data set that recorded. And that data is being shared with people and so on so you could find out what. Because I'm thinking it was GDPR. And I don't know whether PERSON7 or who is from ORGANIZATION8.",
            "Sorry sorry, I didnt catch the name of that, there wasn't.",
            "Oh that was a. Actually the people involved may have been from ORGANIZATION13 not ORGANIZATION8.",
            "I'm not this. The speech crew is separate to us, but I don't I havent heard of it.",
            "Yeah so ask them because the collection is called something in home. Basically speech recognition task where the setup connect microphone in the house. And they had four people getting together talking spontaneously. And so they must have gathered some forms and add some protocol. Now in their case they must have got full permission because they havent. We don't know the names of the people. But identified. Most of the time. Other people let LDC and nest to collect these things regularly they might have formed you might have known some of these people. Like or, so you could just ask them if they have forms, that might help with that.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "As far as deidentification tools I know that example the IRB at PERSON4. Has pretty much started as if you have from speech from person. There it's pretty much identifiable. In the sense that you can use automatic techniques and two minutes of speech, the error rate of most is like you know, whatever. Less than 2 minus 4 at some. So basically they say look they have to give consents and the voice will be in there, That's a different story. So I don't if there are two. One possibility is that people who have been working on adversary trying to distort the signal a little bit so that the speaker ID system fails. But human can still understand the speech. And if some of those people are have something that we can use, that will be useful. The issue might be that these techniques are new enough that no proving will accept them as protecting. So that might be the issue but I think it always come. Can establish that this person cannot be identified from their voice and proving the negative. To show that they can be identified as easy to show that they cannot be identified as hard. So who knows what techniques in the future right. So that might be the issue people agree. Or like PERSON6 you said remove the audio just keep the transcript and that might be. Yeah so that is, and also the second I took on this particular point as an from myself. But there were few others like you said. So if you could just summarize as participants in the follow, that would be helpful.",
            "Okay, we'll do that, thank you.",
            "Okay thank you. So otherwise this was very informative, very useful, thank you very much, it is a nice project, and we'll be in touch.",
            "Yeah thank you.",
            "And as you know people here you know are very interested speech translation past. So. So that will be a lot of opportunities to what together on this.",
            "Yeah yeah. Yeah. So if there are no further questions we can also close this I'll stop the screen sharing now. You can still keep watching the the paragraph view of of the subtitles, so that's something that will run as long as as we talk. And we can play around with this, so that we can see how the sentence segmentation is under performing and how it affects the the translation then. Maybe yeah, I think that hindi is also if you speak hindi. Hindi is also among our languages so. Is possibly hindi output there. But you don't have it in the in the list at the moment. So so maybe PERSON13 can provide the link so that we could see the translation into Hindi. We don't have at the moment, yeah so okay so so we have an Hindi system but it's not not in the pipeline today. Yeah yeah, so who else is on the on the call if yeah, so many we have PERSON12 from and then we have also our colleague from ORGANIZATION8. who was also watching it. And I dunno if if he would have any comment or question from the user perspective but he is probably only recording in for his colleagues because some of them are on vacation. So he may not have the capacity the experience of the of the person from the field. Of auditing, he is a technical person and not not and auditor. So if there are no further questions. Then I'll just thank you again very much, I'll I'll thank to all my team for the hard work and this was again the dry run obviously for our review so remember that in about two weeks from now. We have the official project review and there will have to provide much more details about the research content, but it's the slides are halfway ready. Thanks to the already. Okay, so thanks very much and I'll just quickly check the chat, yes people were people were commenting on that. There were some problems, yup yup. So hopefully nothing is left unanswered. Okay, so thanks very much and yeah, looking forward to another opportunity to talking to you.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thanks PERSON6. Bye bye.",
            "Yeah yeah I will do, PERSON13 yeah bye bye. Goodbye."

            "Hi PERSON11.",
            "Hi yeah, I'm happy to see that you notice a new link.",
            "Yes.",
            "So lets others, and. The question is how would you like to present the. So we saw that the the video didn't quite work for PERSON10, but it could have been just an issue with the video from the slides.",
            "Mm-hm.",
            "And I see that PERSON12 is here in in my room like, but don't probably not in the right call, are you in the you are connecting? Yeah, he is he is connecting to the correct Zoom call. So, would you prefer the live demo, or the the video.",
            "If you a, if we are sufficiently confident to run the live one.",
            "It succeeded few times already.",
            "We can keep test it also in the afternoon work.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Don't worry because I know that PERSON12 moved to the new ASR. And he is working together with PERSON6.",
            "Um-hum, so like you decide you will be in full control of the presentation, you will you will have your or screen and you will ask PERSON12 to start it or or whatever.",
            "Yes, and and please thank San PERSON12 for us. He's really really precious.",
            "Yeah. Unfortunately as you may know.",
            "Yes yes, I know, I know. I know.",
            "We'll see how that will go with the new people the the is this is the person who should take the position of like running the experiments and so on. Running these the system. But he is so far not able to come to the Czech republic. So it's more complicated.",
            "Yes.",
            "If PERSON2, great so people are connecting to the new link. So I decided to start a new session rather a than to keep the old one, because it was not clear. If it would override the recording and I want to give PERSON2's presentation to a student of mine. So that's why I'm.",
            "Hum. And do you like to run the demo inside the presentation at the beginning at the end.",
            "Its after you. Where, it's totally up to you just decide and.",
            "Okay okay then I we will put it where we talk about links of the demos and we can.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "And if it fails then you can always say oh okay so there is technical issues within the web.",
            "Yes. PERSON12 do you hear me?",
            "Yes I see that PERSON12 has already launched the the the subtitling of into the paragraph view. Into the main languages, and I think that a it worked during the morning so I what I was kind of missing but we don't have PERSON10 yet. Would be a link from PERSON10 presentation to the to that paragraph view demo. And then I think that the lunch break makes it convenient so that then we don't have to like start one system and switch to another one right away, so after the lunch. I don't think that the subtitling should be or the paragraph view should be running, but instead we should be getting for the, video subtitling demonstration by you. So that's that makes it nice nice and natural division. So before lunch paragraph view without any explanation just as a link for fun.",
            "Oh okay use PERSON5 sharing the slides okay.",
            "Yes it is me.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Because I was saying oh wait a moment. Okay so PERSON12 do you hear me?",
            "Yes PERSON12 is here but cannot speak.",
            "Okay okay. Please PERSON12 as presentation platform demo you know which one is my favorite video. And prepare it please.",
            "Yeah okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So PERSON11 just a I will present the first path of WP6 and then leftover to PERSON9 for the.",
            "Okay yeah.",
            "So we can also make some more let me see let me say shed presentation of the.",
            "Yes yes that's definitely okay. So do whatever you like, I I will check now but its important also that ORGANIZATION6 is well represented in the integration and I know that the ORGANIZATION6 I I'm happy to see PERSON1 here. But I know that they have been quite quiet especially during the extra load they got on covid, so. PERSON1 please make sure that you are well represented this this is very important. And it would be also more important in the second half of the project so that like you fell confident and the we are yeah this is this is good. So there is the the demo was already shown and so lot of work has been done but the viewers can ask for more. So just make sure we we report everything that we did and that we do enough in the in the next half of the project.",
            "Hum okay.",
            "So that's that's I think that PERSON5 can start right?",
            "Yeah I was just wondering PERSON1, do you think presenting this final.",
            "Yeah sorry, PERSON12 is saying some, so please talk to PERSON9 or. Oh, so there. Yeah yeah, will the the demo today will be little risky starting on PERSON12's machine instead of the cluster, because the cluster seems busy at the moment. But let's give it a try and then in for in the rest of the afternoon I think that PERSON12 and PERSON6 can can try it again to be sure that it will run better if it runs badly. But maybe.",
            "Okay okay in any case don't worry I the video of the.",
            "So in that case lets also try the video during this call, so today let's try both.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "It its it will be again different platform webex instead of zoom but we need to test so that there there is a bigger chance that it works. Okay so that's enough from me, and I think that PERSON5 can start.",
            "Just a second. PERSON1 do you feel confident in presenting this slide the slide I'm sharing.",
            "Yes as long as it doesn't go into more technical detail, this seems to be very yeah this seems to be how can I say that, a kind of description of what happens inside the of ORGANIZATION6 right?",
            "No no, don't worry, its just related to the presentation layer, so you can just mention for, of course if you prefer we can present it we we can present it. But if you like to make your in your presentation of the slide you can just go through the, presentation aspects of the ORGANIZATION6 clients, so talk about the fact that the reason the chat. People see their faces, audio stream is passed to this this architecture and retrieves transcriptions translations and chat view. And so on.",
            "I I can do that that's that shouldn't be a problem as long as there are no technical questions I feel confident that I can present the slide which I see now with this T6.1 platform updates right?",
            "Yes exactly.",
            "Okay, yeah, sure I can do this. Sure.",
            "Okay nice.",
            "Okay, perfect. So thank you everybody, can I start?",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm PERSON5 from ORGANIZATION3 we as ORGANIZATION3 had bulk packages leader of WP6 which is the work package that you get it to the integration and the of services. Integration and of services and also running of events. So the main goals of this work package are to provide and then hands the integration platform in order to make this platform usable by all of the usecases that are part of the PROJECT3 project. Integrate the NLP engines so ASR SMT and machine translation engines from all of the with the platform to develop the presentation platform for the because it is a. Important and it is also part of the project to provide the subtitles in all of the forecasted in all of the languages to the end users. To integrate the spoken language translation into the ORGANIZATION6 platform, to integrate the automatic minuting we have seen in the WP5. Into the ORGANIZATION6 platform, and as I already mentioned to run the events. Running the events means taking care of a all of the end use the services and the presentation platform to provide transcription and translation of the spoken events. Sorry. As you can see here in the just a second. Because I have to move the bar with the with the speakers.",
            "You can make it smaller so there is this one.",
            "Yeah but it it was covering part of the presentation.",
            "Not not for us not for us though, but its only for you.",
            "But for me, yeah for me. So as you can see in the diagram on the left on the right side of the slide, this is the overall structure of the project as you can see the WP WP6. Is the container let me say the final result of the integration of all of the components developed th in the previews workpackages. Work package, the work package is organized in four into four tasks. The first one is the platform dates meaning the evolution of ORGANIZATION3 and the ORGANIZATION6 platform to handle all of the use cases and. Primarily the multi target translation and the presentation of the subtitles both in original language. The second task is the integration of the engines that are provided by the all of the pans into the platform to run the events to run the by the use case. The third task is the minuting demonstrator. So the development of the, the demonstration platform to provide minutes of conferencing. The fourth task is the running of let me say events not only ORGANIZATION5 events the main one is the ORGANIZATION2 2020 that has been moved 2021. But this is the main one, where will be where has been and there would be many other preparatory events rather as relevant as the ORGANIZATION2 for us. All other plans are participated into the in the work package 6 because it is everybody integrates its on system with the platform. Just to give you a brief idea of the milestone that have been, that are part of the WP6 EUC that have been many milestones till now, so majority of the milestones have b have already to place in the past 18 month. We have now next year the ORGANIZATION2 where have been moved, next year due to the COVID breakout. So apart from the ORGANIZATION2 congress we are on schedule on the for the, milestones and, as you can see we also added the new events we have run even more events than planned. So we had no delay due to the COVID crisis till now. Regarding the platform, the platform that we made available to the consortium is architector which is the call. Component that handles the integration of all of the NLP engines and. The important features where I like to stress here is that one with one single per service architector we are able to run a both face to face conferences by integrating ASR and SLT engines to provide the text to the presentation platform to be delivered to the participants. And also conferencing getting all the from the ORGANIZATION6 platform providing all of the necessary ch services to provide the output to the ORGANIZATION6 platform in order to to. To show subtitles and minutes inside the application. The dark grey components are the new components that have been developed as part of the developed as part of the WP6. The light grey one are the components that have been updated upgraded in order to support the use cases. So just a brief description of the platform, the bl the platform is composed by the mediator as a central component which connects clients and workers and handles the distribution and the combination of the results in order to provide the final result of the natural language processing. So its in the pan and relies on a a library and SDK we should converts requests into XML based messages and sends with cross denied worker from clients to worker and then recombines the output. So I hand over the to PERSON9 that will go in the details of the task update as of month 18 of the project. Please PERSON9.",
            "Okay thank you PERSON5. Would you like I share my screen or you prefer to move you the slides.",
            "I will go and move the slides just tell when to switch, okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Just tell me next.",
            "Okay okay. Okay, then as PERSON5 told you task 6.1, the extension of the ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION6 platforms to handle the new use cases. In the first half of the project, we focused on the use case requirements identification and collection of user feedbacks. And of course on partner support during integration. We'll together achieved some remarkable results. Being able to coordinate workflows among over 90 different services. In the next part of the project we will work on some communication protocol extension. In particular we are working on some optimization during services selection. And of course the native support of the multitarget translation services. Next please. Okay. Okay. Upon the ORGANIZATION3 service architecture infrastructure we developed and integrated a presentation to the transcription and translations to the end users. ORGANIZATION3 developed the presentation platform web application which provides multiple simultaneous transcription and translation in subtitle view. Together with, slides screen. And this application has been used during the annual meeting of the core group 2 of ORGANIZATION2 in June 2019 in LOCATION1. During this event we delivered live and automatic subtitles to roughly 30 participants in 10 different languages. Next. ORGANIZATION7, propose are different approach to present the live transcription and translation in their online text flow web application. Online text flow focuses on providing multiple simultaneous transcription and translation in paragraph view. And these has been tested during the during several linguistic monday say minaries F ORGANIZATION7. As well as during the workshop on using language IT technologies. Held in February 2020. Okay next. Is the ORGANIZATION6 slide. PERSON1?",
            "Yes, I I tried. So what you can see on the right side is the implementation of the transcription and translation function in ORGANIZATION6. We put it in the side bar and what happens are 3 steps, at first we transmit each participants audio stream and second we caught it and save it for later reference. And third we display the transcript and translation in windows which yeah seems to be like our chat window. While every person can choose the language we we did setup the room for at beginning, we also can configure the whole room so that we for example can offer two three or five or more languages. Where every user can choose from. And the end its possible to transcript sorry to export the transcription for later usage like. Email notes or whatever.",
            "Okay. And this application of course has being test by ORGANIZATION6 training but its also nice to know that we tested also altogether during the PROJECT3 periodic meetings. Next. Kay. Okay it's the new task. This one yes. Task 6.2 concerns the integration of the components developed by the research partners with the ORGANIZATION3 service architecture. ORGANIZATION7 ORGANIZATION4 and successfully integrated their components in the ORGANIZATION3 service architecture pretty soon in 2019. And we successfully tested in 2019 and 2000 2020 during several events and demos. This was made possible by the great commitment of the partners and by the continuous sharing of experiences tests and results. Regarding the native support of the multi target, translation services. ORGANIZATION3 is working on the integration design and it will be completed during the second half of the project. Next. Okay this is,, please there is, please who who is working on 5 please. Listen to this part of the presentation. Okay,. Task 6.3 concerns the implementation of the minuting demonstrator, a platform that will provide minuting to participants of online meetings. During 2019, we went through the technical aspects related to, the minuting pipeline integration. And we worked on it we will work on it during the second half of the project. Our first valuable goal is to develop a nice and usable interface as much flexible as possible. At the first stage, a human user will take automatic transcription, take the complete sentences of the automatic transcription, copy and paste them into infrastructure and then he will summarize them. After having a stable manual workflow we will start introducing the automations well described by our colleagues in 5. We will agree to focus on the batch processing so the workflow is to wait until the meeting ends. And then export the full English transcription and use it for minuting process. This will give us the chance to fix possible errors and remove out of topic this. Okay and automatic minuting is an open field research topic, but we agreed that everything we will be able to provide, will be an advantage both for us of course for the project. And for the next researchers working on this topic. Next. Okay, regarding task 6.4, I've to say they that we are pretty much successful during the first I will not laugh I promise. Regarding task 6.4, during the first half of the project we run several events and in particular last year we managed two ORGANIZATION5 events, one in LOCATION1 and one in LOCATION2. Next. Thank you. During the, PROJECT1 workshop in LOCATION1 we delivered live transcribed and translated subtitles in 10 different languages to 30 participants. And during the LOCATION2 ORGANIZATION2 workshop we tested our improved ASR and SLT configuration. Okay, next. Here if you are interested you can find a couple of recording of past events. But now maybe we can have our short demo of the presentation platform workflow. If PERSON12 is ready. Okay.",
            "Yeah I'm not sure PERSON12 PERSON12, are you ready?",
            "Meanwhile we can test.",
            "So the Czech A the Czech ASR doesn't work at the moment that's that.",
            "Okay this is the perfect moment to test the video.",
            "The video okay.",
            "Sorry PERSON5 I will.",
            "Yes please.",
            "To stop the share screen, and I will share mine. Okay close it.",
            "No stop share.",
            "Okay and I will share my VLC okay sure. You should see the VLC application.",
            "Yes we do.",
            "Okay and is there anything I have to make to share also audio.",
            "That was I think when you were starting your sharing.",
            "Hum, okay.",
            "Yeah in Zoom it's an option I don't.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Where backs.",
            "Okay okay I found it okay, sure. And.",
            "I like it so much.",
            "Yeah and the music helps.",
            "Its also the topic its so touching.",
            "Yeah, s I dunno if PERSON5 also in the Zoom.",
            "Yes.",
            "Do you think that the delay caused by Zoom is okay, do we live with this or do we.",
            "I I think but, its okay for the.",
            "For the review.",
            "Meeting. And the I would say would be great to publish it to provide the l the li.",
            "The link. Yes.",
            "To vimeo or whatever it is in order to. Yeah exactly.",
            "Yeah. I suggest that you upload it to YouTube because the the video the original video well, heh. They can ban us, I dunno how that works. Because the sound is the same you know. And the its like frame video and they have this anti like, to to prevent people from reusing others content.",
            "I I dunno, we will reason about it later.",
            "Yeah. Okay PERSON5 would you like to reshare the slides or you prefer I share them.",
            "I I think its better you you share because.",
            "Yes yes I agree. U u. Let see. Sure.",
            "So so maybe PERSON9 when if we go for the video shown, then you can also mention this that we cannot simply reupload this video to Youtube because the source already comes from Youtube and then. Youtube would see it as copyright or or whatever autorship in and.",
            "Yes actually actually on is the the demo we played for PERSON3 in June. Its not new.",
            "So the yes, but its the reviewers are new I think I don't think that the reviewers were any at any of the session.",
            "Oh okay, okay okay. Sorry. This. You should see the full slides view, okay. Okay we saw the the demo we talked about here you can find next. Okay. Thanks to events experienced we collected a lot of lessons learned and user feedbacks. For example we understood how important is to have more control on audio quality and volume and the importance of a distributed approach in order to share workload and provide more reliable service. User feedback on presentation platform usability has also being really precious and starting from them we are planning presentation platform restyle and next. For example to take into account user needs to, maximize video player with slide content and possibly achieve a mobile friendly design. We are working on a kind of overlay view of the subtitle and we are also reasoning on how to gain ORGANIZATION7 experience and provide a kind of history view of the discussion. Okay. Well the COVID situation impact our plan a lot of planned events have been canceled. We prepared some extra tool in order to be able to not only cast local slides but also on demand remote videos. But of course this is not enough to replan the events. We would l we would like also to plan event, but in particular the next year we will have the project main event which is the ORGANIZATION2 congress. And as usual we are pleased to receive your suggest on possible new events. In any case we look confident and hopeful to 2021 and accept of what has been postponed of one year. We are in line in line with the with the plan, and that's all for me.",
            "Okay thank you.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I dunno if anybody has further suggests or.",
            "We were on the schedule roughly.",
            "Yeah. Think so.",
            "Okay okay nice.",
            "Okay, so I think we are all good, so PERSON12 will let us know I'm afraid that its EAC deadline which is coming shortly and our colleagues have the flooded the the cluster.",
            "Yes I am also especially interested if regarding the minuting part if any of you has some some suggestion for us or if you think that we can explain better something, please let us know.",
            "Yeah I think, I think that this was good, and I I like the idea that the way you put it so that the minuting demonstrator can run in full with humans under the hood. And if the demo get better then we can replace the various manually manual steps in with or automatic models. So thats I think this way we can easily have results at the end of the project regardless whether the the technology of minuting is sufficiently good or not. So.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "And I think you say this plan loud then it would be also good for the reviewers, so here that like we have no blocking conditions in in the plan.",
            "Okay.",
            "Otherwise I think it was all clear and and good.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So thanks and lets move to the dissemination work package, right? And then. So our.",
            "Yes maybe you can tell me how I can share my screen here.",
            "Its at the bottom in the middle of the.",
            "Share screens okay.",
            "And you have to click share the whole screen probably.",
            "Okay let me see.",
            "Because if you share only windows then it fullscreen presentation does not really work well.",
            "Do you see the presentation now?",
            "Yes yes perfect.",
            "Okay great. That's normal that I can't see it I just can't see on my screen right? I cant I can't see it in the Zoom.",
            "Yes, you don't see.",
            "Okay okay okay. Okay, pl one thing I want to to say before I start please let me know if you can optimize some thing, I have time window of 2 hours today after this call, where where don't have anything to do for ORGANIZATION6 so please let me know if there are some. There are something open or if you want to have more details for tomorrow. So I can implement it today.",
            "Yeah also, it would be good to use this window to discuss further plans so that will be for for ORGANIZATION3 to to link with you so that the the minuting demonstrator just to check the status like what where we are what are the expected problems. How much time you will have for that and yeah. So so like a checkup of the because we did have any any call recently so it will be good to make use of this opportunity. Even if its not for the review immediately, the reviewers can also ask about our future plans and its its good it would be good to like have them secured.",
            "Okay, this information was for ORGANIZATION3 right?",
            "Yeah for and you, was so that.",
            "I I have a few, I have on the last slide have I have kind of conclusions what we do with the work package 7 what's the future for package 7 but yeah. Maybe will see if if if it works if you say it's okay if not just let me know, okay?",
            "Yeah thank you.",
            "So okay. At first I want to start with short agenda what I want to talk about in the next minutes. At first I want to talk about the different activities and the work packages. What happened until now until month 18, and then will talk about the impact of COVID 19. Which changed a bit of lets say of the work instruction and the structure of the dissemination activities and I will talk more about the changes especially, within future outlook what we will how we will adapt to this new situation. At first, you can see the different activities, T7.1 project website, I show here the the work from from ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION6. ORGANIZATION7 managed just mainly the website and what happened until now its the status is the website is running and its in use I will show examples of later on. When we talk about updates and PR we have ongoing online repods for example an our own website on ORGANIZATION6training.te and with a few live and live trainings I will show you pictures of this later on. Still like its in the call the post project five years after the project. When we come to social media and media coverage there that's one change we will talk about later that will put more effort into social media in the upcoming month. Because as we found out that the to COVID 19 everything switches more in especially all the marketing and, information processes how for example or how newspaper informs themselves. So what we have at the moment we have Twitter and Instagram account we are thinking about adding link in the because seems to be more on the professional level then for example Instagram which is more on the private level. When we talk about dissemination activities in concerns of trade until now we attended 24 until today. The most happened in 2019 because of COVID19 the end of the trade first was like I would say February March 2020 but later on. We have also dissemination I will show you the numbers later. So, the workshop on NLP technologies for uses is postponed to May 2021 so it will couldn't have this year because of COVID19. But still even if its postponed we don't have any deviation from plan because covid 19 will help us with within the project it doesn't stop us.",
            "Sorry if I may quickly interrupt. The the. The the the the workshop that was planned as the part of the ORGANIZATION2 congress actually is also without any deviation there is but the, the workshop was run in dry run mode so its fully prepared.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that's why that's why I claimed that there is no deviation from plan because we have the people, well one of them will be los leaving for Germany for the semester but the he is actually ready to come over. To run his part of the workshop, the the workshop is is fully ready and that's why I say there is not deviation from the plan. Because, yeah.",
            "Okay, may I say live live workshop will happen in May 2021.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah yeah.",
            "I I. Okay. Okay sorry I guess that's way better than writing postponed right? Okay. As I said.",
            "One more one more type will happened.",
            "Oh sorry. Okay, thanks PERSON11. Okay so,, at the small deviation from plan when we look more into details like the website, what what we can see here that the website lives. ORGANIZATION7 does, at for example short articles about the scientific papers summary on the block for example. And here's also an example of social media and media coverage. This is from PERSON11 which was posted in Twitter this year. When we look into trade fairs as I said before, we had 2019 because of COVID 20. COVID19 trade nearly stopped but we will see what happens now, because what really was successful we with ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION6training we had a lot of live talks in 2020. At the moment we had more than 100 presentation with interested potential customers with etc etc. And what we showed there all the time is the live transcription feature and what I can tell and what I see from all of my colleagues who do this presentation as well as that its one of the most requested features from the market. Because everyone in his or their company they have this language barrier where they need solution to get rid of this. When we talk about scientific dissemination until now there are 29 papers that caught acknowledge. Yeah, so far for scientific dissemination. What changed due COVID19 as I said trade fairs and talk shifted from offline to online space, and I said this will help us. What we think and what we expect is to create in the upcoming months because of the shift to online space. What we can what we see we have more online presentations all the trade for companies are desperately in search for online solutions and what we think is when we present online we can show the potential we can better show the potential than we can do it with with offline presentation. What we also will do is we will produce more video content and at the moment we are filling our own Youtube channel with the examples and there is also video which I will record in I guess in 2 weeks. Where we show the live transcription translation and transcription function within ORGANIZATION6. What is the conclusion what we what we what did we learn in the last 18 month at first. Don't show sorry don't tell show which means we got the most responses with live presentations, when people realized what is the true ex potential from when they really see okay, when I speak something happens I see a text and the text is another language or I can switch my own language to English or whatever. That's that has a huge impact what we realized that we need more live presentation more videos where people really can see the examples. And the second what we also learned is that we need to stay flexible with our dissemination activities as I said, we will change more into digital space which is pretty good for us. For a, because people can see it now and what we will s w slow the process of getting produced print materials or whatever we will put more effort into the digital space. And that's therefore comes the third point we will create more content for social media we will create more content for our blog. As I said video examples etc to see or to to to to let people better experience the the potential and the function of the. Okay that's all.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah thank you. One thing that I would like to to to change in your pronunciation is the name of the project. There are multiple ways of of pronouncing it but we we decided at the beginning to to strictly stick to PROJECT3.",
            "Oh sorry.",
            "The reason is to the PROJECT3 so that to and that's PROJECT3 sounds like ELITE which is a better connotation so that why we always pronounce.",
            "Okay PROJECT3, PROJECT3, PROJECT3.",
            "PROJECT3 yeah yeah.",
            "Okay okay, sorry for that. Okay PROJECT3.",
            "And then I'm I'm happy to hear that you have so so good like response from the online that you are running. But I would like to ask a not for the reviewers can ask the same question but I'm I'm mainly want to ask the how do we as the consortium benefit from that, so what can we as a consortium get from from this.",
            "Yep, what we always do is, we explain people how this concept works together, so what we do that we are part of sorry of an European project we we name it PROJECT3 project. We name the universities and we also tell them when we send sales we always send the website we send the media channels so that we bring their attention to PROJECT3.",
            "Yeah and and what you are are you showing the transcription the live transcription or not?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So but but then is I guess Google based right?",
            "Yeah yeah it actually is at the moment.",
            "Yeah so that is t you don't have to say this in the review.",
            "And and and the way I handle this is I always say that the dissemination goal of the project is actually broader than to disseminate it own results only. Its also to disseminate the the strength and utility of natural language processing as a field. And if do this twist then suddenly yes, I Google is not my anymore and there actually friends at google. So, so that's the that's the way but still whenever there is a chance I think that we really should try to promote our specific technology. And so its its good that you are bringing attention to to the to transcription and you also mention translation as well right. But there would be also there are things that are specific to our project. And these are the multi target so the the like the conferences where you have many target languages and you are delivering speech to to many people at once. We also have the live session like in in person meetings. And that is different from Google online services so then there what comes in is the actual physical setup connecting the wires and. There is a fair bit of of experience there as well. And that's that's something which which requires attention in way we have done that. And the the presentation can be also like a specific interest especially for for these events so imagine that you would be selling the idea that we have for the ORGANIZATION2 congress. So once people start meeting again in person and they will be international audience, you want to show screen with subtitles in many languages, and this is something that Google doesn't offer of of of the shelf. So that's that's these are things related to the to just the ASR and translation speech recognition and translation of that and, their specific to PROJECT3. And the other thing which is specific is the goal for minuting, so automatic summarization of of meetings. And there we would be really happy if if you persuated any of the companies that you talked to to provide data so please get in touch with PERSON13 she is on the call now at at the moment as well. If people want the their meetings to be not only transcribed but also summarized automatically if they want minutes to be written for them. They simply have to donate the data otherwise the technologies will not appear. So so ask for that we can do any sort of negotiation we can we can keep the data restricted to certain class of users such as researchers under some like signatures of contracts. Or we prefer to make this data publicly available because then even for example the competing companies could pickup these data sets and train systems in 10years from now and and make them better. So we prefer public availability but if the donator that the donor of this of those data sets has restrictions we are happy to to play around like to to do exactly what we are allowed to.",
            "Okay.",
            "And not more. And so that is the the data acquisition for for minuting. And also yeah we are happy to do a delay so if for example some internal company meetings are I understand they are very sensitive but I can imagine that if we put 5 year ban on them and make them public in 5 years from now on. They won't be anymore sensitive unless some like really critical matter was discussed. And this is obviously up to the one who has the meeting to decide, well this was just a normal project meeting we we like we didn't disclose anything bad in we didn't discuss anything risky which would kill our company potentially. We were just discussing things that could like allow our competition to no more about us. And if its only this competition thing, then within 5 years everybody will know. So the the content of the meeting will be totally like irrelevant for any competition advantage in 5 years from now. So that's with this thinking I think its possible to to get the data from from the companies. So this is this is something that I would really like to add it to your agenda to add this call for data for minuting. Because minuting is it doesn't work, we don't have the technology yet, but we are working on that and we cannot really proceed if we don't get the data. And this minuting technology that will be distinguishing something that PROJECT3 has and and Google doesn't. So yeah. So this is what has to be presented not to the reviewers now but to to the companies that you are talking to.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Yeah, I really want to benefit from all the activities that you do because you do a lot of marketing but I don't any single result of that. Show me show me the lin the hits on our webpage which are thanks to your activities, I want to see them from in the log files. The and I fear that there will be too few and at that's that's a pity. So, because you do this I'm like I'm sure that you have these talks but I think the whole consortium needs to benefit from that and not just yeah. Not just the wow effect that that you delivered, the wow effect is good but the it it has to be useful for for the whole of PROJECT3.",
            "Yeah yeah got it hum.",
            "And and other thing is you mentioned video presentation, I think that we have quite some video material collected. You have seen the demo that PERSON9 ran.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is something that it cannot be really rebroad like you cannot reupload it because it is based on Youtube video.",
            "Hum.",
            "But you can surely show it during your like person to person conversations. So please get this video from PERSON9, because it illustrates how the how the like remote translation works and and it translates from some strange language that Google doesn't support if I'm not mistaken for for Youtube videos at all.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So the that this would also be be good. So to to put it short I think the presentation that you had was was very good. It needs a fe there was there were a few more typos but that's.",
            "I will look into it.",
            "Otherwise it it was good but I'm I'm really concerned about the benefit that the consortium has from your dissemination activities. Because you are yes as a as a side effect of PROJECT3 ORGANIZATION6 has this link to to transcription and translation that's great. But its again the the nasty US company that's going to get the money for that. And it that should not be our final like accomplishment.",
            "Sure sure. What I will change from the slides is that I will be more approach specific. What what I want to do demonstrate now that all this presentation are just possible because of the participation of PROJECT3, that's what I wanted to show but I understand what you say. I have to be more approach specific I will change this to to frame it more to the to the to the.",
            "Yeah its not that much the the presentation now. Its the presentation to the companies.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I need to, i need you to change. So its, just mentioning that there is some university that does some fancy research is not going to help much. Like they they will forget or they will like realize that you have this button they will click the button it will do the transcript and Google will get its its sense per word. So its its good for the field of natural language processing yes, but it it kind of shifts the resources further more to the companies and further away from the university. So, because the resources are limited in in some. So so the more you promote the specific things the the better. So the things that are unique to to PROJECT3.",
            "To unique.",
            "Yeah and unique things are the conference translations, and needing summarization and then something which the users may not really understand but they like could understand it as well as the research part of that. So the the models that where we compete with google head to head the ASR models for example its difficult to have have gains there compared to Google but yes people from ORGANIZATION4 are doing good job there. They have the near human thing mentioned today near human ASR quality in the realtime. This is something which the Google doesn't have probably. And, for translation again head to head competition is hard so for the languages where we work we are better than Google so the yes. The Google wins on across the board, because they do everything. But for any specific pair any of the research partners in the project will do better. So that's another thing that you need to to highlight to the end users. They can be happy with the of the shelf online services or they can get in touch with some skilled partner, and with their data they will and or just with targeted focus on their domain. They will get better, they will get a better performance.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So that's the ASR and MT these things where we compete head to head and there every specific niche we will be better because we can afford the focus, while Google cant afford the focus, or Microsoft cannot afford the focus either. And we have the specific settings and specific applications and the specific is the conferencing so, few languages into many target languages and the meetings summarization for which we need the data. And what else, what else is unique, I think that's that's probably the most important things. So so I don't think that you need to change anything in this presentation. But I think that when talking to the companies really make sure that the companies can get back to us, and I by us I mean PROJECT3 anybody from the consortium, or or the through the website somehow. Because otherwise we just the don't know what you told them, so we don't have a u I'm not aware of any any single company who would ask me and contact me because they heard something in your presentation. Its a its a shame.",
            "Maybe maybe we should we should its its not maybe we should think about creating a specific landing page on the website because what what I see is. The people want to have this easy solution companies they want easy solution and what I think it would be way more easier when we can send them on the website a kind of summary where we say okay these are the people working on the project, these are the goals etc. We we have this on the website but we don't have this on a single page. So when we when we could do an appointments together where we say okay what I totally understand you PERSON11 said that we need more feedback from the companies. So then we should maybe produce one landing page especially for companies.",
            "Yeah yeah that's definitely a good idea so and you talk to them so you know what they want what they respond to. You know what should this webpage look like and what should it say, so lets lets measure the the benefit from you dissemination for the project by the the number of or the of companies who fill form there. Like whatever whatever they ask so the the the easiest thing and the most important thing for us for the research purpose is can you provide us with any meeting recordings and potentially their summaries, the minutes for that. And even if they say no it will be a plus point for you for the dissemination. So tremendous if they say no then great you have at least told them that the research cannot go on without their support.",
            "The main the main point we also have in discussion with the companies are the GDPR stuff, they are so scared they are so scared about this GDPR. When they just hear that we need to I don't know what they think but they they always get big eyes when we say we need we need to process the data therefore we need your your recordings and whatever they get big eyes because they are scared. Oh what should we do, we have to talk to our employees and whatever, and the funny thing is in every marketing or sales presentation we show the live transcription everyone wants to have it and till we talk about the contract when we talk about GDPR. I guess we lose 97% of potential people because they they they think that they think its they they really think they can keep the data and that the system should process on their servers. They have really crazy expectations.",
            "Well this is technically not a problem it is a technically a problem for Google. But not for us its its quite reasonable for us to make the systems offline in the sense that we will deliver it to them, and that will run on their on their hardware and will never ever once deployed never ever send any data anywhere. But for the purposes of training, especially for the automatic summarization of meeting there is insufficient data out there. In the whole internet we have tried to search for project meetings and there are not there, so they have to donate something. And if they do, then again yes we can make the systems totally offline, but Google cannot. So the this is another selling point of of everybody all the all the partners in the in the consortium. Sorry sorry we really yeah.",
            "I I would like just to ask the one bit of information because for one of our customers, we ended up solving these GDPR issue, by proposing a segmentation of the audio providers. So we added up by asking audio segmented in 22 30 seconds segments. So with random we shuffled in order to let me say avoid the possibility to recreate the information from the from the let me say let me say anonymize segments. So its not really anonymized but its, accepted.",
            "Yeah yeah so this is one of various possible ways how to make an agreement how to find solution which is acceptable for both the research and the the owner of the data, and its its the this is a great example, I I like that. It works very well for the ASR so training of speech recognition, it will be difficult to come up with something like that for the minuting summarization because there for for the meeting summarization for the minuting. There we really have to know what was the talk about in to in order to train. But there again different t specific agreements could be made such as the one I proposed the 5 year delay, and the 5 year delay is is like, it seems stupid now, to collect data that will be releasable only in 5 years from now. But I'm sure that in 5 years from now the technology will be still very under performing and the data will be greatly useful in 5 years from now. So it it make sense from the research point of view, and it hopefully increases by 1 or 2 percent the the amount of data that we can gather. So I think that and and the again the so so the GDPR that's one thing, but that should not be confused with, with the consent of of using the data. So this really need to be discussed we have PERSON13 was like halfway, we'll talk about ethics the the next work package is on ethics, so PERSON13 will present something but we also have a new person on the team starting from this month. Probably she's there only to limited portion of time. But we will really want to make this one more outcome of PROJECT3. To show the best practice to like prepare questionnaires or whatever for for researches like us, to to create simple like flow charts. If you are collecting data do this this this don't do this so that everybody is confident that the data is handled well, and that should hopefully help also PERSON1 you in in talking to the companies. So I think this is this is very important I totally acknowledge that and I think that we really need to be in touch even for in like close touch and discussion. In one finding out how to best present things, how to avoid people being scared away and instead of just having this fear and and straight know to think about ways of how to go around it how to solve it. So that everybody is happy and PERSON5 made an example and more is possible.",
            "Do we do we have written case study want to that I can show to companies where we for example did setup their own translation landscape or whatever. So in in with PROJECT3 do we have a case study because that's what people asking me all the time, do we have case studies. Proof, we need proof proof proof.",
            "Yeah so well, what works for us occasionally is that a company comes and they want some specific machine translation task and they have their own training data so we sign and and with them and we do the research for them and a data is never used for anything else except for the research for them. So that is the normal like I dunno the the English term for that, but its like the research for a company that's we we we have label for that in in in Czech so. Or research something like that could be that could be. So that's that's something that works for for applications such as machine translation or speech recognition, that are already well researched so that in principle it can so that its reasonably works already with the online systems. If it reasonably works already with the online systems, then you can do way better if you do it for the particle customer and you are skilled in that area. So doing the ASR for customer on his data you can perform much better than what the online shows. And that's where it is this type of benefit can be seen and there is no problem at all because the the university never leaks this data that's yeah. Thats the normal contract between two companies in in a way. The other thing is like donating the data for research and that is necessary for applications which are not that advanced, and the meeting summarization is this not that advanced. And there the way I would frame is its like social responsibility kind of so the the companies who are happy to invest into their environment risking that the competitors can also pick up the fruits. But it helps everybody actually, so I don't know if you have also strong enough company to have that there is again an English term for that like they. On purpose the company is is like wasting some of its money on supporting competitors by giving the data giving out the data and the even the competitors can pick it up. And this the bigger companies know that it is actually beneficial for them to to go through this risk because the technology will be then developed faster by random students in at the random universities if you if you want to keep things too private, then you cannot exploit the free potential of of of the people around the globe. So that's that's the tradeoff. So you your risk some of your advantage on the market and in the return you get this extra free research power across the the worldwide universities. So this I think this is for a long discussion I've only hinted some of the, I'm not sure I'm not sure you were able to follow.",
            "I'm totally with you, it would be good if we keep on the discussion for example because he is person who lets and who decides.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What do we put in in the presentation so, I I would would say that we, keep on the discussion with more people from from ORGANIZATION6 and then I want you to to explain your idea. What we can do to support the and then then next steps.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah so please please get back to me with propose some some slots that would be good for your side and you know how many people of on your side are are and should be involved in this, and I'll I'll join and also. I invite for example ORGANIZATION3 especially, because they they will be probably very keen on on this type of like benefiting from the from the dissemination that that you are doing, that's my concern there.",
            "Okay great lets do this.",
            "Yeah, so please within week and are send possible slots and that. They they should be in month from now or some.",
            "Yeah I I will talk to France today and I I will tell him what we can do and ask him.",
            "Yeah yeah, because I know that you are doing a lot of work for us but we don't get any any benefit and that's that's really. And I see that there is you are really the the door to all the companies and we we need to get there, and if if with you if we if you say that only 3 person of companies still remain after you mentioned the GDPR aspect. That the privacy aspect, even with just these three percent of of the companies that you contacted, the reviewers will be extremely happy how how we disseminated the the PROJECT3 project. So yeah its its okay to have 97% of of like in this area.",
            "Not when we when you pay for the lead and for the presentation. 97% of the people but I I I I do get what you mean.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay great thank you PERSON11.",
            "So there is I don't think there is much to change on this presentation that's that's good. But make sure that we as the consortium get the benefit from your dissemination.",
            "Sure got it, thank you very much.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Okay I will end the presentation.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Maybe could we share the column view.",
            "What is column view.",
            "Oh okay. So well PERSON12 will keep trying and maybe.",
            "Yes and PERSON11 also remember. Remember that I prepared also the the a short video for online ex flow in any case.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly, so that's another thing, so so please PERSON9 please both these videos with the PERSON1 and PERSON1 should like surely present them, because ORGANIZATION6 was totally overloaded when we were doing these demo sessions and they were not even present. So they don't know what is yeah.",
            "I just need more bandwidth in order to upload them. Don't worry I will share with the participants.",
            "So they should they should look at it and incorporate these into the the video presentation they are they are doing.",
            "Ok ok.",
            "PERSON1 right? Or is he there. Yeah so hopefully PERSON1 will still listening I'm not sure.",
            "Okay so lets move onto the last work package, and that's work package 9, and that will be probably presented by PERSON13, and the new person to to join this topic within PROJECT3 from our side is PERSON7, PERSON7 who is on on the call as well. But still I'm presenting it here.",
            "Yeah yeah well you decide.",
            "Oh I'm asking PERSON7. Okay, I'll start presenting then. Can you see that.",
            "Yes yes it works.",
            "Okay well, I'm going to present the ethics work package and that this. This work package has been created explicitly upon the request of the ORGANIZATION1. And it is supposed to ensure that the project complies with appropriate ethical requirements. In the PROJECT3 project we collect a lot of speech data so the ethics should froze and drill seriously with the data which comes from the human participants. And we should tak into account both personal information the GDPR information and the content of the data we receive. The work package for the management is planned for all three years of the project relation, but the main preparation for all these issues during the last year. So in the last year 19 in 2019 we published we also published three deliverables about, the progress in our hand in issues they are listed here on this slide. And the idea of our activity is to take care of the data that we collect, so before collecting you and or speech data for example. We wanted to obtain by ethics so people compete authorities for the search with humans. To have these organized we have established two separate to help us with handling the ethics ethical issues and to control if we are acting correctly or has some mistakes in preparing the data. We established data protection of controls if we are okay with the GDPR, we don't violate some any GDPR and then we have created a three member ethics committee. Which deals with ethical issues human participants and the members of this committing advices on how to write consent forms so that our respondent fill themselves safe and sure would not be misused. And the members the members also command and approve the resulting consent forms before we give them to the meeting participants. As for GDPR we supposed to have no personal information in the resulting collect data. This is important and this is actually should be kind of explicit if the main this website we just talked about we can made a explicit site about and make it visible to potential candidates for the data. Any personal information that will be found should be deleted or anonymized before the public release of the data. So to release a speech corpus, we have to anonymize the voice which means to remove the speaker identity and as the result we get kind of distort the voices on ASR systems can be chained for. And for the meeting.",
            "Well PERSON13 watch out, this is this would be the ideal but it is impossible.",
            "Its not going to happen yeah.",
            "Its never going to happen, this is you are please have a.",
            "So we will publish the corpus without with all the personal data inside? And we we will.",
            "So the there was an interesting discussion at the end of the user and advisory board meeting, please try to to.",
            "Yeah I have it I have it I have but I have it yes.",
            "So at the end the this was discussed with PERSON12 actually there is no way at the moment to anonymize voice so the speech people will identify the person if they have the person in the in the pull. Then they will find the person with 99.99 like precision. So, we have two options for our meeting corpora, either not to release any voice and that's good, because we can live with the transcripts only, for the minuting that's that's that's sufficient. Or we could also ask for consent also including the voice, but that's what we are not doing at the moment, so I think that.",
            "We are not doing it at the moment yes.",
            "Yeah so, just to to so that you are you are not assuming that some technology is there which is impossible at the moment.",
            "Yes. Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "So this is I have have a look at the slides from the PROJECT2 meetings, there I also presented this work package and I had this like ideal and then it was like crossed out realistic. And this conference be might be useful here as as well.",
            "We should also have the recordings of the PROJECT2 meeting.",
            "Yes, yes, we have it is it is somewhere PERSON13 has it she she.",
            "Yeah, just I mean its maybe something worth worth being aware EU project.",
            "Yes comprise yes.",
            "You this is one of the things dealing with. Sorry?",
            "Yeah yeah that's that's.",
            "At the PROJECT2.",
            "Yeah and I'm mentioning the person again because PERSON13 is knows about that about the person PERSON8 and we PERSON8, and we have already exchange a few emails with him. So PERSON13 this is this is for you to like pick up or potentially for PERSON7 to pick up with you are too busy with this, but this is we do have the contact its just that nothing happened yet, but it yet is already a more than a year now. So. But the yes, maybe it would be good to mention this project on because the the commission is happy when the projects collaborate with each other. So the.",
            "So to mention that we are.",
            "In touch with people from. Comprised sorry yeah.",
            "Its comprised company yeah. And.",
            "Not company, project.",
            "Project okay. That we are in touch with the comprised project, so should I actually speak about it in more detail or rather not too much, so that the. Are we going to release a speech corpus, do we know that.",
            "So I'm I don't think that we are going to release speech corpus, we can train on it because it is a lot of non native speakers internally, but I don't think that its worth for us to asking for the permission to release also the speech data. And to release it as a speech data we can rely on the project comprised which we are in touch with. But to release it as the minuting data we go text to text and there we can can be good.",
            "Hum, okay okay okay. I will modify the slides, I will modify the slides.",
            "Yeah sorry to interrupt you.",
            "Its okay. Anyway for the meeting corpus we need to remove remove. But also from the contents so we should correct the text also manually to have the anonymization f as for the names and so on. And for the time being the anonymization process hasnt been implemented yet even started yet but we are in contact with comprised project and just beginning the communication. Well and we also we collect the recordings of real business meetings or real project meetings people discuss what they are what they do in the project there are some plans or maybe some results that they don't. Very proud of or maybe not very effective and they don't want to show to anybody so major recordings of the main speaking activity maybe. Also maybe because of many other reasons just people may not be willing to make the recordings because it makes it takes time and take some effort. It really takes time to send to work on that to to record the meeting to send them somewhere it doesn't work and then send it again and so on. So its really big work to to give the meetings and so from this point of view we have two purposes. We have described what we do and why we need the data, and how the data will have help the companies themselves and automatic minutes for example. And we should also convince the participants that they might also need so it we'll help them. And according to this we created the consent forms, which we give to the participants so these are Google forms for collect the data for minuting Google forms for participants and for meeting organizers. That are in the form of Google forms and the participants of the meetings who give out the data are filling this forms. And as for the activity in this year the ORGANIZATION2 congress has been postponed to the next year and that's so our activity in ethical issues this year or colleting the data for minuting corpus. So we took care that the participants and the organizers of the meetings which we collect consent forms and as far as we have mostly half internal meetings that are being held ORGANIZATION7. Its quite easy to collect in forms in but if we have more into external meetings some. And as for this new step, plans for example we have we plan to create beta data management plan for other possible external meeting data. We also plan to update some tools which help to store manage data during our project. For example about the critical storage times type for use not on the run they begin to use them but also to when they are supposed to be used. And this also should be updated and we also should start to prepared how to achieve at the end of the project. Thank you end of presentation.",
            "Okay thanks. So I'm I'm a minor comments thank you for the slides and and presenting them. I think its this work package is very much forward looking so we are doing something but we know that we should be doing better and we should serve an example as an example. And I also wanted to check PERSON1 were you here?",
            "Yes I am here.",
            "Yeah so this the LOCATION1 institute of planning that would be one of the potential use cases that you wanted as an example. So like talk to PERSON13, its actually my classmate through which we got there in the Czech republic everything work through classmates so. He now works there and and I it was possible so I was like allowed to to explain to them what the data is going to be used for and and how we handle it and and then after this explanation and the illustration of of these automatic transcription technologies. They said okay, yes, it is interesting lets try it and then they agreed that they will be giving us the data we will again have to get touch get h get back to them so we are getting the data now it was summer but I think that will revive once they have their regular meetings again. But once once we have the data collected we still need to get in touch with them again exactly and like double check that they are still fine with whatever approval will be but they are exactly the company now actually a public institution that we manage to persuade. That it makes sense to going to some risk because the the long term benefit is is there so it very much depends on the initial presentation the level of trust and then it can fail at any stage. Like their director can change and whatever and suddenly the all the annotation work that we have done on their on their talks would be kind of lost but it I think its still worth going into this risk because without the data you just cannot do anything so.",
            "Hum got it okay.",
            "So so please talk to PERSON13 and and check how the how this was established and PERSON13 is also just she she was not there herself she just communicate it with them by email after my single visit there. So yeah. So we we need your online presentations to have the same effect to three percent of the companies that you talked to and suddenly we would have three times more the data that we have today.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "And that would be significant difference.",
            "Also if we make this website and put very very explicitly the GDPR information it could also.",
            "Hum, we actually do have website PERSON1 are you ever of our block post on. On this topic.",
            "No let me have a look.",
            "I actually need some website that I could to when I'm speaking to this companies arguing the data.",
            "Yeah so the its its the the 5th 7th of May recipe for miracles to have happen.",
            "Hum.",
            "And that explains the minuting exactly, so this is this is the one specific aspect, its not the landing page, the the landing page is separate thing. I agree that we need we as well. But this is the the call for the data.",
            "Yeah. Okay I will have a look into it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then you have, lets lets talk together I guess the bring it to the next step but I guess the most important is that we talk with our CEO when development to to let them know that there are possibilities that are GDPR compliant.",
            "Or that we have the figure out what exactly to do. So it is an open question we are yes we are not bringing a solution yet, we are we just want to make sure that the discussion is not closed at the beginning.",
            "Yep, okay. Okay, good.",
            "Yeah okay thank you.",
            "Thanks.",
            "So, do we have any other thing that should be discussed now while we are all here? I think that we are all good like we have discussed we have seen all the presentations everybody knows what are their flows and will try to fix them during the rest of today and tomorrow will start. With the reviewers and.",
            "And the the webex platform that we used that from the month nine.",
            "Yeah I think so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah its the same platform.",
            "Okay so that should all be fine then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So remember people cannot copy paste URLs from the slide they are watching, that's important. So if there is something that people should look at because whatever webex is slow to to transmit the demos please paste that link into the chat window in ask people to to to to like click it themselves.",
            "Okay.",
            "And. Yeah. Otherwise.",
            "I wasn't really clear are we doing a live demo or.",
            "Well we couldn't test it today, so because the our cluster is totally by someone and. If we if that gets better during the later afternoon PERSON12 is here and and he will test it. We would do the demo live, otherwise its not so critical, because the the recording is okay. Except the, both the subtitles and also the faces. are jumping. So like the the updates rate is is too slow for for me, or.",
            "Yeah I couldn't really see it really properly either. But if its as you said if its possible to circulate the videos.",
            "That would be better I think that would be much better. Yeah so PERSON9 please please upload the video somewhere in any case and put some short URL into the slides.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that they so that people can run it for themselves if we go for this. If we go for the live demo then remember there is this it well, the live demo needs the the slides that I had. Like that you have to shift reload or this. So do we want to go through this?",
            "I dunno.",
            "So maybe maybe its safer to to stick to the demo, a video, and then you will simply say. So everybody please now, watch this video. I could play it for you through the screen sharing, but we know that it is jumping. So its better.",
            "Okay.",
            "If you like click the link yourself. And and watch it for yourself.",
            "Would you like I play also the online text flow one?",
            "So for the online text flow. This is that's the paragraph view. I think the paragraph view should be on through all the morning. And that's for PERSON10 to announce it. And PERSON10 should have already received the details from a PERSON12 right?",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON10? I see you are here.",
            "I am looking have the details and no I am supposed to announce in the. No from PERSON12 I believe.",
            "It was in the chat, wasn't it?",
            "But then its lost. On the chat on the previous call.",
            "There is something in the chat.",
            "Was link in the chat but I.",
            "We cannot talk to PERSON12 is sitting next to me but we cannot talk, I'll I'll give him.",
            "Hi PERSON10.",
            "I just said the the link via email because the chat from last time was.",
            "So okay I'll send you again in the meantime if you can take the same email that you send in the morning you might find yourself in the CC.",
            "I its the tinyurl, okay.",
            "Yeah exactly.",
            "Okay then that's fine. No then I'm fine then I've got it.",
            "Yeah cool cool thank you.",
            "Okay cool.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah great, okay, so we should have this paragraph view all the time, and that's for people to access the ASR quality at any point they like. And also to access the translation quality of that of that ASR into a language they can access, and for the. So PERSON9 think again about this launching of the live demo and I think its probably safer to to say that well here is the link and and have a look at at it because PERSON3 has seen it twice already anyway.",
            "Yes yes its another problem, I will I hope I will be successful with.",
            "And in that case, please confirm let PERSON12 know in the morning in that case paragraph view can remain running all the time.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I guess I beginning before going to the work package yeah.",
            "Yes yes. Yeah okay.",
            "And but you probably will send the link to the in that's the question how to do the, we have the tinyurl link.",
            "Yes.",
            "I can try it to put it on the chat for the reviewers or somebody you can.",
            "We will try because while you are speaking you cannot really chat that's I know from the experience.",
            "So its probably I'll put it on the slides but since you cannot copy from the slides maybe if you.",
            "Yeah yeah exactly so will will do. Okay so I think all is set, its a pity we cannot go to restaurant tonight which is the normal thing for review meeting.",
            "Well where we can go home and work on our slides instead.",
            "Yes, yes, that is good. I would have very much prefers to be like some bridges days, but I'm not allowed to. Yeah so PERSON12 you want. Okay so I think that's everything and we can work on the slides as as said. So thanks for all the preparations, and talk to you tomorrow morning the Web X link is there for the first session and for the second session it will which is probably the the after the lunch. We will get link later on and for the conclusion it will also get the link later on. PERSON1 PERSON1 I will just to mention I will have later test of the Web X with PERSON9 and with PERSON9 just to see the presentation works for the sake of. For the for everybody where is a free Web X tier where everybody can join and can have maximum 50 minutes calls with up to 2 participants. So that.",
            "So if you put if you could paste this link at the beginning of the agenda Google doc.",
            "Yes.",
            "So that people can test it for themselves that web X works for them that would be useful.",
            "Yes sure.",
            "Yeah. Okay so great I think that's that's it, then. Then hopefully the reviewers will like the presentations and yeah, will see.",
            "So did you did you say its going to be a new set of reviewers?",
            "No, I think the same ones.",
            "Same ones okay.",
            "I'm yeah.",
            "Then see you tomorrow. Thank you.",
            "Thank you see you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",

            "Thank you. Unfortunately, I had very little time today. And even more I so I brought my bicycle to the service. So I have to go buy food. And takes a little bit more time.",
            "Yes, sure. So I will give give the update from my site.",
            "So PERSON4, I throught like seven different challenges in the in the speech community.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And maybe I will saying the you all the repaired. So then the the data varies from task to task.",
            "Of course. It's naturally.",
            "It is yeah. So it is like for some task it was like 90 000 hours of data. So and for some task it was 80 000 hours training data. And when evaluation data.",
            "So if really ready from task to task.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So but.",
            "Did you analyse did you analyse only speech data?",
            "Yes, yes. These are only on speech data.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, so like trying to do now is like I'm trying to finding some dialogues summarization kind of data. Because the like very different from us.",
            "So I don't know that how some one challenge it was the challenge. It was it was it was based on some it was late once. So it was for dementia recognition to spontaneous speech, It was speech recognition.",
            "And then there was a challenge it was for zero speech. So if had data. But like the main idea was to do learning. So the data set was really less. Size of the da of of the data. So 70 that released some data that we from to our minutes to 50 hours. And can you hear me? Halo.",
            "Yes I just didn't get last sentence from what minutes? From 20 minutes? What did you think them.",
            "To our 30 minutes to 50 hours because the data some.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "But this this are not meeting so for us it's it doesn't matter.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So I'm trying to find like more shared task for our task so I.",
            "Well, as you are speaking as you are as you are speak as you are same what you are saying I just understand that we will just release what we can release. So we can not do anything, We can so we can it seems that it is still realizable that our data is not so little. We will and I also have some new information - say you now, So we will we will can we can extend the data quite significantly.",
            "Yeah, So this this this idea is really good, Like to do on ORGANIZATION3 data, And since there are more structured so the quality of our data would be better. And also the problem that we challenges that would. Because the ORGANIZATION3 data is public available.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I think.",
            "So may I may I spea yes, May I speak a little about ORGANIZATION3 dat ORGANIZATION3 data?",
            "Yes, sure. It's it's going.",
            "So the the last thing we just last thing, PERSON4 from.",
            "Yes.",
            "To the there was another challenge from steps will where did provided so ground should data should training and development set. And aditional for the evaluation data.",
            "Could you write it down please in in in to.",
            "Okay, so so we PERSON4.",
            "Write this into mail. Which doc?",
            "I have of the valiable.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So let me sending then that would be easier to our?",
            "Okay, so please going. You are telling some thing of the ORGANIZATION3.",
            "I just amount of data set okay. As for ORGANIZATION3 data set. So PERSON6 now clean the data prepared meaningful there with difference size of meeting. We will get to that a little bit later. And I I have found that ORGANIZATION3 meetings also have minutes. And this minutes are foundable so we can find for these meetings we have. Based in on chapter ID and dates of meetings which are in the name of in the names of the files we can find minutes. And if you could look at the agenda for todays talk, You can you can find the link to the example. Who PERSON6 are you there?",
            "Yes, I'm here.",
            "Could you go to the agenda please? I also please ask you to all our calls use the agendas. So that we can kind get kind of all have do what is going on.",
            "So what where find the agenda?",
            "You will always find it in your c ORGANIZATION4 calendar in the reference to the meeting. If you go.",
            "Ooh, okay.",
            "You al you always find the link to the meeting, And the link to the agenda.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "Are you there?",
            "Agenda yes,. So yes.",
            "Somewhere in between. There is a ORGANIZATION3 meeting at example of minutes. So please open that this link. And look if it is okay with this example. So there are rearly example so they are really kind of short meeting is short minutes all the meetings. And we actually do not need to annotate them again, But we can extend then find them. So it will take time off. So it's really I task I would probably more likely asked the annotators to do than to do myself, But if.",
            "Yes, maybe I I'm not sure if it is minute.",
            "You don't like.",
            "I'm not sure it's.",
            "Oh, which one is the minute?",
            "So the this it contains six lines report on fall all up bla bla bla the yeah the young introduce their meeting.",
            "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.",
            "It's really not very good, The.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Bla, bla, bla. They the...",
            "They are just but sections sections. So.",
            "Well, actually I have looked that the 10 minutes ago, Probably. I have just to spend some minutes for that. And I didn't the details. Probably we can find.",
            "No, no, no. So I think it.",
            "We can find probably we can find something more. So maybe this is just a short, And there is there is something more, Yeah on.",
            "So I think it's it's. Oh it's cool I mean you go to the next the run minutes for each paragraph for each yes, For each section, So where 24 sections. And run minutes for each section.",
            "Where do you see it?",
            "Yes, yes, it's it's completly.",
            "It seems nice.",
            "Where what do you. May I also see what you see?",
            "You have to go to the next full text, You can full text there and you will find it.",
            "Ahaaa. Ahaa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So but point this this example do we have can we find is there such an example for all of those.",
            "Yes, yes, we have all ORGANIZATION3 commu meetings for.",
            "Yes.",
            "But for all ORGANIZATION3 ORGANIZATION3 meetings, And there are if they are much more than the just ORGANIZATION3 corpus. The ORGANIZATION3.",
            "This is this is very structured and.",
            "So. Yes, you are at this point there is still some lot of work to do manual work to do for annotators. But we we have to know, we have to plan the now we have to really plan annotators. Because we would give them s the whole transcript. And this website with this minutes. And then they will have to somehow.",
            "So this yeah this was the idea.",
            "Something.",
            "This was the idea. And now if we if all of us agree that we take the the minutes as they are, Or if the ha. If we should change them somehow. And if we take them as as we are what we want to get as the output. So some basic samples of of the PERSON6 do producer an example. And the size of the meetings. The size of ORGANIZATION3.",
            "So ORGANIZATION3.",
            "The they are really differentthe minutes. And different so it's another part of the data set with is which is not identical, What we already have. But this.",
            "But the problem is the problem is to match this minutes the to match this minutes with the whole meeting like.",
            "Yes, yes. This is what I say, We shou we have to do. So we have to find transcripts from ORGANIZATION3 for example, That we want to get minutes for. And give the task for the annotators the find and they correspond in minutes.",
            "So probably this?",
            "You can find it so they are searchable.",
            "So yes the results to the PDF doc difference form that's okay, But I don't know how to navigate from this meeting to another. So this is 11 on October 11 2006 so there is not.",
            "And this October 11 these 24 kind of minutes are different chapters.",
            "Yes, The different chapters of the entire discussion.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So they a very long like yes they are one one day session for the ORGANIZATION3. And there are.",
            "Well just a moment PERSON6 just a moment. This is what I have written in the gender say, So you have excerpted sound articles. For example, if I look at the document just just wait a little bit I will presented. PROJECT1 minute with ORGANIZATION3 I will share the screen share the screen yeah. Can you see my screen? Probably yes. PERSON6, are you there?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so here is your so here are the folders from ORGANIZATION3 you excerpted.",
            "Yes on the source data.",
            "Yeah, I have just opened something.",
            "And open this and found this file. ORGANIZATION3 06 11 20.",
            "Yes.",
            "Than I just copy that here, I opened it. And.",
            "Oh, so we have it. Yes, so the data.",
            "Yes, this is from our data, I have opened it I.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I I found the name. And this is probably.",
            "Okay, so, so. The annotators can just look at the file names and.",
            "Yes we can just excerpt some group here. We can just excerpt some folders say for each annotator for example. And he will from these files he will create basics samples. Use it them in minutes he will find. So they are not long. So for for this file, We have of minutes.",
            "So will they just just grab the where that say.",
            "I didn't understand you. What you scrap.",
            "They will just webscrape the annotators will websites.",
            "Yes, yes. So they they their input will be this file. And they will open it find the name search for the minutes. And create the new output which already contains this files on this copy-pasted part. And plus say summary and copy-pasted part if what is there.",
            "So yes, I the chapter these right now. So in the don't have a chapter ID, It's just one chapter. In that day let say. Or that meeting.",
            "Yeah, oh is it does it happen that in one file contains more then one chapter?",
            "No one one part is only one chapter.",
            "Aha.",
            "But the several chapters to one date.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, This is this is a chapter ID 1, to review.",
            "Not with many chapters yes, yes.",
            "Ahaa, okay.",
            "Chapter ID 87, 22 and.",
            "Chapter.",
            "Also I can that the minutes are could be downloading files.",
            "Yes, yes, I also tried that. I I opened the minutes okay, It doesn't matter actually.",
            "Yeah, good.",
            "But it's good to know. So what can we take out? I propose that we create that maybe that we create the folders with files of the link minute. But we should decide how much data we need. So this is our how much meetings.",
            "We should decide what, what PERSON4?",
            "The amount of data, How much how much such meetings from ORGANIZATION3 we we want to have, As much as possible yes?",
            "How much we can. Yes, yes, How much we can. As.",
            "Well, it seem that it is in in it doesn't have any end. It's really a lot of.",
            "Okay. So let us let us target at least 100 meetings fast in the fast goes.",
            "How 100 meetings it's not it's not a problem at all, Why you should decided beforehand, Is because of tdecides is because of there and how we choose the meeting. So if PERSON6 excerps if PERSON6 excerps the meeting which meetings which are 5000 to 10000 long well it's okay then if we finish we can start with other language.",
            "So PERSON4, I I can think of another challenge with this, Like if we can have differents types of data like some data will be fixed for short meetings. And some data would be for a longer version of the minute of the meetings, So that the participants could submit two models. One would be specifically for the shorter meetings. And another one for the longer meetings so.",
            "Okay, Why not..",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON4 with PERSON6 because you are you are.",
            "So.",
            "Screen sharing.",
            "Okay, what is the problem?",
            "Data, So why not we divided like medium size meetings, short size meeting then long. Because the the models the machine learning models that would work of meetings would be good for the longer one, so.",
            "Okay, PERSON3 do you have any idea, Do you have any idea we are short meetings end. And we don't meetings begin at what what is the border line, How many words?",
            "Yes, yes, that is something we have to late brainstorm, Or maybe looking in to the data. And take decides.",
            "I think I think you should I think you and PERSON6 may then PERSON1 shoud decide. Because I for me doesn't make any, So I can just say that our meetings are say about 8000 words long, This what's PERSON6 s computation. So our our I mean PROJECT1 as a one our meeting is about 8000 words long. And please make the border lines. And you PERSON3 say them to PERSON6. And PERSON6 will create folders according to these sizes. And I will give them to annotators. If I may ask you to do that to I don't know Monday to our next meeting.",
            "Yes, yes. Let me let me do a study. And will quickly get back to you with my study, Maybe back tomorrow or later. Yeah.",
            "Yes, so this is what we need first firstly. And then.",
            "Wait, wait, it's not to please don't go don't like. First we have the of minutes, Because I'm checking right now the minutes. And maybe there are not really what we need, So.",
            "So don't really go that fast in those thing, So.",
            "Okay.",
            "On behalf on behalf yes well.",
            "It's not really dialogues. So.",
            "Dialogues? They are dialogues, So when you look at the originals. They actually people do speak, So this they are not dialogues sence.",
            "Not spontaneous dialogues. I think. There are dialogues like but they are like each of the speaking something.",
            "Yes.",
            "But it doesn't not spontaneous.",
            "Yes, they are not spontaneous. And they are in different languages. I suppose. So if you look in a in the ORGANIZATION3 on the ORGANIZATION3 website, You can look at videos of they are meetings. And each first speaks in his language, So actually the these are not really dialogues, But short speaches.",
            "Yes.",
            "And this is the problem, Yes so if if this is a problem, We should just forget about ORGANIZATION3 corpus, And release our 100 our.",
            "No, no. I think the point here is to to have the annotators to give them these match. Lets say transcript. And website with minutes. And have them read these minutes of kind of.",
            "Maybe,.",
            "Spontaneous speech lets say. And remote this things for example question.",
            "Why do you mean by spontaneous speech? They can not make this speech in ORGANIZATION3?",
            "In a sence like everyday live speech lets say. Not this very strict formal language. Report of the proposal.",
            "Maybe, maybe.",
            "So this are not really very useful.",
            "So you mean well actually it's not so formal. I just read it. Introdu somebody introduced the report. Somebody spoke somebody.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, it's not very formal. It's not but it al it's also not very informal in it's very not very informative. You just get the idea that somebody introduced. But you don't know from the minutes what did he.",
            "Yes.",
            "And this is that the problem. I see more problem in that it doesn't contain any information.",
            "Yes, the yes.",
            "Brr. What are what is.",
            "Our meetings also as sometimes our minutes are also little bit that somebody report it. But I tried to make then annotators also reflected content. So I really try it. I I didn't always have success. And it's an so some to the minutes are all around the formal and not informative the annotators really didn't understand the context, But sometimes they are more informative. They are different. You I'm sorry, guys, I have to leave. Maybe you will think a little bit more about long about that. And I will then listen to that, Maybe you write it somewhere to the agenda.",
            "So I think PERSON4 you were required for discussing the data. So.",
            "What?,.",
            "Required for discussing the data. So why I would propose that go throught the ORGANIZATION3 meeting. And the minutes and try to understand that include this in our data set.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "And than give back give back tomorrow with our inputs.",
            "Tomorrow? No. Tomorrow not.",
            "Oh, tomorrow is sorry sorry. Late.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Monday, Monday. Sorry.",
            "It seems to be. But I can.",
            "And what about PERSON2? And what about PERSON2, PERSON2 because very to take important decisons about these things, So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You should join us you should join us in one of this meetings.",
            "Yes, But we can prepare our decision before he. So.",
            "Because you interested with the ORGANIZATION3 meetings. It seems so from this minutes.",
            "So I feel that you like ORGANIZATION3 meetings. At the same thing this time I feel that it is very different. And that's why we didn't take it from the very beginning, Because this speechs and not a spontaneous are they are in different languages. And so so on. Another thing that actually add should be also other sources. So it sure is to all the political meetings also have minutes. So it's not a problem to find a minutes of ORGANIZATION3. I don't know ORGANIZATION2 meetings. And ask annotators to make transcripts for that, For example, So maybe it could also. Lets really.",
            "And in that case, you can directly ask them to to summarize this ORGANIZATION3 transcript, To transcript already good. I'm.",
            "The point was to shorter on the worker of the annotators. So this thing that you found in the where this minutes the point of using it's, is not use it.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes. But if.",
            "Is use exactly as it is, Because it's not very good.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "But the transcripts, but the transcripts are very good, So very good transkripts and not very good minutes. So the point is to somehow plan kind of activity.",
            "But it's also not a spontaneous speech, It's not spontaneous speeches that.",
            "Yes, yes, the transcript some not very spontaneous. But there are well structure and minute. There are some kind of of dialogues. Some meeting dialogues. They represent some kind of real realistic meeting dialogues, Because not whole meeting dialogues are spontaneous. So they are there should be somehow included. Not.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.",
            "But not completely but the so the problem is how to plan the annotation proceder.",
            "Yes. It's also, yes, yes.",
            "This transcript check this transcripts procedures the website with all this.",
            "And then somehow produces better.",
            "Yeah better produces just more. Yes it could be done.",
            "This is the point how to plan how to plan the kind of annotation procedure that is create from the annotators but they have to like.",
            "Well. Oh. I think they can, So they already have some experience with creating.",
            "Oh.",
            "And if they get some some they can put more content in in that. I don't see any problem. So but we should take the decision if we do that. So we should be really.",
            "No I would have PERSON2 I would have PERSON2. It will about them.",
            "Yeah, Of course we we will take the decision with with with PERSON2 together.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So yes. So yes search for something similar like ORGANIZATION2, ORGANIZATION3 there should be some consider. Yes but but transkripts. And then I don't know.",
            "Yes, why why I'm speaking about other sources is because of different languages. So it's really very, very unnatural situation. As I looked at videos now. Because you see one person's speaken for two minutes, The and he is getting kind of translated to languages, European languages then another person is speeking. And that first third person required the English. And so it's really it can be hardly understood as a spontaneous conversation it's really on European languages.",
            "Within the minutes which like to something different? So does of the minutes are not very straightforward.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "In the ORGANIZATION3. So I've been through a couple of minutes. But some minutes are very, very different forms sponataneous meetings. And and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There are mostly.",
            "Because.",
            "Yes, yes. And no information just names names reported. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So clear I I'm sorry I really have to leave. And that's maybe let us make this decision on Monday with PERSON2. Lets prepare their idea, please pre both of you prepare kind of your opinion. What do you think and write it down to the agenda. So that we decided together. Yes?",
            "So one more thing. Now I guess we are completely the chat of ORGANIZATION4, So somebody please cripple down ORGANIZATION1 chat, ORGANIZATION1 hangout. And because we don't need it anymore. We have all people in ORGANIZATION4. Okay, So who is the administrator of this.",
            "PERSON3.",
            "So PERSON3 please remove everything, We don't need everything here. Right?",

            "Okay, but what is the point of deleting that?",
            "Because we don't need it. I guess, the content is already I mean, I think we have some importantly.",
            "Yeah, we we won't check word this.",
            "Why you don't would like to leave content in ORGANIZATION1. So. If we don't need it with deleted.",
            "Okay. But I think there is there are some important links shared. I don't. Okay let me to check.",
            "Yes, you can check a little bit. I'm checking right now. But some in usually it's usually zoom links that we already use like the previous meetings, Our spreadsheet that we have. I don't think there is something we don't already have. So that's the point.",
            "Okay, so this.",
            "Yes, simply remove everything. Okay so I guess we don't have anything else for today. Right.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, PERSON3 so we now we meet on Monday, right?",

            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi PERSON10.",
            "Yeah, so I'm happy that it works and I'm happy to see more people than normally on Thursday. So that's, that's great. And we have, the time is limited quite sharply. We should spend 30 minutes and then there is 15 minutes Slack of like extra time. But the session will close at 45 pas, at quarter to 5. So we must not speak longer. So thanks for joining, thanks for those who are still still coming in. I see that PERSON1 has already briefly summerize so, yes. So that's a message for PERSON6 who is also on the call, that PERSON1 is struggling with boost. In some way. And aside from that so I'll I'll briefly start with what I've been doing. I've I was with help of PERSON1 and PERSON11 as well I was running zoom subtitling and also I'm now using my talks on Thursday, my lectures on Thursday to do the subtitling tests. And we ran into new into new issue and that was simply one of the workers running on a slower machine, because the machine was swompt. So that's another issue that we have that we have struggled with. For unknown reason until it took us about an hour to figure out that we need to restart the workers and reserve the full machine for for them. And other that I'm supervising the the creation of adoble SLT test set, the forced alignments which will hopefully be finished soon. And I'm also. So that's you know that PERSON2 is, for example PERSON2 and others are working on PROJECT3 test set. That's what will hear in the second from them. The deadlines as heard that probably the ORGANIZATION12 will be in a year from now, so postponed. And that gives us more time, but still all the test set we have prove that our systems are not very good. Like not stable. And we have not done any progress in the multilingual setting like in the run where we have many input channels. So I'd like to ask PERSON1 when he he's talking to say if he had any chance to get to the mock conferences. That's would be a thing and then so that's that's one of the deadlines which got delayed by far. The other deadline that I wanted to mention is the adoble SLT task, which has the deadline not today but on the twentieth of April. So I still haven't updated the dev set but I would like to make sure that we use the splendid days to make better better submission than we've done so far. So PERSON11 has provided good baseline but good means that it runs not good that it recognizes and translate correctly. The the performance is very bad. Because it's a harsh test set. So that's delibered. We wanted to have the test set hard, but we should now try to to improve that little. So another think that what I would like to ask anybody who is working with the data, maybe PERSON11 is the the best person to know, he's not here but maybe PERSON1 could also remember. Or PERSON9 would know. We for for PERSON12's thesis we need Czech speech which is Czech speech which is translated into English. And I don't know whether whether we can ha find that in any way anywhere. So that's. If you have any idea, please let me know. Ok that's from me and I'm, so please start talking and I'll try to increasing the capacity of the room, because I'm afraid that with all loaded.",
            "Can I just have a quick question about the test sets? There was a e-mail like 4 days ago about the about the new set up of the repository for the test sets. And you you said that we should also put the ASR test sets into this Github repository. But did you mean just like the text files or like links to the actual audios on the cluster? Because.",
            "So the, you mean PROJECT3 test sets, yes. That is not related to adoble SLT. Please put there MP3 file, that are reasonably small. And if the files are too long, even in MP3, then please just put them somewhere to the cluster and to the repository upload some file which says these like a read me or whatever. These files live on ORGANIZATION9 here and here. Ok, ok, thanks for the clarification.",
            "So I'm trying to figure out if we can increase the the size of the room, but I don't know whether is possible. Yeah, ok. Yeah, so please now go fo one by one, to say what what you have done recently. And this doesn't really work. So whoever, PERSON1 I think I've interrupted you.",
            "I was basically working on domain adaptation and I basically run and issue with fading the language model. So basically I think it means establishing of the download speak and I'm. And see what he says. I'm struggling with establishing issue. Recently I've been. So I think that's all from me. So yeah PERSON9 you can speak next.",
            "Ok, though I've been mostly working on my theses for last couple of weeks. So I've been running quite extensive experiment. I have like a 4 different levels of domain adaptation of of the Czech ASR system. And I'm evaluating these adaptation levels on 5 different test sets. So right now I'm working on like analyzing precisely I have like a set of domain words from each of these test sets. And I'm evaluating how many of these domain words were caught by adaptation level. Yeah so so I've been I've been just turning many many experiments and mostly writing up my theses. And maybe one additional thing that I've been like partially working on in free time was like on functination system as well I have found quite nice implementation from this ORGANIZATION1 tool kit. So maybe I can I can send it to PERSON1 if you are interested, it's like it's based on model and it trains both the punctuation and the capitalization task. So I'm I'm it's like the version they have in their repository, it works for offline transcription. So there would. But but I think it it's very interesting I'm getting really nice results with this model, so maybe we can, I can send you the link or you can chat about it.",
            "Yeah, sure the Czech segmenter is not that impressive as it should be. There's lot of.",
            "Yeah, so maybe I can I will send you an e-mail after the meeting. Yeah.",
            "Or maybe put it put it to the surge document.",
            "Oh ok, yeah, yeah. I will I will I will put it in. Ok so I think this this is all from me.",
            "Thanks. So the next one could be whoever, PERSON7?",
            "Hi everybody in here. About as you know I think this week I didn't do anything. Just I. And I worked on the and and 2 different scripts for to get easier for other people when they want to run and do everything automaticly. And as you can see, there in SMT week, help me for this one, I think we changed a lot and examples and the code output and killing it and make it more beautiful. And now if it see I think it's somehow the last version. We can use it for your evaluation. And maybe if PERSON10 can help time to check it, we can.",
            "Yeah, yeah. This is on my to do list, I'm I'm failing to get to that. But I know, I will. I won't.",
            "And also, now it's using inside, so I think it's based on our conversation everything we wanted to do it's done. So it has a lots of impatient and we can, we should somehow. We can limit something from it.",
            "Yeah, so maybe PERSON11 would be the best person to provide additional test sets that we know how they behave. So PERSON11 not only has test set he also has his own SLT style evaluation. But maybe we should run SLT F on other data. So if PERSON11 can comment on this. Now or later. Ok, so let's move to someone further. So we had PERSON1. So maybe PERSON2. PERSON2 is now ready.",
            "Ok, hi. I have already app updated in test so yesterday I throw up an e-mail to PERSON5 and PERSON5 because I wrote an one website cult of justice of the ORGANIZATION6. And this we have lots of data for test, it's basically for ORGANIZATION6 languages. So I have started and to extract the, extract the data from this website using bytext. So it is running and before that I I extrated target data from the. What is the name, I forgot the name. But I have already mention in the ORGANIZATION9 SLT data sits. Independent audio reput. So. And policy data is almost finish and some cleaning part is remaining. So I will upload as soon as possible. So we can ex do experiment with English's police and because English policy is not available in the other ORGANIZATION11 19.",
            "Yeah. And I was curious what whether you have the the description for the annotators. Those who are already like in the queue and waiting for jobs. Like how they should proceed and where should they upload files, where should get, they get the files from. Some like, this management of annotators who will be doing the curation or the refinement of the test set. How this is far. This is this is like management work, but it needs to be done well because we have quite a few of them already.",
            "I have not prepared right right now. But I think I can send you by tonight.",
            "Yes, so no no not send it to me, please update the document which the annotators have also seen.",
            "In the gate up repository?",
            "No, they well. The annotators are people who are not very technical. So they, we have the ORGANIZATION3 document for that, that describes and also includes like one section or will include one section per language.",
            "Ok.",
            "And this is where the nor vision is mention for example. This is this is where we should have all the instructions for them. In clear but concise way. So that they know how to proceed. And the the sooner you get this the sooner you get in touch with them, the sooner they will start doing something. So then it will like save your time, so you don't.",
            "Yeah definitely. Because I spent too much time for the cleaning sometimes unnecessary characters. I don't know what is.",
            "Yeah, this is exactly what what the annotators should be doing. So you should you should like do the automated jobs and all the manual refinement should be then put them. Because it will save your time.",
            "Ok, sure.",
            "So that's the, that's the point. That you do the automation, you do the honey line and other things. Maybe the PDF conversion, but primary the honey line, the conversion of the ORGANIZATION3 sheet, if they are not able to to process text files which only very little of them would be. And then converting back from the ORGANIZATION3 sheet like the trick or two column view or 3 column view. And then to to put it to the Github repository.",
            "Sure, sure, I will do.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So that's PERSON2. Then we have PERSON11. For example. Aha, I don't know if PERSON11 can speak or not. So PERSON11 -",
            "He seems.",
            "He was writing to the document and he's yep. PERSON11, does it work? So before PERSON11 successful. Yeah. Does it work PERSON11? Or not. So then PERSON6, in like while PERSON11 is trying to connect.",
            "Yeah, ok. So since Thursday I have. I implemented the evaluation for for my multilingual model. And my all of my implementation is almost ready to, so that I can release it somewhere on Github as open source. And I'm right now trying to evaluate my multilingual model switch I have two of them. I have I have one for 42 languages and one for 6 languages. I'm trying to evaluate them on IWSLT 2015. And I will know the results in about an hour. But so far I have I have evaluated before on new test 2018. And it is giving me on on German English and English German it's getting about 31 blue score. Which is which is given that it's 42 languages I think it's quite quite all right.",
            "Yeah, so this is something we really should put into the pipelines. And have it tested in our way. And there is so far no standard way for us. So I think that I'll send you also the the link to the PROJECT3 test set. And I would like to ask probably you to to like, well. Yes, definitely you to put the edible SLT language pairs into this PROJECT3 test set directory. And then you and PERSON1 to negotiate what is the best way of regular testing of this models. So this is very similar what PERSON9 has been doing for Czech ASR. We need to regularly test the system, so your system and also the the normal standard deployed system on large number of test set parts. So like the test set consist of multiple multiple documents and multiple sources. And we need to observe this this progress. So I'll I'll include you so that you should test it on the PROJECT3 test set. Which should include the test set that you have now and it should also include our test sets from from the past. So this is, this is something that like will help us to to polish the test sets. Yep, ok so that's that's an important thing. Thank you. And what else did I want.",
            "Ok, yeah and for PERSON1, we were just discussing that there was an issue with with boost installation on his machine. So hopefully you'll be you'll figure it our with PERSON1 and.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Understand.",
            "Hi, can you hear me?",
            "Yes, yes, it works. Ok, great. So now is your turn actually. You can start talking directly.",
            "Yes, so, so implemented the batching for ORGANIZATION2 workers with PERSON5. And PERSON7 and PERSON4 process SLT F on my data but it's it's useless for now because I can't interpret the results because I don't know what is the definition of the latency.",
            "So please talk directly to PERSON7 and clarify it.",
            "And he replied finally that that there are too many because they are not decided which which one are use language, they will really use in future. And we didn't move from this part.",
            "Yeah. So please try going like one by one, and discussing what they are technically. And then help with the selection.",
            "Oh sorry, I think that problem is yes, there is a lot of numbers and but, but maybe some system which number is because, ok we have number and we don't know it's good or not. Maybe now the problem of PERSON11 is something.",
            "Yes. So we should plan to watch watch the outputs from in subtitler. And then you will see. And I propose to choose the the major from the ORGANIZATION3 paper. Which I implemented. That's that's the issue. And I have right now, I finish the edible SLT litter board. And I'm going to I can share screen with you. Can you see this? Yeah.",
            "So, so here at the top is the the values on all documents into Czech for the workers into Czech, so we have this rainbow. This is Czech from it's from PERSON3, and this is my Czech worker, and this is alternative ORGANIZATION2 worker. And this is the from the original speech. So from the transcribed audio, this is from the ASR. This is normalized so it's a flicker measure. This is average and this is translation lag in miliseconds. So so their lag caused by only by empty not together with ASR. So it's two point eight seconds late for the finalization of. And here here it's for German. And some values are missing for the ORGANIZATION4, this is the ORGANIZATION4 worker, this is again multi target ORGANIZATION2 and this is during that worker. I don't have this for and the latency for for ORGANIZATION4 ORGANIZATION4 is minimalise for now. But I I would need lots of work to improve it. Yeah and it's evaluated on documents and we have two references and it's very unstable so the blas cores are not not thing anything, for example this untercorp, untercorp to has quite very big blas core according, in comparison with other documents because the final, the very last sentence is thank you, and it was translated correctly. So one sentence has blas corp one hundred and it and it shift the average to very high number, but there are the others. Do you have questions about it? And later by e-mail and suggest the others to improve ASR, because it seems to be the the worst component in the pipeline. Writing a paper and maybe.",
            "Yeah, perfect, thank you. So I think. Maybe.",
            "Can I say something?",
            "Yes, please do.",
            "In the last 2 days I to the results and if you want I can run again SLT with you can see a better maybe result up it. And then we can discuss about that. If we agree.",
            "Ok.",
            "I will run just the results.",
            "Do you want my my table or. I don't have any updated runs from.",
            "Ok, so I'll be ok. In this case I will run and I will evaluate them and give you the new version of results and you can discuss about it later.",
            "Ok.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah, ok, so it's amazing, time is exactly 30 minutes. And I suggest that we really close the meeting at this point. Next week same time, four o'clock. And please double check the report from today, like whether you have added all the details and remember to to get in touch with everybody. I think we've done a great job in in the synchronization. I know that if there were other people, such as PERSON8, but he cannot make it at this time, not for surely, then we would again move a bit, but yeah. Let's let's keep up this this good work. Ok, so thanks a lot. And do the ORGANIZATION10 communications as you wish. Is there anyone who would like to keep talking for 15 minutes on the call, while the call is still running?",
            "Maybe if I could ask PERSON11 somethings about the about the assets.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so other all others who don't want to talk but PERSON2, maybe PERSON2 should be listening as well. So PERSON2 please stay here and PERSON6 you ask and I also stay in and double check. So thanks to all, thanks the rest. Yeah, thanks.",
            "Yeah, so what do you want to ask, PERSON6?",
            "Ok, so right now, basically, I have I have the IWSLT data set, which is just two examiles files. One in German, one in English, right?",
            "Then apairs from that, yeah?",
            "It doesn't have to be examile, you can have two text files. One as source.",
            "Yeah, ok, but but like I have the default examile and now I have the outputs from your ASR. Which is, which is like 12 or something text files with the outputs.",
            "Yes. One for each document.",
            "Yeah, for for each of the of the talks.",
            "Yes.",
            "And now, I'd like to somehow align it and merge it into one document, so that I can compare it with the standard data set, right?",
            "Yes. If you want to evaluate on the whole document, or the whole data set, then there is some.",
            "No I just want to evaluate exactly like like you did, so. Maybe.",
            "Yes, so then align with MWS segmentor, every document seperately. Then them. Then then run to the difference.",
            "Ok, so if I just them in the in the order they they are in? It will, I can run the between this and the original data set? Or or what is the reference?",
            "I can show you. I'm going to share the screen again. So here I have compact data. Can you see it?",
            "Yeah.",
            "SLT test 2015 and full. Yes, it's examal. So the reference is here. Sentence by sentence. There is this file order. So you must in this order.",
            "Ok.",
            "And then. Somewhere I have. But I have references somewhere else, where is it. And I think there are text from the excel. So I can pass it to you. And actually you can evaluate on more languages. Here. So in the ORGANIZATION3 paper, somewhere, they have link to to TED TED webpage, where you can download the subtitles for for any language which is available for any talk ID. So I downloaded references for around 10 languages. You can. And I have script for it. Which.",
            "I have the same data as you.",
            "Yeah, sure, I will find it and sends it to you.",
            "Thanks.",
            "And also removed the words in paranthesis, because there were usually music or laughter or applause and so on. This is not not spoken. I have a script which.",
            "And also I have been thinking about like how to, how to make sure that when you are translating para show para show outputs, how to make sure that the that it doesn't you know change wildly when you just add one one word to the end of the input, right? When the ASR produces partial outputs.",
            "I send you only the final. Hypothesis.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know, I know I have been just thinking about this. And.",
            "We evaluate only on the final hypothesis.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah I know. This is like a difference different think. So so I just like to hear your like your thoughts. I have been thinking about it, and I have like two two things that came to my mind. And one thing is that we could like use our data to train the model also with the partial inputs and we could use like a special token, like end of stre something like but the different one to indicate that that just the partial output. And we could like train them in sequence. And my second idea is that I could try it just initializing the decoder when when when I'm translating when I have like you know a partial output and then I have like the next output, then I could initialize the decoder with the last translated sentence. And maybe maybe that could also help to like have the have the translations close to to each other. So that they don't change too much.",
            "Yes, so you have ideas how to stabilize the output. How to.",
            "Yeah, basically.",
            "How to reduce the flicker and every others.",
            "Yeah, I haven't done any research of this.",
            "Yes, we have ideas but it works need implementation in PROJECT1 and C plus plus, in into the coder. And for example the prefixes are always the same, or the decoded prefixes are usually same so it will be good idea to cash them and start translating things from the prefix. And and so it saves translation time. And, but it's difficult to to do it for us in PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah, I also actually the prefixes. And actually discover that if you don't use any prefix at all, than it will it will produce a valid translation. But it will decide on its own. In which language each token will be, which means that that they will get the perfectly valid translation, like most of the words will be in Czech and just some of them will be English, but it's still like a valid sentence that someone might said from me.",
            "Yeah. Definitely. And the only way how to stabilize the input we tried was masking last key word of the ASR output from unfinished sentences. Because they cause their tail is usually unstable and this changed so much. So our translation is always five words behind or some key words. This simple which works. And the other some others translation strategies for long form simultaneous spoken language translation. So paper from ORGANIZATION3, and they put it only to archives and they have the.",
            "Could you say it again?",
            "The translation strategies.",
            "Translation strategies.",
            "Redetranslation stragies.",
            "Because I can't hear it very well.",
            "Ok, I send it to you on Slack.",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Yep. So there are still 4 minutes and then the call will probably close. And I see that PERSON4 has join the call. He's our intern who was supposed to be in LOCATION1 since the beginning of of March, already. And he won't be able to come in person from LOCATION2 at all. He's been supervised by mainly by PERSON7 and then partly me. So he is working on the forced alignments like running them and all that. And let me just test if the connection from PERSON4 is is good enough so whether it make sense for him to to join these calls. PERSON4, can you hear us and can you say something? Yep. So it doesn't look very.",
            "Time to start it in ORGANIZATION8. And I have issues.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is, you have to unmute yourself which is at the bottom of the screen, probably.",
            "I can't use any headphones because they have broken mike.",
            "Oh, yeah. So I just brought but you should you should order some new ones there's there is twenty headphones in a box now in our room and I put it to secretary yet. So there is plenty of headphones at ORGANIZATION9 but you're you're elsewhere.",
            "If you can send them send them to me by post.",
            "Yeah you know what what the post office looks like. There is a queue of of like half a kilometer in front of every post office.",
            "Recieving like one one letter from from Slovakia birthdays.",
            "Yeah, so probably it doesn't work with PERSON4 so let. I'll try to chat with him. So, PERSON4 can you say something, do you hear us? So let's see. Ok, so I've send in the meantime not yet send, this is test, in a second I will send an e-mail to PERSON6 and also PERSON11 and PERSON8 and PERSON1. On the test set, PROJECT3 test set. So I would really like everybody who is developing any type of system for PROJECT3, to move to using this PROJECT3 test set. The you will read that in the read me for for that repository. But there is directory called in this is and that's for and each of these correspond or contains the subset of files which are relevant for a particular type of evaluation..."

            "Yes.",
            "Okay. You're doing your master's and like second year, or –?",
            "No, I'm a PhD student.",
            "PhD student, okay. Because I was adding your profile in the –. So we have to submit all the peoples that we have completed this year for bonus points in our log. Like, you know, ORGANIZATION4 database and I was your profile and I did look for your like nationality and department faculty name. And I at –. I think it is still mentioned as you as a master student.",
            "Where?",
            "I don't think so. Our website should list me as a PhD student. I don't think I was listed anywhere while I was a master student, so I don't know where you – where you would find that information.",
            "Okay. Yeah, maybe something's wrong.",
            "So PERSON4 will join us a bit later, because he's on a data meeting, so I guess we should start.",
            "Yeah, so in the last meeting PERSON4 mentioned that we should clear the labels for our pipeline. Basically, it like a version control for the entire pipeline, so that in the later states. We can touch our systems – different systems against a later tester to check which one performs better. I mean, what different pipeline, which – a different pipeline along with different components, which we have heard within the course of the project. So this call will be regarding that and get to that. So –.",
            "So is the idea that there will be in fingerprints on the workers or I would do the labeling should do.",
            "I mean, yeah, one the idea, I mean, is the fingerprinting should be, I mean, that seems like the most plausible idea to do that, because –. Yeah – yeah I think so. The fingerprinting, the workers should be good idea to do that.",
            "Hi, good morning.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "I'm not sure how that works with the configuration and the mediator right now, because I think it has very strict fingerprint matching enabled, which –. If I label my worker as outputing let's say en – EN version 47.5 then I'm not sure that another worker that requested just English would be able to match with my worker. I think the – the mediator right now is very strict fingerprint matching enabled.",
            "Yes, it is.",
            "Yes, that is actually an issue for the WSLT where we are also planning to number, adding a unique token to a specific work.",
            "I mean, a theory that is, I guess, what you want, if you want to be testing specifaically different workers, but it also geos agains the – the idea of the mediator, which is that the workers are interchangeable. And that you just use whatever is free. So maybe the fingerprints in the mediator are not the exact thing we want to be using? At least not all the time? Or we need to relax the matching until we were actually run the test set and we want to be running very specific versions. Cause then you need also –. Let's say the ASR changers there are fingerprint and then we need to change all empty workers to accept the specific input fingerprint, which is not really the idea, I think.",
            "Just to understand the of the call. We would like to test different version of the ASR worker or also of the machine translation worker?",
            "I guess empty worker also.",
            "Okay.",
            "Well I guess all components also, I mean there's also the segmentation component that could potentially have different versions. So I guess you also want to know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ultimately the – the number of different pipelines that would need to be tested will be huge, but –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I guess, so as long it could be automated it should be alright.",
            "Okay. And of course we do not have sufficient computation to run all the required possible workers. The only possible fingerprints –.",
            "We're running – we're running the worker –. We're running the workers. The question is just –. So as I understand it, we would like to somehow label the workers in a way that it's obvious when somebody changes the worker to new version or that we can test it. So I guess also the – the different institutions were offering the same workers so we have empty workers and – and ORGANIZATION6 has empty workers. And maybe that should be visible from the fingerprints somehow so we can test a different – the different versions. But if we do add it to the fingerprints then that creates the problem that the downstream workers, the ones that need to request this output, also need to change the input fingerprints to accept one specific one. May be also difficult to test all the different pipelines.",
            "Okay what we can do maybe is to –. I'm I'm thinking about the possible solution, not sure this is the most correct one. But maybe we can for example name the workers, name the fingerprints of the workers with also the version info in the third part of the name. Well, the name – the fingerprint is two letter for the language, two letter for the country and then x characters for the domain. We can put the version in the domain part for example and from – in the backhand we can disable the strict match of fingerprints int the mediator, So that we will have less control on the – on the component in the middle of the pipeline, but w specifying a specific fingerprint for the input. We will still have control on the input and on the output of the pipeline.",
            "So, if I understand, we have – we have two conflicting goals here. So, ideally, all of the workers should not have to know what exact version of the previous pipeline is. So the empty workers shouldn't need to know what exact version of ASR is being run. So they don't need to change the input fingerprints. But also to test the specific pipelines you want to be able to request very specifically which version of each worker should be done in each step of the pipeline. I'm not sure that both of those goals can be achieved at the same time using just the fingerprint system.",
            "I don't remember, but maybe –. No, no no, no no, not. Maybe –.",
            "I don't quite remember if the API when you register worker to the mediator. Is there some other field like a description or something that is not the fingerprint?",
            "Yes, there is the name for eample which actually is –. It's correctly used to take track of the – of for example if it's worker or worker or so on. And –.",
            "For some – some versioning.",
            "Yes, but actually it doesn't affect the – the usage. Well, you – you never specify the name of the worker you are going to use. When you make client request you specify just the fingerprints.",
            "Is it possible to specify the name?",
            "No. No, no.",
            "Okay. So – so it seem like we – we can't have it both ways. So we can't have the workers uniquely identifying their version and still being able to connect to any – any ASR worker for example. So either use the workers all specify their version exactly. You can request exactly the fingerprint that you want and exactly the – the – the version that you want on the pipeline. Or you keep it generic and – and the workers are interoperable.",
            "That's –. As I understand that you can't have – have both.",
            "I think – I'm thinking about –. Maybe – maybe ther is the possibility to specify the full path. For example to specify that I would like to start with this worker, then pass the output of this worker to this worker and so on. For sure, there is not the – this kind of possibility in an cloud library. But eitherly – well –. But extending the library might be possible. Not today, not tomorrow, probably next year. Yeah, and I don't know if we are in rush or – or it's a kind of future request. We can reason about it in the communication protocol, for sure.",
            "On so, can we have another label, which –. You know, while being mediator, which could maybe how the version that we are planning to connect? And then somehow we would have to put that worker in – in the place that it is supposed to be. And – okay. So, let say not having –. So let say we have a final part of the worker is. So what we could do is –. If we pass let say fingerprint, so that should replace the existing worker there and for the time being it should be the worker. And as soon as the connection is dominated or –. And you the swap will again.",
            "Well, it's – it could be a manual process, not an automatic one. You have to shut down the first worker and then start the new one and then when you want to them, start the new one and restart the old one. It's – there's no automation in – of these kind in the service architecture.",
            "I would also want to add that changing the fingerprints of all the worker isn't – isn't very quick process, because of the doctorisation. We need to build the doctor container and it's – it's – it's more involved process.",
            "Okay. The the scoper is to evaluate different workers, different engines or different moduls version in order to produce kind of matrix regarding the accuracy of transcription and translation, is it correct?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yea, for example we have to run a test set over all the possible ASR the – all the possible ASR plus masine machine translation, so –.",
            "Yeah, there is.",
            "Okay. Well, maybe we can try to organise it as manual procedure. Ask everyone to – okay let's start all the version one moduls and then run all the tests. Then okay, this week all the version two. Actually, there's no – no – no possibility to specify version. The only solution is to modify the fingerprint but then we have to change all the possible fingerprints. And this is probably – this would require much more effort. What do you think? PERSON5, let me see the test we have to run. Do you have a program of your tests?",
            "No, so it's basically testing of our ASR workers and empty workers on the later tester.",
            "To see all the combination of ASR workers, segmentation workers and empty workers.",
            "How many total tests will that be?",
            "It can depend on how many versions of the workers we have.",
            "I have no idea how many workers –.",
            "Like –. The questions is not like about we have to run this tests more frequently. I mean – and these frequences will probably increase when we are putting the very input on Wednesdays. Because those dates will be a kind of checkpoint where we will be deciding what worker is the best for us at the very – at that very moment.",
            "This is the regular one plus manual – manual the window.",
            "Exactly. So yeah, I would add –.",
            "Yeah, yeah, because, I mean, if we have for a given language given input language –. Just two ASR workers and – and two empty workers that's already for tests you need to run and tell people to run stuff and turn off. 23: 03. But at the same time –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like I said, if you – if you work with the fingerprints, then you have the problem that your – your let's say empty workers don't accept the input from all ASR workers. Unless you change the fingerprints of the workers, which is also a manual and time-consuming process.",
            "And like also, what PERSON8 mentioned that we'll be loosing control over the workers.",
            "But this is like a bit kind of disadvanted that we – like that we don't – we obviously want more control over the mediator and the workers.",
            "Yeah, I think that's – that's the opposite of what the mediator is originally designed to do, which is –.",
            "Exactly, so they are meant to be more automatic and provide more control to the –. I mean to – to – to just, yeah. But having these like version control obviously –.",
            "Going probably –. If –. To make a kind of investigation in the en-clou library. To understand if we have other possibilities –. To specify maybe –. And – and manage another field in the fingerprint name for example. Or if there is the possibility to specify a full pipe of worker to the input request, maybe this is also a solution. But I think it's not something we can achieve in a really short period. Shat's your deadline, PERSON5?",
            "There is no specific deadline set that I'd know.",
            "Okay.",
            "But I mean PERSON4 has mentioned that we should get start working on that as soon as possible.",
            "He's quite a stressing what do you even start our approaching and we are ready first week of December.",
            "That's – that's quite, you know, quite – quite earlier.",
            "So sorry, but, you know – December –. In company schedule is really hot period.",
            "Thats's the end year – end of the year, so I can –. So I really – like –. Maybe it's a very stupid, but yeah, I would really to tell it. So how about running a different version on a different poat? So like we have ORGANIZATION5 dedicated mediator and mediator for – for ORGANIZATION7. So how about different poat, that will still be used by ORGANIZATION4 but will have a different version?",
            "Well, actually the the ORGANIZATION5 mediator hasn't been used for a long time. I think that probably the –. There are also no workers of that – to this kind – to these –.",
            "– to ORGANIZATION5 mediator, okay.",
            "And also we are really –. There is the possibility to run for us also other mediators if needed.",
            "Is – is that a possibility or is that not possible?",
            "Well, it's possible in my opinion. We can run as many mediator you need. We just have a restriction on making new public IP addresses now –.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And we are not managing directly the infrastructure. But we can use the same public IP address and put different mediators on different poats, yes?",
            "Yeah, but how is the solution different from manually starting and stopping the workers?",
            "You can start all of them and first of them.",
            "But th but then that doesn't change anything, you still cannot request a specific pipeline.",
            "Not mixing workers on different mediators.",
            "Yes, but – so, if you want to test a specific pipeline, you would make sure that only the workers you want to test are running connected to that specific mediator.",
            "Yeah –.",
            "Which is – which is the same – the same manual process that we've been describing, of starting and stopping stuff, which is not a variation.",
            "It's a first step in any case, it's a firts step. For example if you would like to compare just for example ASR, you can put different version of the ASR on different mediators and have all of then running at the same time. And at least run the ASR tests alltogether. It's not the – the solution.",
            "Yeah, that's not the best solution, you're right. So I can with this supports – we want to test one worker from one mediator and another empty worker from another mediator. So, yeah. I – I think we can create a pipeline that's – that is gonna use the output of this ASR worker from one mediator. And this will good, than one input to the empty worker from another mediator.",
            "Well, yes, actually, this actually – this mean that you're not going to use the service architecture main functionality, which is the coordination among the mediator. You will coordinate your pipe on client side.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, it's dirty, but it works.",
            "So, maybe –. Could you add these suggestions to the document, so that we can view it later? Or yeah, if the meeting is recorded that's also okay.",
            "Would you like I – I the – the – okay.",
            "But – but other solutions could there be.",
            "Well, what would be the possible time frame, if we need to make a feature request and something to empty to the mediator? That's something that could happen until I don't know the end of January or are talking about the end of July?",
            "I – I – no, no. For the beginning of the next year might be an option, yes. July.",
            "Yeah. I would not go for – like – July.",
            "Well, actually, also to me sounds reasonable feature request. I just don't know if it's physical or not. I have to – to check it.",
            "I – I guess the – the goal then would be to request the pipeline not just by – by the output fingerprint, but specifically by the descriptions of the workers?",
            "Or –.",
            "Description fields on the workers for – for – for versioning?",
            "Minght be interesting for example to specify the – actually the mediator works creating a path through all the workers involved in the service architecture, So that at some point in the mediator there exist data structure, which describes –. Okay, the first worker that we received data from client is this one. Then it will pass its output to this worker, which is the second. Then the third one and so on. It might be interesting for example to have own client side the possibility to directly specify this kind of data structure, let's say. Specifying – okay, I this worker first, then this one second, then this one third in some way fingerprints name, I don't know. Instead of letting the mediator compute the – the path based on just input and output fingerprints. And letting the client specifying the path. This is interesting from the computational point of view. It's interesting task. I simply don't know if it's really feasible. If you can wake make it working or not. I have to check the – the libary in the communication platform.",
            "Okay, so, that – that seems like what – what we can do as – as an inter solution we can have multiple mediators with multiple versions of workers starting and you manage everything manually to the client, And in the midterm we can see if we can extend the mediator.",
            "So, I guess – I guess that's what we can do.",
            "Yeah, okay. I even if we it manually on the client side, we still have the problem on how to identify different version of the – of worker. We still need to work on fingerprints, is it correct?",
            "No, I would use the – the description field, I think.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's the – the point of the fingerprints, I think, should be to – to actually allow the workers to not care what other worker they're connectiong to.",
            "Because, if you specify – if we – the translation worker their inter input fingerprint of English and it should be able to connect to any ASR worker that provides English.",
            "I think is – that is the main use case for the – for the fingerprints. And if we want to really directly specify the – the pipeline, then that should go over the descriprions of the workers which can have the exact version. Or I guess you – if you use the info field for the – for the fingerprints, it could go – could also go over the info field and you can specify when you request the worker to specific change of fingerprints including the – the info field. I guess that could work too.",
            "Actually might be the better – the better solution that you have like – let's say ORGANIZATION3 worker which produces English - ORGANIZATION3 and some other which produces English - ORGANIZATION7 and the machine translation workers except English. And as a client you could also specify, I mean, I want French output, but I want as an intermediary step specificly English ORGANIZATION3 and not English ORGANIZATION7.",
            "I'm – now I'm actually thinking, whether this might not even be possible right now, because you can – you can request multiple output fingerprints. So if I started the client and requested English ORGANIZATION3 and French –.",
            "But mediator also has workers ASR worker, which produces, let's say, English ORGANIZATION7, would that client request all the the ORGANIZATION3 worker to pri to be prioritazed? Or would that be a –. Or is there a conflict with the settings of how closely the fingerprints are being matched? So, I – I think that would be worth actually trying.",
            "Okay.",
            "Making sense.",
            "I think that probably we have all to reason about al about this topic. What we like to meet in a couple of days in order to let us –. Me, for example, check on the en-cloud library, if we have some possibility, some additional pssibility. And maybe make a tod together a test of these possible first solution in order to check if we really have problems in practice or not. What do you think?",
            "Yes, we can do that, I thing.",
            "So I think definitely one experiment that you should try is to start the client and explicitly request all of the intermediate fingerprints, including the – the – the last field, which is just for the information and the versioning. That might already allow you to request almost specifically the pipeline that you want, so long as the worker have – have these fingerprints.",
            "Different workers already have different fingerprint, so I'm actually like –. Right now, can we do?",
            "I mean, just – you can just try. Let's say, you want to translate English audio to French and you can request with the client the English k the fingerprint of the English ORGANIZATION3 ASR worker and French, And then run the client again with requesting the – as output the fintgerprint of the English ASR worker from somewhere else and French, And see if you – if you actually get different pipelines, reproducively.",
            "I'm finally here, hello.",
            "Hi.",
            "So, I to see that you are all on the call, And I don't want to interrupt the discussion, so, just go ahead. Don't expect any input from me.",
            "Actually we can test possibility using the automating web tool – here. Okay. Here, there's the – on the left, there's the search path meaning option, which lacks you – in your later possible re client request. And let's you see the – the – the pipe, which would be selected if you perform this kind of client request.",
            "I cannot share my screen, but otherwise we can just do this on the screen share.",
            "I think PERSON4 is a host right now and has to allow the screen sharing.",
            "Oh, okay, I haven't realised that. So, what can I do –. So PERSON9, more, make host – so who else would like to share anything? Potentially? PERSON8 maybe as well? Make host – yeah.",
            "Okay, so we have for example the – here is the English ASR from ORGANIZATION3. Just this fingerprint, and English from ORGANIZATION4, which is this fingerprint.",
            "Such path exactly?",
            "So – but with that we can only request one output fingerprint.",
            "Yes.",
            "But my – my idea would be that you use the – the client to request multiple fingerprints.",
            "And by that influence the –. Maybe I have the client somewhere, let me see. Okay, so, we can do – we can do it this way, once –. Share –. So, we should be able to request multiple fingerprints here.",
            "Specifying more minus remember.",
            "I think for this version the the switched.",
            "Aha, okay,.",
            "No.",
            "We have the strict match enabled on the actual mediator.",
            "Maybe it's not switch, maybe just. No. I'm just getting to –.",
            "Okay. So I'm going to check it too.",
            "But this was the – this should be correct. I'm not getting any German.",
            "I'm going to check, it's –.",
            "So is this –. I mean – I see – any English to German workers.",
            "Okay.",
            "Let me see if maybe my – maybe the English to German workers are not running.",
            "Okay. Okay, isn't for example English ASR, yeah?",
            "Here we go. Okay, so, the translation workers are replying. So, now we have some English to French workers running, And now the – when I request – the output fingerprint French and –. I see – I think I see the problem. The – the ASR worker is easy to control, because I just control the input fingerprints and output fingerprint of the ASR workers are all the same. They are en-EU.",
            "So the ASR worker there is easy to control. I can just change the input fingerprint. And the segmentation would not be so easy to change. But the ASR and MT could be quite easy if you change the – if we change the fingerprints of the – of the translation workers to include some – some version stream. Because the other en poitnts. The segmentation would not be so easy because it's the one in the middle, and –.",
            "It's b it's probably also the part that we do no need to check different versions.",
            "Oh, like there is only one.",
            "Where there other from –.",
            "Wait, yes, we use a different segmentation worker and have the student who hopefully –. Well, he's at the very beginning, but we have to have also some sound-aware segmentation. So that would – that would be actually full of complications pipeline, because he would need to get sound input. So, yeah. Let's not discuss that's – here this – this extra path, which needs both sound and text. But I think that also the middle – middle elements would have different versions. So for example we have this –. Now someone is working on some like filtering, so that bad verse do not appear in the output automatic ones. And that again could have different versions. So if – if we are able to make it flexible even in the middle, it would be useful.",
            "Okay. For the moment, the only possible solution is to manage the pipe on the client side. I was made actually for the – computational power, oh my gosh –. How is actually made full in order to use just one ASR and put the output of one ASR as input of all the possible machine translation workers. In perspective I would investigate the possibility on how to extend the en-sloud communication protocol, in order for example to specify a full path. I believe, I don't know if it's feasible, but I wish –. In my opinion it's something, which –. As – as PERSON9 explained is not one hundred percent compatible with the mediator philosophy, which is instead to have interchangeable workers providing the service. But, well, actually, it's something that could be useful aslo in other situation. It might be interesting to investigate details.",
            "So the interchangeability should obviously remain there and it does remain there, So it's absolutely okay and useful for others to have multiple workers which have the same version of the model. So, it's – this replicability that comes for free with the mediator is something that we really want to keep. And that will remain there, so –.",
            "We understand. It's jus t a matter of having more control during testing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I understand –. I don't know if it's feasible, we have to check it. Meanwhile, there could be this kind of intermediate solution –.",
            "Yeah, oh –.",
            "Making, because I have –.",
            "The – the possibility that I was suggesting that right now the – the fingerprints aren't set up for that, but the version that might work, and you sould investigate if it works as is without modifying any – any backands. It might be that it could look like this, so let say that the ORGANIZATION3. Asr works from en-EU to en _ EU-ORGANIZATION3 and vice versa the ORGANIZATION7 could – would have ORGANIZATION7 at the end. 'Then we have the – the segmenter, which goes from en-EU to en-EU again ORGANIZATION3. So the input fingerprint is the generic and the output fingerprint is the not generic. And again the MT would be en-EU to en-EU – to French. And then the client would request multiple fingerprints. If you want a specific pipeline, you – you can try requesting multiple fingerprints. So you can have en-EU-ORGANIZATION3 from the ASR, and let's say –. Sorry, that should be french ORGANIZATION3 also and then French from – I don't know from – from ORGANIZATION6. So – and that might already, as is with client as it is, might already allow you to request to the very specific pipeline. Cause what I'm hoping is that if you specify this precisely, then –. That you specificaly also one this output, then it will not allocate you to the – the ORGANIZATION7 ASR worker, because then it would have to do –.",
            "Yeah, could you – could you in the example – could you also add the like competing workers, which could potentially do the job, but we don't want to select them? And also what is not clear to me is the inut versus output. So for each of these workers or clients. So you are specifying that both ASR's input like digest English sound and they produce different ASR's, different versions of them. There could be some version number obviously. So, well, is that obvious – is there –. Can we as many dashes or is that like a third dash and f everytihing after in the third element dash the limited element – everything is one token, which is not for the divided? So can we –. Could you make two –. That's actually a question which is also very relevant –. I would like to see the ORGANIZATION3 worker for English in the mediator very soon, because in – on the third of December – on the first of December there is a metaphorum, which is like to do dry-run for. And on the third there's is something which I just learned from PERSON1 today, there is another meeting of the ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1 preparation group. And that – for that I would relly like to have the neural model, in which you – you have. I don't know if that is feasible on your side, but imagine that you have two ASR's systems. So, could you make two versions of ASR? And select hen with the fingerprint the – yeah. So it is already a dash, not –. Sorry, an underscore, not dash, right?",
            "I think tha I think you're only allowed to have two dashes.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, that was my – the – the answer to my first question. And now what I don't understand is – in the client –. So what – in what part of the pipeline are you starting the client? Because if – if it – if you are starting it from sound till the translated text, then you are specifying only the endpoints and not the middlepoint, which is neural. So that's – that's something which is not clear to me.",
            "So that – that's why I – that's why I think maybe we can work if you also request as output the – the intermediary fingerprints. That's why –.",
            "So the intermediary, okay. There are some intermediate. So the en it is intermediary and not input.",
            "The en i is the – i is input, which – which is contra-intuitivly the output. So the client specifies the – what it wants just receive with i, because it's the input to the client, but it's the input to the user, very intuitive design.",
            "And, so – but you can request multiple ones. You can only have one f, which is the fingerprint of the – of the sound file that you're putting in –.",
            "But you can request multiple – multiple inputs to the client. But like I said I don't know if this will wor as I wanted to, because I don't know –. If the fingerprint matching on the service is strict, it might mean the signature which expects the English EU might not accept this fingerprint as input. And if the fingerptint matching is not strict and it will accept this input, then I don't know whether when we request this fingerprint we will actually get this fingerprint.",
            "Yeah, so, because there is a risk that the client's request will be satisfied, the sound will be processed with one ASR and translated to French. And the input will also be pricessed with maybe another ASR and this ASR output will be delivered to the client as well. So client is going to receive two outputs, right?",
            "Yes, the client in this case would receive two outputs.",
            "Yeah, and – and you're hopeful that – that the mediator is clever enough that if we ask on two outputs that could be on the same path, it will actuall ycreate a single path and not – not run more workers than needed.",
            "Yes. So, I see the – the possible fails would be the fingerprint matching isn't precise and we would get a different ASR. It's possible that we would get ORGANIZATION3 ASR, another ASR and ORGANIZATION6 MT, because it cannot reuse that stream. I think we have this before.",
            "So for examle for examp we would also request, I don't know, Spanish, then I think with the mediator as it is right now, it would be allocating two ASR workers anyway.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I don't know. This is a – this is also one of the possible fails. I d I actually have no ide what the – what the actual behaviour will be. That's why I'm like wondering. Or it will fail completely, because segmenter can't connect to ASR.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Those are the – the three possible failures and areas that I foresee that might be possible.",
            "Yes. I'm seeing one more maybe, because I think that the goal of the mediator should be to prefer shorters – shortest path. So if you specify something that is longer, than maybe if it's even more clever it maybe should avoid joining the partial path you spcified by the intermediate outputs.",
            "But – but there is the shortest path. I mean, the path doesn't get longer, because I specified the ORGANIZATION3 neural. It would have to go through some ASR anyway. I ', just –.",
            "Oh, right. In this case definitely. Maybe with filtering for the boards it won't be the case, that we'll see.",
            "Yeah, if – if there is a shorter path available, then it will probably prefer the shorter path. But in this case we're not making the path longer by specifying more.",
            "Okay. And and this is the third possibility and we have to investigate it through tests together.",
            "Yeah, yea, yea.",
            "Well, the thing is that I will require right now changing all of the the – the fingerprints, because right now the, for example –. And it might not be necessary strictly at the moment, because right now the ORGANIZATION3 ASR –. So, right now ORGANIZATION3 ASR has the fingerprint somewhere. This one: en-EN to en _ EU. So the input fingerprint is different. And – so you can already select which – which ASR worker you want by just changing the input fingerprint.",
            "The ASR worker you can control this way. I don't think that the empty workers can be specified this way, because they have generic fingerprints. So, yeah. For example our empty worker ours is en EU to let say French without any – any signal.",
            "I sh I share with you also the fingerprint text file we created long time ago together with, which is also useful to have a look at.",
            "This is – this is ep especially important for the new people on the team. So, PERSON3 already knows that, but not PERSON5 and not PERSON6. So PERSON5 and PERSON6 please make sure to like bookmark it or whatever.",
            "So I – I – I think trying this could be interesting and would require changing all the – the fingerprints right now, but changing it once is maybe a huge deal, I hope.",
            "Yeah – yeah.",
            "We need to investigate how – how it is, because we want to avoid splitting to many versions of all workers. Because we haven't separately translator architecture and this one. But is should be possible. The – the thing is that one of the – one of the possible outcomes is this one, which means that nothing will connect to anything. And hope just not work.",
            "So, please, make sure to test it out, whoever needs to be there. I think PERSON9 you're the best person, but we sure should definitely follow exactly what you're doing. The – so that he understands the infrastructure there as well. And I'll have to relieve, because I have another call. Hopefully we haven't clash with this one, because it's also Zoom on my account, so I'm curious how that will work. But s independently of that. This is very important, the ability to select a particular worker, so I'm happy that you are like figuring out how to do that. We also want another separate thing and that's versioning. So, even – so, like all the versions indeed –. So the reason is that if for example ORGANIZATION3 has one neural ASR –. Yes, that's good. But we need to –. So the – idea that this is important for the regular evaluation. So, I would like the breakal evaluation that wishfully will be running to keep a record of what exact versions of the workers were used. And it would be even better to have something, which is like internally a version ID in the worker itself. So that it is like less likely that you update the worker internally and keep the same fingerprint. That would be bad for the evaluation purposes. So for the evaluation purposes we would really like to have deterministic behaviour, so that if you have a worker which has this commit ID, then it does the same thing all the time. And it's finer detail than just the same fingerprint, that the worker like assignes to or signs up to. So –.",
            "This is also related – is this related to how the partners implemented the workers. For example for what we do improvise the update of the language model – the acoustic models are completely unrelated to the update of the softer model which makes Yes. the –. Which is actually the worker.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I don't know how – how ORGANIZATION7 keep made the integration.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I think that probably we come in any case to this kind of problem, because for example I ca I can update my Italian – ASR.",
            "And you keep your softwer so nothing changes in the way Exactly. it's –. Yeah, I understand what's the problem. So, obviously, yes. The – the book-keeping is essential. Like if – if we agree that we want to know exactly which model is there, then whoever is publishing this model needs to make sure that the version of the model gets propagated to the version of the worker. But my question is whether the – the architecture itself includes any place – any any – any field in the startup of the communication, whether worker will say something about itself. And I don't think there is something like that.",
            "Well, this – the – the end – the initial handshake –.",
            "Okay.",
            "There is for sure the fingerprints and the name –.",
            "Okay.",
            "Description, let's say the –. It's – it's called service name.",
            "And probably it shares also other – other information for example –.",
            "Oh, so there is this service name. It's – when it –. I see on the – on the admin web, I see the service name by Umar – by PERSON6, at DLL something.",
            "Yes.",
            "So we can put anything there, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "This is a free string. Okay. So this is –.",
            "It's not shown to the client. I don't think it's even transmitted to the client. I don't think –. It's not – not a client thing where you can just say okay, I want to display it. I don't think it's even ever sent to the client.",
            "Exactly.",
            "The client never knows the name.",
            "So, can we somehow request this programatically? Like the –. It's – it's –. Actually this is needed for the – for the test suit operation. So, when we want a regular run evaluation of these – of the inputs in PROJECT2 test set and then store these outputs. And we want to label these outputs with this service name. So, how do we get to the service name when we ask for particular processing job?",
            "Okay. At the moment there is no possibility to do it, because it's all this related the fact that service are interchangeable and from the client side you should not know which one who – who is providing you the service.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But there is the the session ID. So, is this archive for some short period of time, so that like we could run the service and see which session ID was –. Does the client know the session ID?",
            "No.",
            "No, okay. Yeah >",
            "I – I think at least no. But I can investigate.",
            "Yes, I think the client knows some kind of session ID.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah. I think the client gets some session ID and we need to do some weird –.",
            "Yeah, probably its own session ID, and –.",
            "But – okay, but, I mean, PERSON4, what is the difference between using the – the description and – and noting the version in the fingerprint? I don't understand why that is not an option.",
            "Well, the – the example is – is here for example. The DLL six and seven, if you are looking at the admin web now. There are two PROJECT1 NMT systems. They actually differ the – in the fingerprints but it's – it's the machines from the cluster. And I can imagine that one of the machines would have different GPU card and would be slower for that reason. And we are also evaluating the – the delay. So, that would then explain the different behaviour in the – with respect to the – to the delay. So, it's the – the idea is that you have more information about the workers then – all the possible infromation about the worker without actually getting to the – to the other machine. So, for our workers we can have separate loads and like merge them – put them with – with the – with the same outputs. But for your workers we would like to – to have something more detailed. And I – I would assume that it's easy for you to do an update in the model and make sure that the service name changes, but the fingerprints will remain the same, because the – the –. If – if the fingerprints allow us the same flexibility, so that you can change the fingerprint on your side only and we don't know and the rest of the system doesn't know about it still works for all the various ways of processing, than yes, fingerprint is sufficient. But I fear the fingerprints have to be agreed on, so that it connects well. And if the fingerprints have to be agreed on, then you cannot unilitely change the – the detail about taht.",
            "So, this – the – the fingerprint is again like – we would trying to have a – we would trying to have all the possible ways, so –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We – we – if we have the fingerprints like this and we can request them specificall like – like this one –.",
            "Than that's, yeah.",
            "Then we get a specific pipeline we want.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then we'll be – then it will be completely exact.",
            "Yeah.",
            "At the same time for the workers to connect to each other they need to be reasonably generic. Then we also have the use case where – where is – where you can these fingerprints, which specify the service language, where you want the publishers specifically to connect to some specific translation from the service language. So I – I think there might be conflicting goals here. And yeah. I guess you could put the descriptions – put something int the description but you cannot request workers by the – by the description.",
            "Yeah, there is –. There is – there is what I was hoping for, that you cannot request workers by description, but you still get the description. And it's – it's also difficult to get the description.",
            "The description, then – then you cannot control for these – for the different workers. Then you cannot say that I want specific worker –.",
            "Yeah, I agree, yeah.",
            "We would need – we would need an extra dash to get the version behind.",
            "Yeah, yeah, which is beyond the the protocol so far.",
            "But actually not that I look at it, the way we've been doing that was – these have been – like this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So they are – they are actually using the second field, so there you can have the matching again. So – so you can – you can probably configure the mediator of the second field. The can be K – ORGANIZATION3 _ onSlowGPUv7.5 whatever.",
            "And then – then you can probably say that's – that this field matters, the middle field matters, but the last field doesn't. So – so ou could have it both ways and –.",
            "Yeah, so let's –.",
            "I think – I think in general the fingerprint system could – could do that – could do that and allow you also to request the staff that you want.",
            "Yeah. In that case it is better to use fingerprints read than the extra description, the service name, I agree. So I'll – I'll leave now, but PERSON9, if – if you could make sure that this test is done and that we know the answer, like whether it – whether the use case works with – whether none of these fails happen and no other fail also happen. And also I would like to ask every partner to label their workers with the date of whatever – of department. Something like that. So that this neural version two, that is something which is interpretable to you and ORGANIZATION3, but we have to talk about it. Like is it –. And if you say –. Yeah, exactly –. If – if you put there the date, then it's – it is easier to for – for us to immediately see that you have done some – some change. So since we are already changing the fing or going to change the fingerprints, yeah.",
            "So, can we put that in the service name?",
            "Yeah, I also.",
            "Yeah, can we put that in the service name?",
            "Well, the service name is already informative, so the service name does not control anything. And the – you actually see the service name onl in the – through the web interface.",
            "Actually, no, even in the dominal where I run the pipeline I can see the service name.",
            "Okay. So that is good news, so please make sure to record the service name to the log file, so that we can then –.",
            "Right –.",
            "So, do you run –.",
            "The translation service, so you get the last service name.",
            "Oh, okay. And not the intermediate one.",
            "The service name of the last worker in the pipeline.",
            "Okay, yeah. So it's not incom not complete. Since for the evalutation purposes we're going to do – well, we're going to do both. We're going to evaluate individual components as well as the full paths. The full paths will have like compound effect on the final performance in terms of the – the speed and – and all that. And these sparate components – these are for better comparison. Like which model to choose. So – so, for the case where we are running just one – one step the service name is there, that's good. For the full pipeline you have to rely on fingerprints, because you would not know which underlying system was used in the middle of the pipeline. Because you don't get these service names for the – for the intermediate steps. Yeah, –.",
            "And we get that from the ebclient, I mean, if we can the service name, the start the session whenever I run a pipeline or whenever pipeline. That would, I mean, just without pre-processing that would help us get everything that we need.",
            "Yeah. Wel, I'll leave at the p at this point, thank you and I hope that PERSON8 will have an answer, but I think the answer will be negative, I'm afraid. So, thanks and, yeah.",
            "Bye PERSON4.",
            "Yeah, bye bye, thank you.",
            "Sorry PERSON5, could you repeat, please?",
            "So, should I make host PERSON8 or PERSON9?",
            "It's the same.",
            "So I'll make PERSON8 the host. Thank you, bye bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "So, PERSON5 what you can do is you can just run the – run a client in debug mode and put a breakpoint and then look at all the fields that – that you get and every package that you will get back.",
            "Okay.",
            "Cause I'm not sure what is actually being transmitted and not just played by the client and what is in the packages but what is not even in the packages. Or you can run while you are running the client and look – look exactly what is in the packages.",
            "Yeah, that sounds a feasible option.",
            "Okay. Would we like to schedule a test together? Maybe next week? So that we g we can go through the possible option? And I will come back with hopefully some answer on feasibility exten en-cloud extension?",
            "Yes, I guess that should do the work, yeah.",
            "Maybe I see a question to PERSON9's idea. Are the requested outputs processed in order? That could be an interesting information. Because if perhaps for simple test PERSON9's idea will work and then for more complex one we will see. There is maybe some hash or something else that changer the order. I mean, does the order matter?",
            "No, request are imparallel.",
            "I'm not so sure, I mean, yes, they are being run imparallel, but they are not being reuested imparallel.",
            "NO, no, okay.",
            "They are requested from the server and which the server allocates the pipelines would probably be the order that I give the modal command.",
            "Yes, it's correct.",
            "Correctly. So, it could make a difference. Yeah, that's –.",
            "That's in the case we have just one ASR for English, the correct fingerprint running one instance, just one instance. It will be allocated for the first request and not for the second one. But if we have more instances running it shoud be the same.",
            "I also see problems possibly coming when you – when you're requesting fingerprints for the different – with different output types. So –.",
            "Yes, it's not –.",
            "It might be requesting different output fingerprint of the ASR, then that would be unsegmented text, where is when I want to request a fingerprint of the segmentor, that would be segmentor text. And the cient can only request outputs of one type.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "I don't think it's a restriction of the library, it's just a restriction of the client, but still.",
            "I think probaly of the client. We are working on a new clients in order to make the bug procedure a little bit more – more understandable to be, which I'm not I see, developed. And we are making it in Java, because in ORGANIZATION2 we are Java developer. And maybe –. But, well, in any case we can run two different client version – two different client instances, making ne request just one output fingerptint, which is the input fingerprint of the client.",
            "Share a pipeline.",
            "No. But at the moment I'm pretty sure that it doesn't share the – the pipeline in any case. It's well known feature request and we are still reasoning on how to extend the protocol, Because, actually, it means to work on the data structure inside the mediator to make it. But at the moment I think it doesn't – doesn't use the same instance of the ASR, both for te ASR output and machine translation.",
            "Okay, so maybe this test cannot work. But do you still have access to the – to the Swiss-code of the odl mobile technology mediator?",
            "Well, the mediator has been re-completed – re by –.",
            "Yes, I understand that, but the – the – the mobile technology mediator could do that?",
            "The other thing, so maybe – maybe look at their code and see all they did it.",
            "Thank you for this suggestion. I don't know if we have still access to it. I – I have to check it.",
            "So, yeah. I will – I will have to think about what – what I can do to run this test with a minimal – minimal breaking staff and whether ot not this test actually can produce results right now, given that we don't have the pipeline sharing and –. Actually, I can do one test –. Yeah, even if I look at – at this right now –. The test I run earlier. If I'm – if I'm reading this text correctly, I'm being allocated two separate pipelines.",
            "This is the rason why ORGANIZATION7 use the – the client pipe in order to run just one ASR. And pass its output to multiple machine translation workers. Well, it's a perfectly understandable feature request this for me. We're really investigating this possibility, however, it's not ready yet.",
            "Yeah. So I'm – I'm gonna thing about this tests more and then –.",
            "Yes. I – I will also investigate other possibilities. But definitely we need to make tests together on to understand what we really really need for – for the evalutation. So if you have at some point also description of what we are going to test, this will help us also in order to design the possible solution. PERSON5, PERSON3? Will you have at some point the description of the tests?",
            "I think PERSON5 should answer this question, because he particularly works at these taskts.",
            "I mean, yes, we should have –.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, we sh we definitely should have the description of what we're trying to run.",
            "Okay. We can make some simulation together with maybe the workers, so that we can better design this possible intermediate solution.",
            "Yeah, I mean, I really have to go to lunch now, my colleagues are – are waiting –.",
            "Well you – we have finished, don't worry –.",
            "In the document of this meeting the – the use cases that we're – that we've thinking about.",
            "Okay. So, please, PERSON5, write the use case in the document and send us also a Doodle for the next week in order to schedule the next part to hands on session and make test together in order to simulate the use case, okay?",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay. Meanwhile, I will check the library and let's see. Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",

            "Is is PERSON15 here?",
            "Zoom ei. Zoom seven is PERSON15.",
            "I I'm here. It's just.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, this is, oh my God, this is still from the last last one,. Yeah, well this is me. Yeah so, today,. So there will be call this week. Just noticed that. PERSON4 was sending an email so again,, I don't know who should be there as as mandatory attendance but again like if you want to join it's it's definitely,, possible. So about the progress. I don't know like how we moved on since last week. I think PERSON7 was still still doing the experiments, right? Can we, can we start with with the demo source?",
            "Yeah, sure. So, I'm running the experiments still because,, like it's plenty of training time. And yeah so,, currently I've finished with all those systems that are built on larger portions of monolingual or with larger portions of monolingual data. And so when larger portions of monolingual data are used,, there is no difference between those two versions,, of the. With the standard back translated and the way the back translation is done to be,, distant from the original translation from the parallel corpus. So,, I'm still waiting for the, for the experiments, or the training for the systems to be trained,, where,, I use like only one person, three person and one person of the monolingual data. So, it's still in progress,, but yeah like it's getting,, some contours. I have to discuss it with with PERSON11 also, like who, like we are both working on it. Like currently only me but yeah, he is still involved in some parts. So I have to discuss what to do next. And what are the conclusions from those experiments.",
            "Okay. Yeah, from, from my, from my side we will have consultation with PERSON14 tomorrow regarding some other stuff too. But, but hopefully I should also slowly start working on some multilingual source experiments. This month so I will also keep you updated. So, okay, next is PROJECT5, so I guess if. The question is, did the ORGANIZATION2 provided more results? I guess that's either -",
            "Yeah, so so PERSON12 I guess said, or like put into the document now like sixteen hundred or almost seventeen hundred documents, or sorry Stimuly are okay and done. And but I think it's still about the same number, isn't it?",
            "It improved a little.",
            "Okay.",
            "But I I think our,,, our procedures should be that we stat examining the data now. And just keep the experiments rolling. And just after the paper deadline we update the tables and the graphs. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so we have a discussion,, on Friday about how to deal with manual evaluation of the translation. So currently we decided that I somehow adjust the systems for the evaluation from the PROJECT4 project like,, from one one of the papers I like contributed to,, one, one and half year ago. And so, I'm now working on the hat system, or the web evaluation for or or web environment for human evaluation. And we discussed it with,, or. I announced,, ORGANIZATION6 people that they should somehow allocate the human forces and they agreed and they just. They are just waiting for us to specify,, what what the environment would look like and how what the annotation guidelines would be.",
            "Okay, so. There is also, there is also question from PERSON12, PERSON12,, like who who should be included as co-authors for the papers.",
            "We already decided who should be the co-authors. There is like eight or nine of us. It's kind of funny.",
            "Okay. Okay, so.",
            "My question was, rather, at what point should I tell others to start collaborating on the paper. Because so far it's like one and half page. So it's not like.",
            "I guess it depends on how much, how much,, contributions towards the fri writing of the paper you need from the other authors like,, you know. You can ask them, like please edit this this,, section or this paragraph or there. And they can do it. But if if that's not been required I guess, it's, you are not in in a hurry, in in this sense I guess.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, I think like,, in my view we need most of the collaboration from the ORGANIZATION2 guys.",
            "Because,,, what we need about the components that work is back like back end components, so so one of them is like QE by ORGANIZATION9. But I think that most of the, about, like most of the content about the QE system they have already explained it into the deliverable. So we can easily copy pate the deliverable and just ask them to adjust things or maybe shorten the text.",
            "So, I guess, and from our experience with ORGANIZATION2 guys, it will be it will be most problematic to get some content from them.",
            "Also I think it might be a good idea to ask them for some proof reading, since they are like native English users, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I mean, like I would expect that their contribution would be the proof reading and some description of how they got the annotators and what their profiles are.",
            "Yeah, yeah, That's that's it.",
            "And the rest is for us.",
            "And we need also. Like I I want to ask them also to to to provide us with the with the profile of the annotators because we. It's also for our statistics that we will be processing it will be interesting to know what languages they speak,, those annotators.",
            "And do they have this information? Is this in their questionnaire? Are you sure?",
            "It should be, it it's, it was in the quote prix questionnaire. So.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "Like many, many, many questions on language competence.",
            "Okay and from PERSON1 and PERSON8, are we expecting anything?",
            "I guess not, I think not, I think not not so many things. Or not like.",
            "Okay.",
            "Only. Only like how many annotators were like in the second stage of annotation, on on like I mean the human evaluation of translation. How many of them were working on it and so some basic information. I don't think they will contribute.",
            "Okay, that that's okay.",
            "We need them just to provide us with some Estonian speaking people.",
            "Yeah, yeah that's okay. So, yeah, I I just got some picture of it and I continue working. And keep you updated.",
            "Yeah, they can. For sure they can proof read the final text. But I don't think we need some like content from them.",
            "Yeah, that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I guess that leaves us with PROJECT3. PERSON10, can you give us some updates, please?",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Well,, so we this last week we, we've been working with and I've noticed that four sectors have negative constraints. So an implementation of negative constraints, so, they will open an issue asking for that. Or maybe I will start implementing. So we have been discussing these these options. And then we, we proceeded,, with the positive constraints experience. So, so far what I'm doing is, is using TF and IDF to rank tokens of references as suggested by PERSON14. And so I'm using them. So the most import. My first idea was to use the constraints. The first, the first constraint, use the single constraints with the most important code. And see what is the output. Then I had. Then I implemented the second most important,, token, second constraint and see the output. And so on. But,,, the initial results are are a bit strange. So they are. I'm I'm using a single. I'm sorry I'm having some cats around here.",
            "So,, I'm I'm noticed that it it generates different sentences and and,, noticed also that,, FairSec hasn't the implementation of the order constraints, so I had to change it to order it so. And it,, but I was just discussing with PERSON15, that,, this is quite trivial. That it's trivial to conclude that that if I add many constraints I will have,, the output similar to the reference only by the the this this token. So I don't. We are, we are discussing,, different approaches to the different experiments that will be a better contribution to the,, to this task.",
            "So,, so PERSON15 gave the idea of, of trying to generate paraphrases right PERSON15, is it correct?",
            "Well, sort of, right. Well, currently the paraphrases are based on,, it's like that we have multiple referential sentences so we want to try it with that right?",
            "Yeah, so,, every every time I add,, one one constraint I I have. So this is, this is one point that we need to discuss yet. But every time I add a constraint, it generates in our, a a kind of a paraphrase from from the reference I want and in the end it is not the reference I want neither the the the main the main target,, sentence.",
            "This is something to discuss and actually I'm having some some difficulties on on that. Although PERSON15 is is doing his best to help me on that.",
            "But, but I still don't have,, let me check, I still don't have the results for, for this first experiment but,, I will try to to have it,, as soon as possible so we can discuss. But it's as I as I said the blue scores will improve as we as we add constraints to the to the sentence, to the English sentence, right?",
            "Okay, so, so you're still just trying a single constraint. Thee, like in the experiments run right. Or or are you increasing the number of constraints, like?",
            "I'm increasing the number of constraints.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And when you increase the number of tokens inevitably the blue score is getting better, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, okay, so that's, that's.",
            "I still have to do more experiments about using this. But,, the sy. I'm using only one reference now and adding tokens about that and and checking the blue score. But I have to do it for many of them. But,, it seem like you repeat for every every sentence I use, so.",
            "Okay.",
            "Well, I will keep that and I have to check this negative constraints issue.",
            "And see how to amend that and and try to think about new ideas or yeah, different.",
            "So thank you for the good progress. So one comment is on the negative constraints. You said that they are not in FairSeq and that you are considering adding them there. It will be definitely much better to switch to PROJECT1 with everything. Because it is actually one other thing that we were asked to,, do at the review, if I'm not mistaken. So the reviewers preferred that all the experiments are done in, like finally, and especially for the purposes of integration,,, they have to be done in in PROJECT1. So if the FairSeq is good for the positive constraints do the experiments there. But if you already need to implement anything. Rather move to PROJECT1 and do the implementation,, of the other missing,, of the missing part,, in in PROJECT1 even if it is the other,, thing. For the evaluation that's,, if I understand correctly, that's that's really a big problem that. Like it it didn't fully occur to me,, when I was suggesting the multiple reference data-sets. But as soon as you ask for some word, even if it's from the other references, right, the bleu score increases.",
            "Yeah. Actually maybe, maybe, what I'm doing is taking a reference, one of the references and using the tokens for from that preference to as a constraint trying to have this output. But it will happen happen eventually, because as I add the constraints we will have this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or a similar one, right.",
            "Yeah, so the so,, it definitely if you are asking for the same reference, if you are evaluating your modified,, output against the same reference. Yes, then, in a way you are like cheating in a way, because you are telling the system what it will score on. But, for that I was hoping that for that you could actually use the multiple reference data sets. And then you would be evaluating on the other references. And you st. And there is,, the big risk that you will be getting this always guaranteed increase of the bleu score. So is that, is that a case? Are you already getting this on the other sentences?",
            "No, no not on the other sentences but when you, when you say that you you think I will compare the sentence that has the same constraint but is a different sentence. I mean, because.",
            "Yeah, so if you have multiple references. You have like one, one candidate and then you have four references. And then this candidate was created by taking constraints from the first reference so let's take this,, so one out and let's evaluate those three references only. So we evaluate the baseline system and the system, which,, has this extra constraint from the first one. The reason is to re-evaluate that obviously the bleu scores are only comparable only if you have the fixed set of sentences. So, you have to limit yourself to those three sentences,, in the reference only. Now the point that you are bringing up, is whether this word, that we demand that we asked for, actually does appear in these,, references or not. If it does appear there, then yes, you are going to gain. But if it doesn't appear there, you still may get other,, imp, improvements. And and also if does appear there, is no longer cheating,, because,, you, didn't know,, what the other reference said. You only like had an external knowledge of the world, like what is what is expected there. So, if if the if you see the bleu scores on these three extra sentences,, yes, we have to warn, but it's no longer cheating. So we will see how,, how big the gains are. But ultimately I fully agree,, we have to do a manual evaluation. And see like how many constraints are needed to see some significant improvement in manual scores,.",
            "Okay, yeah. So, yeah, I'll think about it.",
            "It is a bit problematic, it is problematic. If someone can come up with a,, with yet another twist to evaluate these constraints that would be better,, but,, at least this is not like flout.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. It's better. Okay,, I'll I'll test that. Because now I'm I'm I'm understanding something that is trivial for for you but the idea that if I'm if I'm comparing to these three references I'm I'm making sure that it has some,, the sense I we want, right, the meaning we want. So, I okay, it's it's fine.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm not comparing to the to the to the ones the one I'm taking the the constraints, perfect. And one the ideas was to stress the constraints so. Actually to use too many constraints to see what happens, but from different parts of it and and see. But maybe this is. We should have to think better about this actually.",
            "But perfect, I'll implement this and and I'll.",
            "Yeah, it's just a different type of evaluation. It's not a new model, it's only new evaluation.",
            "Yeah. You told at the previous internal.",
            "Yeah, that's okay. That's normal.",
            "The previous meeting and I I forgot to implement that. Okay. Thank you.",
            "Yeah. Oh so, you are already practicing for,, for the,, for the arrival to LOCATION1. That's great.",
            "Just the, just the first words of of Duolingo.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "So just, the technical part. Just to be sure. In PROJECT1 there was some implementation of constraints decoding, right? Or wasn't? Like I.",
            "Well. Yeah, there is,.",
            "Like you can. It's very simple implementation, you can supply,, something like,, phrase table from Moses or something like that. And then,, it's not ordered anyhow or it's just. If you have these words from the source side or phrases at the source side,, then only the words that,, are possible in the phrase table on the target parts can be generated. Like the the Softmax is masked,, so that no other tokens can be generated, but that's it. That's all.",
            "Okay, so so it's a little bit different from what is recorded in the in the related from the paper from,, NetPost, was it NetPost?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's it's different. This is just globally. It's. It just masks the Softmax to not generate something that doesn't appear in the phrase table on the target sides.",
            "Okay.",
            "And in the same that, because like now, in the in that data augmentation experiment we work with, data generated by like a branch of PROJECT1. By PERSON3 and yeah, he also implemented only the negative constraints.",
            "But he told us that it's exactly the implementation like. It just copies the implementation of NetPosts.",
            "With the only difference that they didn't implement positive,, constraints.",
            "Okay, I didn't see that. But in the main branch it's only just a work list. But yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, okay. This is Niko, this is not in.",
            "Yeah, sure,",
            "This is not in the main branch, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I didn't see that.",
            "So, please let me ask again about the positive constraints. The the contribution that PERSON13 has there. Or PERSON13,, the,, the question is. You you've mentioned that it's like a source and target. So,, what is not clear to me is when the source is being checked. And when is the target being required. Because,, if you are producing the output left to right,, essentially the attention can look anywhere.",
            "No. So, it's like global for all the sentences. It doesn't matter where the attention looks. It's.",
            "They look for all the possible occurrences of the phrases at the source side, at the phrase table. And then, they find all the possible tokens at the target side of the phrase table. And then they mask everything else out in the Softmax.",
            "Which is which is problematic, because,, that means that your positive, list, actually has to mention all the possible formulations.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. They they don't expect any like gains from that. That's ju, mainly because for the speed up on CPU's. So that they don't have to compute every probability in the Softmax but only a small sub-set of them. So it's not, it's not expected to improve the translation. It's just just for the speed up on the CPU's.",
            "So if we want to use this truly as a positive constraint for our purposes,, like we want to ensure the target sentence will contain this term. This is hard.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I don't think. I. At first I thought I can just,, modify this implementation. But now I think I will have to look at the look at other branch or start from scratch.",
            "Yeah. But still it will be conceptually, probably.",
            "Yeah, when I. Two weeks ago or three weeks ago or like a month, I can't remember. I communicated with PERSON3 and he promised us to help us with this. At least to point us to the implementation that he did, where he implemented the negative constraints. So we don't have to implement it from the scratch.",
            "Okay, I'll I'll send him an email or something and I'll talk with him.",
            "So if you are. If if now you are in the point starting with the implementation of the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I had a look at the. I wanted to implement it the same way or very similarly to FairSeq. I had a look at FairSeq code. But yeah, I will ask him and I will see. What he's got.",
            "Yeah. I just wanted to.",
            "The negative constraints are easy.",
            "I just wanted to, I just wanted to remind that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So the negative constraints, please locate the code by PERSON3. That's better.",
            "Hopefully that will work out of the box.",
            "Sure.",
            "And there will be no need to,,, implement negative constraints. But for the positive constrains, I agree with PERSON13. That this really has to be done,, starting from scratch and even.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe,, it first first has to be re-designed. We we have to know how to achieve that. Because it's like,, difficult to require the decoder to produce something when you do not know how many words is the decoder still going to produce.",
            "So maybe we could still think of a way of using the current implementation. So like. Two people should think about this. PERSON13, about the proper handling, if there is any. Like how to make sure that before the sentence finishes,, the,, some of the words was used. That can be achieved by filtering, at, at, the furthering of the or something like that. Which is poor man solution. We could try it. But at the same time I think that PERSON10 can starting thinking about the way how to use the current implementation and, filter this like phrase table, so,, that it,,,, release to this forced style of translation. It would not be applicable to all the words, but it could be applicable to content. So,, if we know. So, imagine that we have the phrase table created on a very lar, from a very large corpus, where obviously content word have many different translations and there is also noise, like non content words,,, linked with them. We extract just one to one phrase table,, which,,, like, says,, that whatever Praha is translated to Prague or Pragl, and,, because there will be also some Brno, Brno dialect there. And we want to ensure that the Pragl is is used there,, then,, we could run the positive constraints as it is implemented now, with this phrase table filtered so that, no Praha appears there, and only Pragl does. And that way,, the,, like taking the universum and separating the things we don't want, we can actually,, ensure that,, that the positive implication its done there. It's heavy, I kn, I I agree. But if if if the, if the the universum itself comes as an as a speed up for the Softmax, then maybe we could, we could achieve that. Obviously, this will be further complicated by the sub-word units. So,, like,, there is still a risk that it will still create Praha from the sub words,, despite the fact that we have removed the option to produce Praha as a single unit. But we could at least explore this. So I think that two people can simultaneously look at two different ways of how to achieve the positive constraints.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Just, just let me step in. I think like everything,,, I think like the the the way how it it can be achieved is explained in the NetPost paper and it has been already implemented in the Sokai. Both the positive and negative constraints in the same place, so we don't need to re, reinvent the wheel, but.",
            "Okay. So what is.",
            "So maybe I'm I'm. I didn't understand.",
            "Yeah, well, I haven't read the paper. It could be there. I'm I'm reinventing the wheel because I haven't read it. So what is. How do they. So how is that different from,, how how do they do it. Yeah, that's.",
            "I I don't know the details I I read it but I already forgot it. But it's,, I reme, like I remember there is a nice figure how to, how decoding works. With both positive and negative constraints, and they also think about,, that, the words that are there like,, there are like words pieces not the words.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, yeah.",
            "We can try that, yeah.",
            "But PERSON13 has read this paper, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "When PERSON13 said that they do it only for the purposes of of like,, pr.",
            "No, no, no, that's that's.",
            "No, no, no.",
            "No, no, no,, that's. I was talking about the PROJECT1 implementation. What's implemented in PROJECT1 right now.",
            "Okay, okay, yeah.",
            "In the main branch.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's something different, yeah. Well, yeah, that that approach from the paper is. Well we'd have to implement the approach from the paper from the scratch in PROJECT1. I don't know about,, PERSON3 branch. I don't know about that. I that's something similar, okay, then. But, right now, yeah. Paper can be. It's very similar to FairSeq approach or the FairSeq code is just an improvement over the paper. And it also has the paper itself. But yeah, the,, the original implementation is in Sokai and I also looked at it and yeah, I think we can re-implement that in PROJECT1. But.",
            "Okay, so, my my idea of two people looking at this is true. But the assignments are slightly different. PERSON10 can,, look into like the simpler approach, like what is in PROJECT1 in in PERSON13's branch already.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And PERSON13 will look at the paper by NetPost and also the existing implementations which are.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Everywhere else except PROJECT1. And PERSON13 will re-implement this in PROJECT1. To have the positive constraints there on top of the code by PERSON3, which already are negative constraints, right?",
            "Right. Well, I will see the PERSON3's code if that's the same. It's,, the code from the paper or something else.",
            "Yeah, great.",
            "Sorry, I I just. My Zoom crashed for a while, so it. Could you repeat the conclusion of it?",
            "Yeah, the conclusion is still two people can look at it. And it makes sense. The first person would be PERSON10,, who should,,, try thinking about this crazy,, set up,, that I described. Like, reusing PERSON13's code. Which is like the positive constraints,,, but it's positive but you have to list that whole universum,, in addition to that. And,, PERSON13 will look at the code by PERSON3 and,, like start from. Which which already contains the negative constraints and start from that in prder to add the positive constraints as they are described in the,,, NetPost paper and implemented in FairSeq and PROJECT1. Sorry, in FairSeq and ORGANIZATION1 to to get it into PROJECT1.",
            "And maybe just last remark. Don't forget on the Sokai implementation because both, the positive and negative constraints have been implemented.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'll already, I already looked at Sokai. Also about the, about the evaluation of the constraints. I did an experiment, about two years ago. Something similar, when we tried to integrate the translation memories with the translation. With an MT and we added larger like probability. It was very simple implementation, only increased probability of. Like we had a translation memory which was in Lucene. So, when you had a source sentence, there was some TF IDF like scoring and the most similar sentences in the memory were retrieved. And we had,, work alignments, so we knew, also in the database, so we knew which parts of the source sentence are the the same as in the in the. Like we knew which part of the source sentences are,, present in the translation memory. And we knew which part on the target in translation memory corresponds to the to these parts of the source sentence. So we only added some bonus probability in the Soft Max to these tokens, in translating. And yeah, we. The way we evaluated is that we had domain specific databases and test sets. And,, we just computed the blue score, blue scores there. And it seemed to help, when the domain was really close, even with the WMT test sets. We used I think the news commentary or something like that. And also we improved the blue scores a little bit. So maybe the evaluation can be done in this way. Like,, to have some translation memory or database with very similar sentences and retrieve them automatically and not to use the references as,, as the source for the,, for the constraints. But to retrieve the constraints, from some, something similar.",
            "The problem is that we don't have any translation memory ourselves.",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "We could, well. We could create it obviously from parallel corpora. So, but we don't have it labelled for domains. And that's the benefit that you probably had.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was about domain.",
            "We are slowly working to, towards like domain specific test sets in,, PROJECT4. Because there we have the auditing domain and other domains as well. So that could be in principal used, but it's very small at the moment. We could create the,, like domain specific translation memories from the training data there. So that could. If we moved to to that situation, yes we we would have some data at hand from sister project. So that makes sense. So please, le, let's keep this in mind. And I wanted to say,, one more thing. And that is, yes, from PROJECT4,,, I have,,, I have one or two people who are also looking at evaluation of domain specific,, systems. And the goal there is to improve the translation of like domain specific terms. So,, we are not that interested in in bleu score increase overall. Because we believe that the rest of the sentences will remain like incomparably similar. But., we are looking at some like lexical checks for very small number of words and,, we would like to see some improvements for these word specific. So that would be,, like further extension of the evaluation that you did,,, in the past for ORGANIZATION3. We want to do something like that in PROJECT4. So that may be a secondary evaluation, that would arrive from from there. The the people there are PERSON6 and PERSON9. I am just telling that so that we, we have the links,, to,, to them. So if they come up.",
            "I also think -",
            "Evaluation of key words we should apply it here as well.",
            "If I remember correctly, I think I also did some tests on some PROJECT data. So maybe that's like a domain specific corpus, corpora and test set?",
            "Yes, yea, yes.",
            "And I think maybe.",
            "That's definitely.",
            "I think that kind of worked there also. Little bit.",
            "Yeah, so that's, that's it. So maybe I'll put you in touch,, with,,, PERSON6 and,, PERSON9 so that you. Probably you can't, you can no longer access those,, old experiments by ORGANIZATION3. But, you could redo them,, with the resources that we have here.",
            "Well, I think I can find them somewhere. It's. I can have a look.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's like three years ago, but I think.",
            "Yeah, if, if, if, yeah, it would be great. So if PERSON9 comes up with some evaluation measure,, then,, it would be great if you could test it on your existing data if it shows,,, a bigger improvement than, than a medium improvement.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Because it would focus on these specific terms.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That would be great, thanks.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I, yeah. So this is all, I guess, right? Or is there anything else we need to discuss? Okay, just a just a quick question PERSON10 how is how is the visa process going, is it is it moving well?",
            "Yeah, it's okay. I've bought the tickets for LOCATION2, to go to LOCATION2. And and there I will make the visa, it will be in November. And as soon as I have the visa, I can go.",
            "Okay. So, again, I'm reminding you just keep all the travel receipts and maybe we will see like what are the options. Like anyway, right? Okay, that I think that's that's it. Maybe maybe PERSON10 can can you please add the part PERSON14 asked you to to do. Because I missed it. So just add it to the ORGANIZATION8 Doc, please. And yeah, I think that's that's all and see you see you next week. Or, oh, one one thing I forgot. Like there is ORGANIZATION7 beer from six PM today and everyone is invited. And I know PERSON10 that you will technically still be working but you can you can definitely. Or PERSON14 I think i think that is is possible that he can take a break sooner and and join in too. I think we should.",
            "Sure, and I'm sure he will be more productive after a couple of beers that he will drink on his own connected -.",
            "Yeah, so he will have an open chance to to meet other people from our department and yeah we are starting at six so which is in eighty eight minutes and hopefully it will take at least one or two hours.",
            "Yeah. I'm I'm not joining this time unfortunately but. Will you do, singing again?",
            "Signing or singing?",
            "Singing singing singing not signing?",
            "I don't know if there was singing on the last Zoom.",
            "Sometimes if if it's in person then there is often singing but.",
            "We will see based on attendance.",
            "Yes, the only, the only singing was when all all of our group were in in a flat. And you were just online.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So, it was possible to sing and for you just to listen. But I can't imagine doing it via Zoom. Everybody is.",
            "Well, it can be done I guess but.",
            "It can be done, yeah.",
            "Okay, so technically, like yeah, that's it. This is it for this week and see you on the ORGANIZATION7 beer right yes. Okay, so thanks.",
            "Yeah. Bye, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",

            "Yeah so can you hear me now?",
            "Yes, sure, do you hear me?",
            "Yeah, okay, yes, great.",
            "Oh, great.",
            "Amazing. If I understood correctly, is not going to join.",
            "Okay.",
            "If he would come but he and he said yes, but then he disappeared. So I do not know.",
            "Okay. Well today should be pretty simple, simple, simple meeting. Actually, we, we have collected all the feedbacks received doing the,, well at the June events in LOCATION1, and during the tests, and the event sitting Autumn the correct one faculty remember. And so we have collected all of them, and we are going to reveal presentation platform. The goal is to have the new, for the congress in the end of May. Since actually, we are going to review the look and feel of the web. We would like to have the European union, and the expecially your agreement since you are the project leader, and we would like to,, prepare somthing that acomplish the PROJECT1 requirements. I'm going to share the presentation,",
            "Mm-hmm,. So will connect soon, hes, hes here in the,, i cannot switch off, like I'm already using the mic and I Theres no way to put it through out speakers im afraid.",
            "Okay, meanwhile I drag end up on my presentation,. Sorry, I'm going to copy, since we share share point maybe it is making some problem. I copied on the. Okay. So until when do we need to call like, how long would would twelve 50 be sufficient to end?",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I'm not able to presentation. I do not know why?",
            "Sharing the screen, can you try sharing the screen? Guest, oh okay. Make host. I do not know to be able to prison to scream.",
            "Sorry, just a sec. Okay. Do you see presentation now?.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Now lets see if I'm able to move through these lights, okay. Okay, are we ready?",
            "Thank you, we noticed, this is a good summary.",
            "Its the presentation platform. Okay. I select the of boxes subtittles appears. Could you commute? So you can you mute when you have some interview. Thank you can see things. OK. Expecially you PERSON5 to let me be the user, and the find de is the subtitle of size and lenght. And if you remember, we encountered the problem of having three lines of subtitles. And the third line disappeared, in,, beneath the the box, because there is not that an enough space nor space. And we often talked about the possibility of having a longer the context, especially, that you liked the the history that see presentation so that the user is able to scroll, the history and read the past messages,, from the. Often people prefer to enable just one language for subtittle, most of the time, the the the language is the English or their mother tongue, and then just a couple of notes that he liked the black and white subtitles and also, the size was fine,, reading the questionnaire. From the old tomb events,, we weders as feedback the possibility to disable the video, because sometimes is not available at all. Your colleagues asked us to have the possibility to automatically load, a list of,, default, lets say languages, for example like that, that each time, the user enter the main page, seeing the, for example, the at least English subtitle enabled by default, we talk about the the, to make the subtitles base adaptive in order to hostile all the text. The then we the left justified the subtitles. This is pretty strange and for us because the subtitles usually appear centered,, but we understood that the requirements was related to the incremental, especially for the machine translation, with the change of all the while assets a new up from the ESR are, and it changed too much and its confusing for the user, and expecially during the event. If I correctly remember, you see the the application. And and you like the really not should.",
            "Have you seen our paragraph, style view? I think you must have seen it. In the in the paper. So I think that the paragraphs style view is kind of done by that, so I think that there is no need to, to force it into your interface, but we do not have the video. So thats, so thats, the question, whether people want the video plus the paragraph view. And that is something which we do not have.",
            "Mm-hmm, okay. Okay. Well reason about these requirements and reason about how to change the actual presentation platform in order to try to accomplish as much as possible on the requirements, but actually there are some unco incompability. And because we need to because if you like to have,, the video as much should be good as possible. Probably, we have to sacrifie all the history style view, or the possibility to have a subtitles in many languages at the same time. And this is true for all the,,, lets say the three main requirements, if you would like to have the history. We cannot have many. So actually present you 3D let see of the new presentational platform that are only images has been done yet,, but its, Please consider them as possible,, starting point for the next,,, developments. Okay. The first is the history style. Pro, we have the video as bigger as possible. Here told me also to be really careful expecially, because he at the moment on the market that we have both,,, left 16 to 9 representation. And with 4 to 3 representation. We have to reason really careful on the representation, but actually,,, this configuration could change, based on the screen size.",
            "I like this layout.",
            "Oh okay. But actually, if we maximize the video size. We can have the history on the left, actually its like the ORGANIZATION5 application, but for sure it does not enable you to have many languages first time and these are, cant select just one language per time, and probably,, we have to manage the incremental in some way, We are still on the idea to, to not put business logic inside the presentation. It is just a presentation layer. The business logic should be the prepared by the module before the presenation base. So that if you would like to have this kind of representation, we need to manage the incremental updates of the ORGANIZATION4 ASR before they arrive to the presentation layer. We have also some doubts regarding the mobile friendly representation. I'm, I'm not sure, but the PROJECT1 grand agreement it is written that people will use the presentation platform, on the person of the. I'm gonna first read these definition I talked about the also mobile phones or tablests as. Actually we seen people just use a lot of the Please tell me if the mobile friendliness is a requirement for you or not.",
            "It is. It is hard to say, it was nice feature in your view. But I I think it is likely that the ORGANIZATION2 people would use it. Because this is. Its very hard to say. PERSON4, sorry to interrupt you. I will make two phone calls, and I will be back in five minutes.",
            "I promise, that in a quarter we will finish everything. So I would like to make a phonecalls and there just ending now, so, so ill, ill have more time.",
            "Ok, and we can do not worry thank you.",
            "So i will be back in one second.",
            "Do you have opinion regarding this representation?",
            "Actual presentation platform boxes. Have you seen me? Have you heard me?",
            "Hi.",
            "Presentation platform feature in different places inside our webpage, of course our designer will will provide,, better ideas, it will not be,, bold white text. On black screen. It will look much more like the chat Have you seen the ORGANIZATION5 application? Okay, it will probably look,,, roughly like this one. This one will be the, the design choosen by PERSON5 of course. Because, this is just a proposal. The first one. We are going to see other two different proposal, in orded to review the presentation platform application.",
            "Your microphone its really really powerful, it catch a lot of, of different noises. Can you repeat it please?",
            "I think that the presentation platform we already have a, a white label on the black boxes, in order to, define whitch subtitle language is displayed in the box. My idea but its really just a picture on, on a slide for the moment. In this kind of representation is to have for languages for example. In this example you see theres the EN tab. But if someone would like to see the German one, can select the different tab. Hi PERSON5, you are back.",
            "Okay, I'm back. Yeah. So, I do not know what you have discussed. But as I said, I like this view. And in addition to the top idea I can. I could see an option to have the languag two languages but not more, underneath each other so there could be like upper half for English and lower half for another language,",
            "Lets say if I select the one or two or three or four opinion creates too much. It is not that user friendly. Just one language, and if someone would like to see, for example, to switch to German subtitles select. For example, of course, this is just my picture, but I can take another, and then we discuss it, the,, developer. We already talked about this possibility, and they were not,,",
            "So the tabs are okay, or.",
            "The text is just the first simple really simple idea,",
            "Let us stick to the that. I think it makes sense. And I agree that having like two languages at the same time would be or already complication. I can easily easily find situations where it would be useful to have more languages in, like underneath each other, but we cannot for all the the situation. So it is.",
            "The second proposal is the following, which is the actual. Let us see the representation. Here the video size. He read these reviews that in order to have everything in the same screen now, and the idea would be to add the history in the black box for subtitles in order to let them become scrollable, and this will be also, more mobile friendly in our opinion. But of course it looks a little bit and all the style of representation.",
            "I don't mind the I do not mind the old style. But what I'm afraid of is the is the space. So now you, you are showing three lines. I think it is its like the worst compromise, the because you do not get enough content of not enough of the paragraph view, and the font is already too small, so it is not the subtitles, which are easy to read. So I think thats, thats the I would not go for this one. So I I like the way the that you know, the the current view, which has big fonts, but has serious problem was with the flicker. But that is if if the if the language allows that, then it is okay. But I like also your proposal with the tabs where theres the paragraph next to the video that looks the very good. But this is one. And even if you have two languages as you are showing it now. I think in the it is like the something, which does not have any any benefit of either of the solutions.",
            "Actually one of the benefits is that, so you can have more languages per time. You can also disable the video. Instead in the history representation. I have not been to the picture for this scenario, sorry. But the idea is that the big picture of the work that. Its just a black. Without the video, which is not that, its not that attractive. Exactly. But of course, we have to take some decision.",
            "So i think that there is no There is no need to prepare this style of view the video, because for that, the the the the presentation that all the created is sufficient.",
            "Okay. Okay. And this is, okay. And these, of the video and our last propose is the following. And and especially our designers pressed a lot these kind of representation, The at the beginning of the project, they proposed the first this kind of representation. And we said, \"no, because we need to be able to read the text on the slide. And we said that having the subtitle overlay to the vindeo, video on stream. Can cover some text inside these lights. This is probably the most attractive one, because, the kind of YouTube style representation of subtitles. And it is for sure mobile friendly, but in this representation, you can not disable, the video, for example, on the other side you can make it as bigger as possible, because you can have the video fullscreen, and still be able to subtitles. This situation again, one language per time.",
            "Yeah, so I like the set up as well. So I think we are actually the the there is different situations, but we are coming towards three different views, and I think we should have all of them. So this one, which was no, another will have previously as the something which which like. So I would really like this one to be implemented. Then there is the number of changes which we need to in in your existing subtitle view. But these changes are not to the event, but they need not be too big.",
            "Well I actually The only,, the only the only representation, which does not require big changes is the second. But don't worry we have. It was the first presentation platform is the first demo in order to be able to check integration make some experiments. We are not afraid to move to a different representation pictured by us. More work do not worry. We used to like the third one, expecially because it can be declined in other voice applications. But, we, we have like was so to have the least try the history style in ORGANIZATION5 history style, the first one. And at least to try. What do you think that in the Russia ORGANIZATION2 would be,, the preferable, preferable representation in your opinion?",
            "Yeah, so, I know that there will be people just,, roaming around, and these will have small devices. So for them anything, which is like, and they will be also, they will be sometimes in the room. But even if they are in the room then they cannot really follow the subtitles on their cell phone and the slides in front of them. So they still need need to have the slides on the on the device. The so called then this you. The one that we are looking at now is that as they will select one language, probably English, or their mother de depending on what it is easier for them to follow, and they will. They will follow this. Then there will be some big screen outside of the the main presentation of the main conference room. And that presentations green should the in my opinion attract everybody in all their many languages, like the content of the, of the discussions, which is,, which is running in the in the hole. So it is like, there is this main conference happening. And there is off stage corridor were people gather, and they are not sure if they want to enter the hall or not. So they follow the, the monitor and the subtitles there. And for that view, I think that is the So originally, I thought that we would have there only the man is. So it is it is important, show many languages. But it is also important to show the video, and we have slightly bigger screen the size of the screen, and also that its location is very unclear. Lately, it is like last week, as he said, this can be negotiated.",
            "Maybe I, I understood your your point. Maybe we can try to have the history style, with at most two languages. What do you think?",
            "Which would be English and the and the floor, or something like that, right? But then we would need to edit that actively. And to decide which of the languages should be shown. So This is, this is hard decision. And its like, it could it induce lot of work, and then end up being hidden somewhere like the back of the corridor that no one ever sees it. So the so that could be effot to some extent. So what we could also do there is, to only show the video, and kind of just place another window next that, and use the existing paragraph view with that, or use the existing subtitle view with that. So we would like put this, organize this together only for that, for that simple screen. So I cannot imagine that we would have one person, taking care of this of the this screen. I think this screen has to be set up and and run all the time without any manual intervention. Theres no We do not have the capacity, we will not have the capacity at the ORGANIZATION2 to, to run it. To have someone who would be like switching languages, and and so on. So I see two options what the show on the screen, one would be English subtitles, regardless the language, which is spoken. And the the most of the area to be used for the, for video or all the languages that we are supporting as an advertisement, and then the or people can select their own language, and the video would be very useful there, but i don't know if we have to develop it as an application, I would just organize the windows on.",
            "Moreover, I think that for the advertising,, view lets say, its more interesting to see,, many languages, and also maybe a small, small video. You can put them on the top of the actual application, ditch the HLS streaming, and even if its small, it is just for, lets say an informative reason.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "The focus would be on subtitles.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Ok. So Just to recover, this is Okay this is the prone and control of, of all the three possible,, representation. You like most the third one if I currently understood? Okay. Would you like we try the paragraph for the first one, the ORGANIZATION5 style history? Because otherwise we are removing completely the history requirements which could be fine of course. Just to be sure that these this is a decision,.",
            "It is difficult, I understand.",
            "I think that for,, the paragraph, with the depths is sufficiently mobile friendly.",
            "Actually.",
            "The ORGANIZATION5, the history style of ORGANIZATION5?",
            "Unfortunately, I havent the picture of a mobile here. Later my mobile telephone here, but actually usually people see, exactly, look at the telephone in vertical, having the history here in makes text really small and the history goes really fast. But we can try. I'm not, an definetly not a web designer.",
            "I'magine if they headed veritcally oriented. And it would be like video in the upper half or less actually. Then you would have obviously one language only, but you could have quite long,, history.",
            "I can propose it. I'm not sure, I cannot promise it. But I understand your idea, is to have the video here and the history here. I can propose it. Would you like the ORGANIZATION5.",
            "For the horizontal layout,, I think that is better fit for the last. The subtitle was setup where we have the small history, and it may prove to flickering. So this is something which, where you pay for the, you by the small video. But you have gained lot of lot of history here.",
            "Mm-hmm, okay.",
            "Like scroll the history. Where is here you can observe is that does not make sense to scroll the overlay as a subtitle, that would be okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "And underneath we have a paragraph view, kind of the thing. To be wasting that the space for the decks. I would somehow have, I do not know, maybe just have like one setting button here that which, that would allow you to to the language instead of the deck.",
            "Okay. I'm going to send you the update of the finantial requirements, but just to be sure for the ASR ORGANIZATION2 in which represent We are going to prepare both the lets say, history ORGANIZATION5 style and the subtitle overlay. But the most important, for the ORGANIZATION2 will be.",
            "I think the subtitle overlay, thats my guess, it would for people roaming in the corridors, and, and like remotely watching what is happening.",
            "Okay.",
            "The other mode, which is the main screen,, somewhere like no not the the very main screen, but the,, the screen in the, in the lobby. For that we would use your existing implementation, and sh Either your existing information with no video whatsoever, or the the the player to the paragraph view that we have somehow. I don't know how to make a float, that works or not. That is easy reasonably easy to add a floating slowly video player like the vision.",
            "I cannot say sorry. I'm not I do not have the technical,, understanding beneath the web things, sorry.",
            "I think the I think it should be organizable simply by like putting windows on on various models. So it could be just the standard window manager. And and two windows, one with the full screen web browser, and on top of that a video player, which runs the, and that would probably do the job.",
            "Okay. I'm going to send you the review of the requirements. In order to be sure that I understood everything. And I hope we will start to with the development soon, because and we need to test, test everything.",
            "So I was I was also curious about the current interface. I am going to like throw that out, throw it away, or right start from scratch, or are you going to, to improve the existing one?",
            "I don't know. It depends from the developer, sorry.",
            "You mentioned, you mention some time ago that this was in Ruby, and you do not have anyone who work on ruby code anymore, or something like that. But I do not know.",
            "No, no you, of course we have a really developer. I'm not gonna developer. You. Niether the, the developer.",
            "So there, because my my question for And that actually also,,,,, is related to the, the subtitle overlay. The the last setup. The the question is what is in the messages, and I think that the and I said this quite early in the communication. I think that the messages should be sentence oriented, as they are now coming to, into the like, subtitle. If you remember I'm subtitler, which was organizing sentences into these like the in the the two lines. But the way I created the subtitler, was that it was flexible, and did you manage to I think I e-mailed you the link to and there was like little demo. And when you played the subtitler and you changed the size of the window. It like cleverly filled that space, and it was rolling smoothly, and when you reuse the space. It was rolling smooth, if it could and then it had resets. Do you remember it? The idea Yeah. So this is this is like, text flow functionallity kind of. So its deciding which to, which text to put where as the messages are coming in. And it is what you are doing is that flowed the decisions like when the brake lines. You need to know how much of the text that fit there, and how much did not. And so that is why I was from saying that I think this text flow functionally should be part of the the final view. And if people change their phone size. The the final application. Should they did, and you fold size into account and should food or was that should fit, but the logic that does the text flow has to know the font size.",
            "Sorry, send me your present.",
            "Yeah, so my question is if you can include in your plans to have this subtitling functionally in the in the front-end in the final the player, which no the font size.",
            "I understood your points. Actually we, we would probably have noted that we have not talked about the possibility to let the user, define the look and feel of the subtitles. For the moment I will It will not be available. And the reason is that these on. To the the the the, like the decisions by the user, but is also a responding to the actual space on the on the screen on the.",
            "Exactly, exactly. Managed but onto the French things. One thing is that the user can customize, for example, the phone size, of the subtitle. He now meaning these on our experience. The the user is not able to understand what is readable subtitle. And this is the reason why we do not put these kind of functionality, at least for the moment in the pressentation,.",
            "Use this control plus, and minus. I very often change the font size for the word pages, because the different web page designers where, will simply their preferences were incompatible with those of mine, and I like cannot read it. So if you, if you if you want to really, do it you for your safety. Then you would have the to disable this paling. You would have the work on on making the font size fixed and unchangeable. But I make it bad for the user.",
            "A different aspects of this, this topic, is be able to have the wall subtitle in my window. So that having avoiding that the subtitles disappeared under the screen and so on. Like actually working like, right now. If you make three subtitles lines, the third one is pretty unreadable. These will be fixed instead.",
            "But how? What is your.",
            "First of all tying to define standard. For example, subtitles should not be longer than this and ask you, and all the partners to avoid, to send the longer messages. Of course, when you. Yes. This is the reason why experience of course, we need a kind of offering which prepairs the subtitles before - I know that it is definitely something that you do not like it. And we have disabled in, in each places where it where, don't worry. But based on our experience, really thus PROJECT1 of something each prepares the subtitles before the view. Maybe reasoning on punctuation and reasoning on max words to be displayed on the screen. And this is definitely disabled for the PROJECT1 project but is something that project, because this helps us to make the subtitle more readable.",
            "Because I think that the logic behind this is very complicated, like the the. If you are making subtitles for movie. Then, they are offline like, you know, what should appear where. You, you have the time to fix it. And I'm sure that the there is someone who was checking the professionally prepared subtitles and fixing them like.",
            "Real time actually,, most of the time seen with the human,,, supervision.",
            "You have You have live human supervision.",
            "Yes. It is the PSWV application. Remember, I can show you really nice demo of this kind of, of application, but usually the human supervision, is focused on fixing words autography and fixing ASR possible errors. And also on the look and feel of the subtitles. Look and feel of the subtitles is based on general rule. We know, for example, that subtitle's should not be longer than forty two characters. Usually its two line separated. Usually we prefer to have,, a complete phrase, in one subtitle screen, and those are all possible rules that can be applied in order to prepare readable subtitles.",
            "Then you have to have a delay for that, because the has to be completed. So,, yeah. Thats, if, if we are to introduce the delay of then I understand it is you can do all this clever logic.",
            "Actually, it, it introduce delay expecialy introduce it in, when the machine translation is. But usually people prefer to prepare subtitles for deaf people. And then deaf people are not that affected from, from these kinds of, delay. I can understand that for. Different.",
            "So if they already like have no way of getting the information. They are happy to wait three seconds and have it after three seconds. They do not realize that there is any delay.",
            "Yes,. When we prepare,, subtitles for lets say in offline solution. Instead we also check, for example,, screen changes, and we synchronize subtitles with screen changes in dismiss, the subtitles,, lets say synchronize with the history. The program. Okay. Actually we have finished. I'm going to review everything and send you, the. I can wrote it also in the google,, and I will maybe when we have something,,,, something to be displayed, something correct. Little bit more happy regarding our the little project is.",
            "It is ok, I, I, I'm already quite satisfied with what we have now. So there is the the few things that really annoy me at the moment, but they are very the limited. And that is to be able to switch off the video. If I enter the MTRL, then PERSON3 is probably not have name language not shown, but. I do not see that as big problem myself, because.",
            "Theres the Let me check it, sorry,, because actually the label should be there.",
            "It should be there? Oh, okay.",
            "Sorry, I was pretty sure that.",
            "I don't see the label.",
            "Me too. But they were.",
            "Oh okay. So maybe there is are beating the developer uploader an update. And indeed, she did not put the correct version, sorry. They should be there. I remember that they were.",
            "And,, what is this back,,, the video that PERSON1 is now. I see the sent me an e-mail this morning,, have not yet to read it. Sorry.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, lets maybe, maybe lets even discuss this, because we know that is also difficult to actually stream the video in sufficient quality. Its difficult to, to, to acquire the the video signal and its difficult to spray. So thats why PERSON1 is considering just sequence of images, such as the slides or streaming. And I do not know if this is, like, what is your opinion? What is your opinion on this, or if the video, a area can be actually those flexible and going to support either the standard video stream or this thing that PERSON1 such as did.",
            "I think that we can reason about it, of course, it could be. I think that when we do not need to have,, real video displayed, but we would like to display just slides. Could be an a good idea to send images, because it still also help us in order to avoid the bend.",
            "Yeah, exactly. And the quality is higher because the image is compressed as an image and not, not like the not.",
            "If its good for the, ASR ORGANIZATION2 I suggest put it in the the requirements. I would like I'm not 100 percent sure that it could be done because I'm not a web developer. But I would like to ask it to our developer for sure.",
            "I think that your remark like the mention of the ASR ORGANIZATION2, I'm not sure, if its good for that or not because they are very actively The organizers are very actively working kind of against slides. So they are everybody is in their jokes is is the best bestowed for not having a video there. So they are trying to in introduce like they they will play some videos create presentations. So yes there will be slides, but they will be also entirely videos, and that is not good solution for In that case, you do not want just to send,, sequence of images. So I think that the images presentation,, is important more important for, standard research talks, and much less for the ASR ORGANIZATION2 itself.",
            "Ok. So, that actually it is not,, number one priority, but its an appreciated feature.",
            "Yeah, I think that, so, PERSON1, PERSON1 was considering this and one of the reasons is the the the the the workshop, there will be actively subtitling that will have either the slides or like a live demo. So we would be opening web-browsers. But then in that case, we cannot also stream,, images. So I do not know what is the best of the best setup.",
            "I don't know, but we can reason about it at least. Maybe we can.",
            "I wanted to do a get back to the, to the way that you are doing the subtitling. Because you had the experience so is just like I do not want to, like push my opinions. I have limited experience compared to the other boys, because you are doing more subtitling sessions than than we.",
            "Yes, but remember that you are the project leader in the UK.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, the way, the delay was introduced was introduced in the early version. It was simply not working. So thats why I, totally like dismiss that. And I I still kind of say, it is, there should not be any delay. And that I still do thing that it should be the only the final layer, the presentation the the we browser if its running.",
            "Software modules of departments are moving in this direction, to try to avoid the delay. We are also trying to prepare the, lets say which probably will not match at all the the history representation, but it could be interesting is that the for subtitle overlay. Unfortunately, some module that still full of box. The application, it is start becoming a pretty complex. But don't worry, we are, we are reason enough, really.",
            "So im thinking, if maybe someone who sessions that we are running. Could use some of your style of subtitling, so that we could see, how the delay works in practice, because right now, the are and the ASR are finally on the quality where I don't know if i told you, but I definetly in in some of the documents that recently, we had PERSON2 colleague of mine speaking Czech on purpose. So there was a talk held in Czech. And there were two Indian students watching it. And they said, \"If we fully focused on the English subtitles we could get the, almost all the content of the talk.\" So there were English So they were happy, about, but they also really pointed out that full concentration was needed. And whenever they looked, when they raised their eyes from the subtitles, the the main screen for the slight as they got lost. And lost. So for them the, the way that we are looking at now. The the subtitle overlay that would be really the best solution. So subtitle overlay over sent images. That is the ideal thing for for this kind of talks.",
            "And do you think that is the Oh, sorry, I probably, I'm going to,,, go out of battery. But we had pretty much finished. Do you think that having the subtitle overlay to possible text is not a problem?",
            "No, I do not think it is problem, because the text of the subtitles flickers a lot and changes. So there is all you can see through that. So even if there is something underneath. You will, there be a point when the speaker's quiet, and then the,, subtitles will disappear, shortly, or they will change. So I think you can read two texts over each other.",
            "Okay, nice. So at least we two sound decision.",
            "So back to my, back to my question,, if you have a set up where you have your cashe subtitling working. Can we see it? Can we run it in one of our senators? Would there be way to put it into the line, so that for example, we have the same language, twice and people would choose. And in your subtitling view, they would choose which, they want to see with the delay.",
            "Well its not possible to have a have two different version. You can choose the first one or the second one.",
            "Have, because where where is it implemented.",
            "In the publishing worker, publication worker, which is.",
            "But still, the publication worker is that a single application? I thought its many different publishing, publication workers, so if youre in two of them. One would be that non cashing, and one would be the cashing one, and they would both, connect to the same works error, which then sends its the to the to the participants. Then there could be two versions, obviously the the language text would be crazy. But we do, we do that quite frequently that we have like we have to check, on, on English. We have English on EN, X zero and X one. So we had. Yeah, we, we often have like three different versions of English, because we are checking the edited and non edited model and.",
            "The audio twice, so that you need to leave the ASR, for the moment we are, we are reasoning about the lets say the tree structure of the boxes in order to.",
            "Now. So, so if PERSON3 is still on the call, if you clould discuss, sooner or later. So PERSON3, if PERSON4 sends different specification of briefing of brains. I think it would be very useful for some of the monday talks, which are held in English to also have English subtitles Also PERSON4 is delays, this cashing more useful for ASR, or for the translation?",
            "I think on the ASR, we probably will benefit small. Because the machine translation, already prepares phrases, in order to be able to translate meaning for phrase.",
            "Not this monday, but in two, in two weeks now or three weeks now. I think it would be very useful to run at one of the Monday seminars, to run a specific test, focused on that flicker like flicker versus delay. And what would be the best experience for the people. There we should have your, your full plan in comparison to our full plan, and our full plan So it would be double audio sent, but we are now connected with wires. So that should be doable.",
            "We will probably require,, one day at least in order to tune everything. And this week we are definetly busy, and also the next one. Maybe the first, or second week of March would be fine.",
            "So plan it. And I would like to see is, so normally you are going, you have the setup for the ASR. So well do it for talk whitch is held in English. So the ASR will be delayed, and also the translation, we should try our way of presenting the subtitles, which include PERSON3, please remind me. Is subtitler included in, in the lines are not anymore? So we only use Sorry, I can't understand. So we should, we should also run the subtitle, or there is this flicker or desire flicker setting, and we should. So before that station. We should just have their ways, the delays, the letters as our three said, \"things off recur, and see which of those we like best. And we shouold see this for the ASR language. And also for some target translation language. If it is here in LOCATION1, then probably Czech. If it is for intenational audient, then probably German.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. Nice. That is all. Think you so much to both of you.",
            "Lets be in touch afterwards. Okay?",
            "Bye. Bye bye."

            "I think PERSON2 said that the agenda is not early like it is not clearly understandable. But I think I PERSON2 you mentioned that it covered all the topics. Okay?",
            "Yeah. It covered all the topics and everything details as mentioned, But it is seeming less than a minute it is seeming to we at points to me. So aga the grammatically this correct all the points are grammatically correct. And there is not seeming to be coherence into it. And so this is what I evaluated this minutes the topics mentioned it is readable, and there is also much relevance enjoy it.",
            "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.",
            "So and all the information is captured. But it is the agenda is the the thing which I found here was that the agenda is not here to me did, Because it's all jumbled, Because we you nee it needs to be like who sometimes there talking something, and then they change the topic. So it needs to be like the the topics should be. So it is less understandable the agenda.",
            "Yeah,",
            "So,, so PERSON2 can I say that this is this is maybe due to the minutes is not grouped into topic.",
            "Yes. Yeah.",
            "For easier follow up like. And minutes mostly followed the linia structure of the of the transcript.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and the minute was focused to note the action point for each topic.",
            "Yes, you are correct. Definitely. So I actually, when we see what is it purpose of minuting. It is after you see, after one month, you should get okay what was discussed in the meeting, right? And what was discussed in we you should know what is supposed to be done. That is the real purpose of minute. So when we see when we evaluate by having that usualling to a mind. So we should we should. It should be something usable tool plus. It should make that focus on. So I had this vision in my mind, When I was evaluating all the minutes.",
            "Okay. So one thing I would like to know from PERSON3, So PERSON3 so the minute is done by someone in a in a in a re in a real time, right? And do you that once the minute has been jotted down by a system or by a human, They should work on it to do to maintain or to group the minutes into topic?",
            "Well, it's actually hard for me to answered. I don't think that need. So it should be kind of clear and understandable. And if it is. Group into topics you mean ta from the point of view.",
            "Of agenda. Yeah. It's on agenda.",
            "I think we are also doing it into automatically also, Because we are we are involving topic PROJECT1 in to. So I think it is supposed to be done or not?",
            "I can not say that they are not really grouped. So the annotators they not how. So from my point of view this minute zero one reflect the flow of the meeting. And when I'm annotated the correspondence the alignment using PERSON5's tool, When I aligned.",
            "These minute for the transkript, These worlds probably the most easy.",
            "Yes.",
            "Connect them to the.",
            "Yes, yes. That is.",
            "It's it really kind of follows. So it's it has different graphical structure, But it is it follows the topics that are.",
            "Yes.",
            "That have been discussed.",
            "So it is there are not kind of there are not kind of. So there is not set that presentations double point something, something, something. That's from this point it is not graphical organized, But from the point of view of time. And from the point of view of how much of information is included. I would say that it has this agenda structure. So it.",
            "Yes, so I must to PERSON3 like why doing the of minutes. One of the is also the alignment thing that we were thinking. So.",
            "So you are thinking.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We could said that was my implicit that was my implicit to annotation tools. To make it easier for the annotators to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, well. Maybe.",
            "So this is this is actually a very good example to work for alignment this this minute.",
            "Lets maybe move to PERSON4. PERSON4, could you give your evaluation for these minutes.",
            "Actually I haven't done an evaluation. I don't follow how do you perceive the evaluation. Do you have a protocol?",
            "No, so so you didn't do it in this way we stop it now, And we do it the next day. So I really asked you very hardly and many times to do the evaluations according to your. It's not according to protocol, But according to your ideas. So read each minutes very attentively. And mark the notes and give your evaluation from different points from. You make use of protocol. You may use the evaluation points that you created that PERSON2 supplied, That you find anywhere else, But also your logical sense. And what you consider to be good minutes, Why you consider compare of them and. So really make formal evaluation based on different points of view, You find and not not point of view that I say. So this was the idea.",
            "What's the point of this? And what's the point of this.",
            "Doesn't matter. It was not really does but it would discuss many times already. So the point of this is it that that we everybody of us understand the how we evaluate the meetings. Not from the literature, But we understand how minutes work. And how minutes are created, What are real problems when minutes are created. And comparing different minutes created by different humans, Which are in the topic, Which are not in the topic. So it's really the work that should be down by you. And retaerly needs a lot of time from you to compare all the minutes, And you didn't do do that. Re kindly ask you to do that till I don't know. Friday not, So well okay. We have to postpone it. If you don't have these evaluation.",
            "But at list do we have the transcripts, Where are the transcripts? The transcripts are the one.",
            "I have sent, I have sent the trancript if one, The minute so the meeting is the same as you did your minutes. So this is these are a nine minutes for the same transcript. I have sent the transcript and and the audio and the audio was incorrect as you told and I sent another audio. The one. So so they correct.",
            "Okay, so can you please resend the whole pack again, Like the trancript.",
            "Okay.",
            "All the summarize once again.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that we know what we are talking about.",
            "I thought we already knew what we are talking about. But well. It's a pitty that you that hav don't have it. Anyway. I will send it again, And we we will have to postpone it, And if we are already on that point I would re I would say that actually it's a good way that we if you follow one by one. And say our notes to that anyway so it could be written, It could be really used some evaluations. When I did evaluations I kind of changed the list of evaluation measures. And addicted them to these concrete evaluation. And from these results I see that it will be changed many more times before we evaluate meetings as we told yesterday with PERSON6.",
            "Okay, so please send us the whole folder again. And I will try to come up with some suggestions, Or I don't know.",
            "Yes, yes. So I really want that you, I I see all of the meetings, Read all of the meetings. And think about think about them.",
            "Yes, so there are all about the same transcript, Right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Only one transcript and some five for to ten summarize. Okay.",
            "Nine. Nine.",
            "Okay, so please send send a whole pack again, And I will do it.",
            "Okay. Then lets do it on Monday? Really.",
            "No I can I can do it in one.",
            "Since please have.",
            "Tomorrow. I do you want to do it tomorrow?",
            "Yes, sure. No problem.",
            "What is at what time? At what time because I want I join this call exactly for the purpose of this discussion of everybody's meeting summaries, And also everybody's evaluation of that. So at what time would it be happening tomorrow? At one?",
            "Yes. No.",
            "Okay.",
            "We normally have the call one.",
            "Yeah. So one is good for me.",
            "Okay.",
            "So yeah, Lets lets.",
            "So tomorrow at one, And actually PERSON4 you already have the transcripts. I will send you the transcript and the audio again. If you one to have it.",
            "We send the whole package transkript of your summarize.",
            "Okay.",
            "In a zipped folder.",
            "Okay, not in a zip folder. To audio.",
            "So I have a question for PERSON6.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So so how would we like the minutes. So it should be life.",
            "Well, did. This online aspect is not that critical. So sorry about the delay they still like it's quite far too place. So so the I I always when I talk about it within the project internally, Then I always presented as life summarization of the of the meetings, But it's not written anywhere in the proposal. So the prop like the the requirement what we promised is just to do summarization. So. I think it's better to have it life, Because it's like flexible, And you immediately see whether it makes sense or not. And it's also more in line with the minuting demonstrator with the wizard of that's discussed separately, like outside of the order teem. It's it's with ORGANIZATION1 that you have heard about it. In in the bigger calls. So it's practically it is better to have it as live thing, Online thing, But this is not promised. So we can always resort to the offline processing, And that is in line with the with the shared task. So the shared task, If you are asking about the shared task the shared task is offline.",
            "Okay, so on this on my question like when we do minuting, So we follow the transcript. And we continuously jot down the important points. That that summarizes the meeting. So in that like having a very structured minute based on some topic in a life scenario humans is not possible unless we do second part of word the minutes that we have jonted down. And then we group the point according to the topic. So unless scenario. What would you suggest. That if should follow the linia structure of the transkript. Or it should be grouped according to the topic, Or I didn't just think.",
            "Well, I it should be grouped according to the agenda, So that is the ideal, That that is the short answer, Because we have specified the tasks as there is this agenda. There is this meeting, Which is possibly still running, Or it has been already finished. And populate the agenda with notes from the meeting, And whatever is not for seen in the agenda then yes that should be edit topic wise at the end of the agenda or something like that. So this is the assignment is extremely flexible in this respect, And we can limited in anyway we like, So that it is easier for us to develop it. It's for the shared task I don't think that we we should give the participants any any requirements on what they should do. I think they are free to do use to to like,, organize a topic wise, Or or based on when the topic was introduce it's it's up to them. And then it's up to our evaluation measure to see, Which of them come sound better. And how how do we compare these difficult to compare things, But it's I I do this on purpose. I I think that it would not be realistic to simplified too much. I think it's it's better to work on and on a procedure for manual evaluation of meetings that can accommodate many different styles of these hierarchical meetings. That already alone is is some narrowing down of of the task. We want the minutes to be hierarchical. So I hope that I've answered your your question sufficiently. So if the the way you can think about this is that we could easily achieve the online behavior using an offline tool by repeatedly running it, And like always restarting it, Always creating the the the minutes so far from scratch.",
            "Okay. Okay, so PERSON3 so could we like started with this minute. So could we like consencus about what was the like advantage and what was the negative point of this minutes.",
            "I think we will come to this consensus tomorrow after discuss it. Not now. It's really don't want to postulate the rules. The idea was that you create the rules at your best understanding of the idea. And then we can very different approaches, And come through what what is better, Was so what better it's lost the situation, Because because it also happens that people do not full of, Also happend it, They get back to that point and agenda the beginning. So there are a lot of different various possibilities. And lets just judge to our best understanding of the minutes, Discuss it tomorrow. And then possibly we will have some back what is better what is worse.",
            "I totally agree with that approach. Is is it is a brainstorming, And it would be spoiled, if someone of you had the opinions from others before doing that tasks himself.",
            "Mm-hmm. Okay. So we yeah yeah so for grouping the minutes into topic like or rather agenda, Because many of times what happend during the during actual meeting is that some topics were int the beginning and then and then again if if point. Yeah, So if we follow a linia structure the fast meeting minute that we just would fill in that it, Becuase it just follow one of the linia there in the transkript. But yeah so if we want like, Because this is a this is a point to merge agenda with the minutes. So yeah, so. I I deal minuting system should like the agenda even if the even if the like discussion many time.",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly. So this is if I would be taking the minutes myself, I would look up the closes matching topic in the agenda. And I would then within that topic have these separate parts. And if they would contribute to the same subtopic than I would again merge them further. So I would I would merge it to the to the topic structure. But it's also acceptable to to do like according to the structure. And even mix it's possible that for some topics you do it topic wise and for some topics you, you do it only sequentially. So this all is this this is something this is one more aspect of the of the minutes, We could say whether the minutes are fragmented or not. So this is some level of like coh maybe have touched upon this with the label coherence, But another label that could be this measuring the same thing or slightly different thing would be the fragmentation. So. This is again another dimension in which the meeting summarize different.",
            "Yeh, so one one I think that is coming up this like I'm also PERSON3 earlier. Through coherence is something which is not very prominent minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But we saw an example of coherence. PERSON3 and I saw an example of coherence.",
            "And especially incoherence, right?",
            "No, I yeah co really the coherence is now a little bit used and more senses. So originally coherence is the actual coherence. And if this is the relations between sentences themselves. So minutes are selfdomly coherent mostly they are written as kind of a bullet points. But in our examples, In our nine minutes, We have one coherent minute minutes, And they are written by PERSON4. When the these are actually not really minutes by kind of summary in a paragraph form.",
            "Yeah. But that is the coherence.",
            "I sure about it. I I really. I have a very strong disagreement about with PERSON3 this respect those. I don't know where she found is the creation of minutes and summarize. But.",
            "It's our own.",
            "Oh, it's your own. Okay. So I I'm big have been conducting in the past month. And I don't see a singles sta singles to distances and the logical and chronological coherence of the of this bullet points of this of this and discourse action that I that I call this summarize.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So this is the empty space that we have to fill and get cited for.",
            "So in the literature literature is completely different, I i it's going direction.",
            "But PERSON4, I have referred you to our people where there are a lot of reference the system how to write minutes. And they are bullet points they are structured. So look at our paper written for.",
            "The citations.",
            "Yes citations there.",
            "Your paper is actually our the paper it's mostly written by.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Remember that paraphrases of that paper are exactly the I'm talking about right now. The is that we are considering the literature, so.",
            "No, your your part is about summarization. And my part is about how minutes look like. Your part text sumarizations. And my part was practically what our minutes and how they look like. And there I have a lot of references to what our minutes.",
            "Not please us with references, Because you have a folder in the we have a folder in the PROJECT1 folder with.",
            "But you can acces that yourself. PERSON4, you you know.",
            "This this paper there. And we will them a. And I will see if there are relevant or. Maybe.",
            "No it's not relevant for literature review reall when for reality. So people who write minutes write them in mostly in the structured way. So when you when we just select when we look at what people summarize. And ma how the agenda look like not involved in this research literature of how summarize are made.",
            "Okay, so please paper to its. What this paper and we will check.",
            "No I'm sorry, PERSON4. Find that paper, And there is a waste of literature there. And the list of references there. And find them and look at that. Because.",
            "Yes, it's it's many cases, In many cases it is not proper scientific papers with.",
            "They are not scientific papers. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, these are like guidelines that appeared on the web, Or there in text books, But where we don't have the PDF. And PERSON3 was probably browsing that text book in library and and so on. So.",
            "Okay, Then I guess not serious. I don't want waste time.",
            "They are not serious, They are not about. This is not.",
            "They are not they are not.",
            "This is are just rules, how to make minute, They are not supposed to be scientific. Never scientific this is just practical guidelines how to create minutes. They have nothing to do with science. But.",
            "Okay. Okay. Okay.",
            "Practical input we want with this input than this input is created according to that guide those guidelines. Like.",
            "Okay.",
            "This is a reality this. And we are make science out of that, But we have kind of real material. And this real material is not structured.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it's not coherent. Sorry.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So it's like two different worlds that have never work together, And we are putting them together. So I that's that's the clear reason why there is so much tension. It's just that we need to accept that the world doesn't behave according to the summaries, according to the to the papers about summarization. And we are trying to to create the missing papers about the real world.",
            "I really like this idea. Yes. So I really like this idea of because like we I also believe that data should be challenging. And then if we like if we work on the data that is already of the we that was problem.",
            "Yeah, okay. Well I have many other things to do. And since the the main topic of today was postponed for tomorrow. Then if you don't have anything for me directly than I would hapily disconect. And work on the other things.",
            "Ou, PERSON6 I wanted to you mentioned please that to you mentioned earlier for vizualization for the. I lost it. I but I lost it.",
            "What was there were I can't remember what exactly was it. What type of diagrams was it? I I don't remember.",
            "The block diagrams in our presentation for modul minuting model. For you suggested some.",
            "Well Inkscape.",
            "Some dot eu I think.",
            "Oh, I know. Inkscape.",
            "Inkscape?",
            "Inkscape.",
            "I definitely I definitely prefer. Yeah. Inkscape.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. Thank you very much.",
            "So it's a it's a plane vector editor, Like of an advanced one, But a good one. It creates as and PDF files. And you can directly directly include these PDFs, So they are skellets vector graphic sentence much better for for publication. So Inkscape that's.",
            "Okay. Thank you very much.",
            "Yeah. Okay. I I know made all of you. So all of you can present, This meeting will last very likely there is no time limit on that. But I need to make someone the substitute host when I'm leaving now. So.",
            "Have you been from the very beginning? So I think but.",
            "No. You started without me, But you didn't have a chance to share screen. So that's the drawback. If I'm not here.",
            "Aha.",
            "So PERSON3 I'll email you separately. But I think you should set up also Zoom account supported. Or founded by the university. And then I could make you cohost from the very beginning. And whenever you would be here, You could allow people to present. So it's there is this limitation that until the host comes nothing can be presented.",
            "Aha.",
            "I didn't know about that before I don't just log today.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I'm now making PERSON3 the the host, right? So I'm leaving the meeting and making the PERSON3 the main host. Okay. So. Thanks. And see you tomorrow.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Bye, bye. Okay. Okay. So, I guess we would be discussing the evaluation tomorrow.",
            "Yes.",
            "And so so PERSON3 do you think anything to discuss about the interface that you want to give to your annotators?",
            "Interface was. I think there we have nothing to discuss about no nothing there. Will be lot of thing but not about the tool of the moment, But rather I would probably like to discuss with you. Should I already lots of ask. Should I address one annotator or more annotators of the same time. How that's process of installation is complicated? Should I just write for example today to one of my annotators. And pro link and refer her to the website with the instalation, Does it work already? And so we can make just a kind of dry run test for one of the annotators how she manages. So what is the better way.",
            "Well, so I think I think PERSON3 we can like just email the. And how to install the interface in Windows or other platform. And then I'll like like one or two days to try on their own. And if they don't success.",
            "Yes it's a good idea. Mm-hm.",
            "Whole the training question.",
            "Yes.",
            "And that okay. This is how we are going to do that.",
            "Do you have some like some this this installation text already?",
            "I'm preparing it an.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we we share it with you. So I'm preparing the Window part and PERSON1 is going the.",
            "Thank you very much. So as far as ready, Please email it to me.",
            "Yes.",
            "Through that and best the annotators.",
            "PERSON5 we should also PERSON5 in.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yes, he can check it. He.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. And.",
            "And by the way, By the way. As as cons as folder tool and installation, Please write down or somewhere something as a important point, That the folder something as an important point that the folder where it is installed is not large to have in spaces, because I have a space in their tool folder, It was PROJECT1 space too, And I couldn't installed it they awfull.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON5 have me to change it, And then then it worked.",
            "Okay. So. Is the folder name should not have spaces.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Any folders in the in the path.",
            "Okay. Anyway if we if we we will be so I'm not or also gonna have more problems. And we can see proble see those problems. And maybe try to solve them. And in case we'll not be able to solve them. PERSON5 is gonna help us. Because he has.",
            "PERSON5's very quick and works of the that.",
            "Yeah. So has actually dis this made.",
            "So I would propose PERSON3 that we we think do the minimum the minimum guidelines send to the annotators.",
            "Yes.",
            "By today. And you think them to the annotators. And I've been to go through that. And also invite them in our Monday meeting next week.",
            "Monday meeting next week. This one. Okay?",
            "In the in the coming weeks, Or they will have some time. Yeah.",
            "No, okay, okay. I will do that.",
            "So they will have some time to like work on that. And then okay. Okay. One.",
            "Okay.",
            "Wonderful.",
            "And.",

            "Yes,, ok. Since I have to record. Oh my gosh, I have internet connection problems so please, really, I'm really sorry, but I think that at some point my connection will fall dramatically. But,, I think that probably in order to record a a back up a video, we need also the inslide streaming. You know, to fill the presentation platform,, video box. What do you think?",
            "Uhuh, yeah, I completely agree with you. So what you say shall we take any random slides, and.",

            "Yes, data is right, though, you, actually, different media was used in a.",
            "Yes, I know, there are two different mediators right now, but workers are connected to both of them or not?",
            "I am checking right now.",
            "Thank you so much.",
            "I check the other one, to figure out how.",

            "Ok. Actually if you are streaming and preparing local URL. URL probably you will be the only one seeing the the also this live streaming which is is fine it's not a problem but in this case. Oh, nice.",

            "One, let me let me verify it,. I think we, we do not have ORGANIZATION11 today. It is just ORGANIZATION4 because I am going to the email right now by PERSON5 and it does not mention anywhere ORGANIZATION11.",
            "Well,, PERSON4 wrote on the general channel this morning saying actually at 11 o'clock he were checking, he was checking the worker's connections so I think that probably he's online actually.",
            "So I just checked into the, and we can not maintain full suite of workers, it would be nice if we narrow it down to one.",
            "Ok.",
            "Or be the one that.",
            "Ok,. If I, sorry, the, my internet connection is really bad today. So if I correctly understood you said,, you are able to provide workers, just for one of the two mediators. Is it correct?",
            "Oh gosh.",
            "I think even I am not able to hear PERSON2. Maybe there is some short of internet connection.",
            "But I can hear you. Boy, it's actually, I will have to go quickly and to verify how long within the server one of our server, so.",

            "Ok, meanwhile,, PERSON6, sorry, may I ask you to try to connect to,, the, try to stream subtitles to the presentation platform so we can start at least testing.",
            "Hello, I think I lost you.",

            "May. May I ask you to try to stream some subtitle to the presentation platform?",

            "So, I just pasted the web link, that's all.",
            "The presentation platform requires the, e, czech.",
            "I, I, I, I am losing you. I am losing you.",
            "Ok, no, I saw your link, so, me.",
            "Ok, so you.",
            "M3, U8 URL, like, let me check stream. Ok, I am searching for an example, just give me one second.",
            "Ok, ok, ok, if you have any arbitrary link that we can use as the.",
            "Yes, but,, yes, but usually,,, commercials, video, or,, Or it's probably something, It's really probably better if its something really related to,",
            "We can use anything, it is short one, that it is our aim.",
            "I can also explain you, how to set up a stream, also in decrease control, There should be,, streaming,, script, but you need to set up, Ok, we can also maybe I, ok, and. Ok, in this live channel, I will see an example of of URL but there could also be the case that I stream something and I record the video so that I can stream. For example, the PROJECT1 website. Let's see, record the video with at least something meaningful in the video box, he let's check this possibility. Just give me one second to set up the streaming.",
            "Ok ok, so how do I get this. Ok, I can see there are two sound streaming with FFPT.",
            "The first example I found in the.",
            "Cruise control there. So, once we test this ORGANIZATION4 platform, we are going to test an alternate web line. So,, because we have issues with the dialog box, the site of the dialog box and the sentence, because it is just two lines and sometimes the subtitles as like more than two lines. So we have a web client ready, and we will be testing that too, as of today.",
            "Ok, you are allowed to test what you prefer, but I stress the fact that we need at least a video of the presentation platform, of course.",
            "Exactly, so once this is done and we are sure that this is ok and up to our expectations, we will move further.",
            "Yeah, just give me one second, that we are setting the streaming. Actually we will be probably the only one seeing the video streaming, but we will be allowed to record by ourself the video and then share it with you.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok ok ok. I think there should have been a readme file for this streaming, so that I could have ran it. Ok, I think I have some camera here, which, which I can run. Ok, I get it.",
            "Sorry, PERSON6, I need to go upstairs one second, sorry.",
            "Ok, sure, sure, sure. Please take your time, yeah?",
            "Hi guys, sorry, I am back.",
            "There was actually some noise here, so I'll just pause for a few minutes.",
            "Hi guys, do you hear me?",
            "Yes, I can hear you. So, do you hear me?",
            "Yes. We actually sees, due to our network problem.",
            "OK, cool.",
            "Two hour network problem. We are not video streaming right now, so we put a static. Sorry. But it will work.",
            "OK, OK.",
            "So, actually we are ready to record the de the demo video. So PERSON6, I know that I needs a lot of time. Are you able and allowed to start,, the subtitles streaming of presentation platform, or we missed something important?",
            "Yeah, yeah, I can start now.",
            "OK. My colleague is recording the video of the webpage,. I can suggest.",
            "OK, I also just start my screen recording.",
            "OK. This is nice,. I suggested to read something related to PROJECT1 project or news or something like this general topic, but PROJECT1 project would be very nice.",
            "I didn't understand you. You mean to say my speech should evolve around PROJECT1, everything around PROJECT1, alright? Is that would you mean to say?",
            "Well, it ‘ s just a suggestion if you have some interesting topic to explain us, we can listen you, really interest.",
            "I, I I would rather go with,, PROJECT1. So.",
            "Yes.",
            "My phone, so that I don't have to switch windows. Alright. OK, I have some document printed to. Yeah I. Sure, sure, sure.",
            "My screen recording seems to work. Or I think you also doing the screen recording, right?",
            "Yes, but a back up is always appreciated.",
            "Yes, because of my screen recording just seems to appear black and just audio. So little on when this demo is over.",
            "Yes.",
            "I would really appreciate if you could share me the recording.",
            "Yes, of course, but since we get one safe, it ‘ s better if we both record something and we will see.",
            "OK, so the restart.",
            "The MT ‘ s from ORGANIZATION6, I told him. I really appreciate if this stay the safety purpose.",
            "I see the English subtitles, but not the translations.",
            "Yeah, because the MTs from ORGANIZATION6 are not running, let me try.",
            "But the,, the ORGANIZATION13 one? The ORGANIZATION13 workers, you also provide the machine translation, if I call you to remember. Is it correct?",
            "OK, OK, no, no, don ‘ t worry, don ‘ t worry.",
            "Do we also have the MT workers here? We have but,, is, it's like not running now. OK, so.",
            "I my input volume, so that there are noises here. So you don't hear.",
            "OK, do you set we will be able to some better,, the interest party and ask them to. OK, so is in this connect, let me check.",
            "OK, so he is using. OK, so PERSON2 says that they are running on 60021. OK I think I'm too.",
            "So, OK. Connection problems and I, everything, what? Maybe it's better in the afternoon?",
            "I am losing you broken voice.",
            "I think that. I think if you have Windows in your computer, you have a LAN connection. Is that right? Wire connection in your computer.",
            "I see the English subtitles.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I, I am going to fix it now.",
            "OK, I am also writing on the ORGANIZATION5 channel.",
            "OK, alright.",
            "OK, PERSON6, are, are you fine with what I wrote on the ORGANIZATION5 channel?",
            "Oh, I am going through it,, please one moment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, I agreed you, and I agree with you, that English ASR is working but the MTs are not.",
            "But I, I, I have stopped the ASR for, for, for, for now,.",
            "Shall I run the ASR again, or do I, like, wait for the MT?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Do I run the ASR again, or, like, do I wait for MT?",
            "Just we have to wait, that the machine translation services are available, so that we can record a 3 minutes video.",
            "Ok, ok, because I see the MTs from ORGANIZATION6 they, they, are not dist. They are not -",
            "Yes, PERSON7 is providing coordination on this ORGANIZATION5 channel, just wait a second, have faith,",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, yeah, very nice, yeah.",
            "Ok, I,,, thank you.",
            "Ok,, so PERSON3, right now the MTs are running from ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Oh, nice.",
            "And I can run the ASR czech and, czech and german, cool, cool, cool, so here.",
            "Ok, I see the english subtitles.",
            "No, they are not running. I mean they are running, but someone else is using all.",
            "Oh my gosh.",
            "There something wrong. Aha, ok, sorry, sorry. Ok, I, I there, no.",
            "Oh.",

            "Ok, I so.",
            "Ok, you are allowed to start using the.",
            "Ok, so you can, I can start recording.",
            "Yes, we are, we were already recording. We record the whole session.",
            "Ok, so, ok, ok, so what do we do next?",
            "Well, you can start reading something relating to the PROJECT1 project or some topic.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, so I will start. Ok, so I will read the relation to the work program, so. Running the public administration of business in a multilingual environment that requires frequent and, and, undelayed communication across languages. Our two partners, ORGANIZATION12 and ORGANIZATION3, are typical representatives of two major types of industrial users. ORGANIZATION12, the ORGANIZATION12 of the Czech Republic and an active member in the ORGANIZATION7 ORGANIZATION1, contacted ORGANIZATION13, in late 2016, seeking for technological guidance and support in ORGANIZATION12's contribution to the ORGANIZATION1 mission. Improving cooperation and innovation among the 50 congress, among the 50 ORGANIZATION1 members. ORGANIZATION12 as part of its upcoming presidency, presidency of ORGANIZATION1, will be joining the ORGANIZATION1 congress in May 2020 in LOCATION1, and the aim is to provide automatic interpreting into the languages of all audit reports and other documents by ORGANIZATION1 members into all ORGANIZATION1 languages. Even this particular domain of public administration language barriers cause a considerable hindrance for both written and spoken form of communication. Audit documents are created in national languages and translated only into English, if at all. To keep translation costs manageable, at the same regular employs, holidays of ORGANIZATION10s are not expected to speak foreign languages at live meetings. Representatives often lack sufficient language proficiency to actively participate in the discussions, anyway, in English. The communication can be difficult, with strong accents of international participants. Interpreting is not always available, not to mention its cost. ORGANIZATION3 offers the ORGANIZATION11 video conferencing platform to many companies and institutes, to facilitate meetings regardless of their location. This project should lead to new opportunities for connecting people, not just location, independent but also regardless of which language they speak. Professional interpreters represent a high cost factor, which is difficult to justify for small meetings or training courses. A video conference conferencing system, with integrated translation and automated minuting, brings a new level of efficiency within a corporate context. That new development will facilitate and improve exchange for companies with their offices, subsidiaries, or partners across country borders. So I think is this ok, or do I need to read more?",
            "May I ask you,,, just for test,? I hear you reading really really fast. Are you experienced in ASR technology, do you know how the consolidation of hypotheses works? PERSON6 do you hear me?",
            "No, I think maybe.",
            "Ok, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.",
            "Yeah, I hear you loud and clear. Ok, so I think maybe PERSON7 would be the right person to answer this.",
            "No, no, no, stay, stay, please, please stay, I am just giving you the suggestion.",
            "I am staying. I'm here, I'm here.",
            "Try. Ok, ok. Try to read, to slightly, slowly, especially think of pauses on full stops because pauses are interpret as, ok, one sentence is finished, and can go the next evaluation. May I ask you to read,, just one paragraph.",
            "Ok. Sure, sure, sure, so I rather.",
            "Nice, just one paragraph. We do not need to repeat everything, ok? Thank you.",
            "Ok, ok, sure, let me find, fine and easy. Yeah, so. Our main technical innovations will be geared towards unified natural language processing platform, in comprising robust adaptable speech recognition, enter into spoken language translation, machine translation capable of handling hundreds of language pairs, and considering the entire context of the document, and automatic summarization of discussions into meeting minutes. The.",
            "I don't know what happened. I see no subtitles at all right now. PERSON6 do you hear me? Some internet connection problem maybe. PERSON6 do you hear me?"

            "Yes, I'll write it in the chat. Othervise it is always in the description of our meeting in Zi in ORGANIZATION2 in ORGANIZATION1. Like I will.",
            "So.",
            "Yes, in the meeting invite.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I this works. This is. It contains the work again, The word share and you again. Is it work?",
            "This could be PERSON4 if you can put the links in the Hangout chat, So that link's still there?",
            "Hangouts chat this is what? ORGANIZATION2 meet?",
            "Yeah, You know in the in the Hangouts chat in that Gmail chat that we are.",
            "Yes.",
            "Coffee.",
            "Yes, I yes I understand.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Oh, okay. Just a moment.",
            "The word the link would be gone so it's better late with.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a moment. Is it work? Yes. Sorry. PERSON1 is not here. I have written her through ORGANIZATION2, Through Hangouts and she didn't react. Hangouts claims that she three years ago.",
            "Okay. So PERSON4 maybe you would want to start this maybe?",
            "Yes, But well it's actually pitty that PERSON1 is not here, Because I had to I wanted to discuss the tasks with her. Almost primal primary they actually. But maybe before she comes we could start with so this is some share task issues? And maybe you have it already clear, But this maybe this is just my question to you that I want to make it clear. Do you know so I just thought about the tasks that we give to share task. And its evaluations in general, Because I know so I have so I have seen the list list of tasks this A to D, But I just. And if we give task task see a main one, Which I considered to view logical and good, We have we have to so we work on evaluation. And all of it is contains a lot of problems. And a lot of unsolved issues. So all evaluation will be subjective, Anyway it's not so it's clear. And we should work on it, It's also clear. And we should kind of devi explicitly know who is working on what. And if so PERSON1 if documented PERSON3 prepare it does it mean that PERSON3 is able to makes some kind of subjective. And evaluation at this moment, Or should it be developed more. And the next question is who is going to developed? And for other measures who is at the moment. So this is one question. And the second question is shared tasks are es kind of easier tasks that now I just started over. And I think it is also good to put this easier task, Maybe do can connect A and B together, Maybe not. So it's on us. But for this tasks we have clear evaluation evaluation. Isn't that. It just yes and no, And we we know what is yes. And what is no. Is it so? And do do understand it correctly? I should just just want to make it clear picture of what is going on.",
            "Yeah, so that that's what was in my mind. PERSON4 because you mentioned at some time of even I give two minutes belongs to just same tasks it's difficult.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I.",
            "This is.",
            "Yeah, so I thought that if could be one filer subtask. That we would want our participant list. And yes it it would be definitely plus we that okay is is it is it belongs? Yes, or no? So.",
            "Yes, yes. So I think we should definitely included, Because this is what we can provide at least some evaluation for. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And this is the task what should we also discussed with PERSON1. She began to work on. So my original task I gave to PERSON1 was to work on distinguishing belonging to the same same minutes. Or belonging to different belonging to same meetings or belonging to different minu meetings. So she sure original task was to define this point, And she already worked on that, And she had some results. So maybe we could. At least now we can know what it what was it for. And to use your experiments for these measurement. Or for as a sys is one of this system. So kind of organizing uh-huh. And yes, Iii is it is it okay and is it clear? Is it so am I consider and correctly? The same is you do?",
            "Yes, so PERSON4 can you make just write then email to PERSON1 maybe? If it is possible, Because I think these discussions like. She she should she should be, Because she she has worked on this.",
            "Yes, yes. Definitely.",
            "So she should have more idea than I.",
            "She doesn't she doesn't answer yeah now. I don't know. PERSON1 again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Don't se that's that's.",
            "Oh I have sent your an email, Should we postpone our meeting if you really need PERSON1? I don't know. She doesn't.",
            "I really think that she should be here, But otherwise you have to repeat the same thing again. So.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "There is.",
            "Other is all my two days topics concern PERSON1, That's why I don't know what to this.",

And in that case if it that happens I will leave the room, But connected to the all. I think it is still better in terms of some quality. Then if we three sit next to a single machine. Hi everybody.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "So great is that is that all, Or are you still expecting someone PERSON8? I think it's all, Right?",
            "Yes. Is not.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay. So, well, I would happily let PERSON8 and PERSON7 to lead the the call again, And I will observe, but I'm delighted to to have a PERSON3 all on on the team first, And like for for the first time. So that's my big thanks for. And for for PERSON3 to to agree. And go on that the risk of remote working, And we will see how that will work out in in the coming months. So that's only a warm welcome from me, And then PERSON8 and and PERSON7 will will say most of the content.PERSON8 Okay, So so, first of all welcome. And I think you've seen most of us. But if you for first time this also working on the project. And as far as these meetings are concerned, We we are just doing the the basically weekly report on a how how how things are progressing. So so basically, this week let see another right attandace, It's it's sure. So basically we have two running projects right now, Or minute minute projects or call it. So first of all to PERSON7 is there any progress this this in the last week? Was there any progress? Yeah, PERSON7 your music?",
            "Sorry. So I'm working on the student models, And because five last week, Or I think it was last week, I was hesitating, whether you to use them or not, Then I decided to use them. And but the way how to come up with them it's big. And now I'm instead the end of the step four from from five steps. And the the fifth step is the most complicated I think because the quantitation. And I need to build the specific PROJECT2 for that, And yeah so now I try to build build the PROJECT2 and it failed. I don't know why. So that the status of PROJECT6. PERSON10 asked me what's the status look like today morning and I'm I'm also not happy with this situation and I. If I should have decided for the like staying with PROJECT4. There si another problem that student model student model seems to be seems to have, quite special from Czech to English system have very low performance. I don't know I'm now measuring, what's the performance of the original PROJECT4 just to compare it. But first thing bless core from Czech to English I think it's to low. But.",
            "What's what's the reason to not go back to PROJECT4? It's a because personal investment in.",
            "Yeah. Because I'm already in the step four from five. But yeah if we if it the problem is that the fifth step is the most complicated, And it can like fail several like.",
            "And do you know what the was on the tens PROJECT4 model?",
            "I'm just measuring it because I'm I'm running it on on CPU. So it's taking on to to translate like 3000 sentences, Because I don't want to invest more time to.",
            "Obviously.",
            "Make PROJECT4 run on CPU because these was train by phone calls me, and it's not already available, Or I could ask him but I don't want to disturb it. Another job.PERSON8 Okay. So so basically the lower performances already on the teacher model for Czech English?",
            "For teacher model it it wasn't. Now I try what .PERSON8 But but teacher, it teacher is fine basically.",
            "Teacher seems to be fine, I think. Check it. Just PERSON8 So the problem is with the with the student models, right?",
            "Yeah. I guess so, One one it Czech to like teachers, Okay, Czech to English teach.",
            "Yeah, sorry, Another urgent call. I'm back.",
            "The Czech to English teacher was was was, Yea it was quite good plus score.",
            "So it regress by printing points.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "But I'm not sure these whether we. Now I think this is correct.PERSON8 Yeah, but the ORGANIZATION4 was doing the distillation, Right? Train the students, and and they didn't report any any like problems like the the same.",
            "Yeah, because ORGANIZATION4.PERSON8 Okay, so so there is probably a problem in the process, right?",
            "I think that was I was afraid that it it would be more problematic than just to follow their instructions and uhm.PERSON8 Yeah, so so on Friday. Was asking whether whether who who was actually training these models, right? And he was suggesting ORGANIZATION4 can handle it or you know. I don't know.",
            "I'm not sure he was suggesting it. I I know that he asked me that I should report any problems that I have already like least of 15 or 10 problems there are things that are not really use not like not in good user experience. With model.PERSON8.",
            "I don't know for for whom these instructions are like aimed or whom they are aimd, But you have to you have to added the script a lock. And it's not documented at all. Most of the things, yeah.PERSON8 Okay.",
            "But the regression seems very significant. So. There is some problem, and we will needs or you will need to again. Suddenly want to reconsider using.",
            "Yeah. That was, that's why I'm now measuring what's the origin was the blessed core of the PROJECT4 on news test 2017, Just to have a fair comparison. I don't know what was the PROJECT4 score, And if a PROJECT4 score is also arounds 17, Then it's okay, because those systems were fine for us. Yeah.",
            "And do you know when the lets all it? Overnight or?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Do you know when when the testing will finish that? Overnight?",
            "Now I have like already half of the data translated in like. I think tonight it should be done.",
            "Worker workers so I then I found out that I can run like the data to keep part. And run the model in paralel on the same machine. So faster now.",
            "Yeah, and and you are talking about good Czech model. And not the bad Czech model.",
            "Is a bad Czech model.",
            "The bad Czech model. So the yeah, okay.",
            "Model I didn't the bad Czech model to be worse.",
            "To be worse than, to bad. Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, So we will decides tomorrow.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Lets. Because the yeah. I don't know how much like the fifth step there is complicated. And when I asked the ORGANIZATION4 do it will like it would be delay even more. Yeah. I I shouldn't have I shouldn't have gone for this for this student.",
            "For for the student. So well. That was my fault, I I pushed you to do this. So don't feel bad.",
            "Yeah. That's sure that that it would be better I desided to okay. Let's try.",
            "And is the good Czech model in the student version working well, Or not even that?",
            "Yeah, it's working.",
            "Okay. And there was created by ORGANIZATION4 people? Right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So the thing is that we probably cannot reproduce the distillation. That's what the to note in the meeting report says, But the distillation itself for people who know how to do which works.",
            "I think so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because here it might be also the problem with the like size of the data, now I'm working with only five million of data. And I I don't know whether like the or in performance is not.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Because of that that that's the student models.",
            "Are more sensitive to the to the lack of data?",
            "Yeah, yeah. And I also, I also using the alignment, Because reqiured forced alignment. And PERSON10 and PERSON8 suggest to to train another system without alignment. I haven't data. So so far. But it it may be another like problem, Because the alignment is done only on on those five milions sentences which is not.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So I can definitely understand the the alignment gets worse, But also that the deterioration of the student si like much more pronounced. If there is less training data. So the the the teacher should be weak. That's what we want from it. But the student should be trained on a very large data set translated by the weak student. That's the difference. If you know what I mean.",
            "Yeah. I know what you mean, Yeah. But I decided on it on it to to use like the teacher to train only on those five millions sentences and then then translate on it those five milions sentences. And that this problem that I should have translated like many sentences.",
            "Yeah, And how much was it complicated our evaluation set up like the the let in squares, So the say. If we used three models for Czech. If we used T to T original the big one. So the good T to T. The bad T to T and the student for. The one that is working. The, the student train by ORGANIZATION4 people.",
            "Yes, as of now we don't have any idea about the number of participants that ORGANIZATION4 below the provide. So I would plate safetly and provide less number of configurations, Because we already have like what fourteen or fifteen, PERSON7 do you know exactly?",
            "8 times 3, 24 I guess.",
            "Okay. So now we have 24 configurations. And and no idea about number of participants.",
            "This will go by like three times like one half larger larger again, Like so in step to of 24 tt will be a 36.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think that if tomorrow if the numbers.",
            "Yeah. So if the if the numbers the bless course do not like rescue us, risk you us. If the blows course will indicate that the student for the bad model is really much worse than the teacher for the bad model. I would go for the three models that I just such a state without ask in ORGANIZATION4 to to train if for us again. Because we have these three models, yes. We have to find more people or ORGANIZATION4 has to find has to find more people, But we will have two comparisons that are both interesting. One of the comparisons is the quality of the T to T models so good model versus bad model. And they are both at the same speed, The the response to the user. And of the comparison is the fast good model versus the slow good model which is teacher T to T versus the PROJECT2 student. So, so these two comparisons are both interesting, And we would learn whether it is more important to have the good response rate, Or the the good quality kind of.",
            "PERSON9, you said 3 models, But you ment 4. Right?",
            "Like including the Estonian.",
            "Oh, well, I don't I was talking about one language. So.",
            "Okay.",
            "So for Czech this will be three models.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "So let's wait for tomorrow, to to know if the T to T bad model was also around blow of 17. And if if we have to stay with constraints, I strongly recommend to also add the existing student for the good model.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Because that will that will half way make the reviewers happy. And it will add one more interesting comparison.",
            "Yeah. Okay, yeah, PERSON8 Okay, so. We can want to the multi service. So how are you progressing from PERSON2, that the experiments are. So.",
            "Yeah the experiment there running, But yeah like last week, Because PERSON2 did a mistake in training and we get we got like 15 blessed. Or for from English to Czech, which is really strange.PERSON8 Yeah. Yeah, I have heared about it to translating to the same language in.",
            "Yeah, and I like replicated the experiment with the correct like we have everything under control. And and like then found out that he was training on. Some like data that is already containing information of development no no no. He was I don't know, I can it so so he was doing the he did a mistake. And then now we are running those experiments again, And like nothing nothing promising is there so far. We like we are running monolingual pre-training. Or monolingual system with original data. Then we the on back translated data and another one or another another two onper freud data. And then we are running multilingual or yeah multilingual with tho incoders, And we recombination those or sources. So originally back translated original with paraphrased. And so far the original is better and or the mono like the one source is better then multiple sources. Yes, so I'm not bit skeptical now about the result all these experiment. And so PERSON2 is also running like this this is some of the experiments he is running in ORGANIZATION4, Because he is like enough sources there or resources. And yeah. running some of them ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Yeah, so sorry. PERSON2 was not fully paying attention what are the multiple sources? And like this single sources bad than PROJECT8does it hold for any of the multiple sources? Or dd what more different single sources tried?",
            "I don't have yeah like I I have numbers from what I have run, Because PERSON2 I don't know whether he when he started training it. I think today the the other two sources. But this one like back translate if plus. No sorry original original data plus back translated it running and original plus the result of the ORGANIZATION2 rewriter and the second one has 25, the first one has 23 blue score.",
            "Do you have some notes written down some worse,, maybe could you share your screen so that we also see the numbers or is it in the document or.",
            "Okay. I can share. Yeah, yeah, I can share the screen of the.",
            "Because it's easier to to follow.",
            "Yeah, that's right. Where is it?",
            "Yeah. Okay. This one share. Okay, can you see it?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "And we even see PERSON2's courses. Like document at the moment.",
            "Yeah. So this is the baseline, It's 26. It's.",
            "It's train on the origin still running, We can can the even more. Here this is the baseline on back translated data only.",
            "Um-hum. Which is surrounding equally long. So it's kind of comparable whe.",
            "Yeah, it's kind of comparable. Yeah.",
            "The number of steps. I see yeah.",
            "Yeah.Yeah. And then we have these multiple sources. And I'm running these two, The numbers there reported. This one is comparable with this two, This is kind t PERSON11 because you need like to validate it in it original and back translated data, Instead of instead of the back translated data or or instead of instead of the data validation data produced in the same way as the training data were previews. I use the this TB0 validation data. So that's why the score here is lower or I think that's that's right.",
            "I don't, yeah. I don't don't understand it. So you have some English input. And you are adding secondary English input.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the secondary English input either come back from translation. So the reference was available to the back translating system? Or.",
            "Reference was like on the train data, yeah.",
            "So the back translating system still has not seen. Well. The back translating system was trained on the training data. The sentences from an independent held out test set, But the the back tranclating system was run on the reference. And it produce English from that. And this English now serves as secondary source. So. If the if the back translation system a would be somehow cleverly like linked with the former translating system, They could possibly in combination like sneak in the exact preference. This is not going to happen. But it the back translating system has access to the reference that we want to -",
            "Yeah, I I I I don't know now how the back translation system will done. Because this was done from by PERSON2 and.",
            "And.",
            "But is probably trained on the same paralel corpus. Just the reverse direction,.",
            "He used he used some some system from ORGANIZATION4. And I don't know.",
            "How system in ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Okay. So could be some older version or whatever review we don't know. So the that there the the chance of.",
            "I I have like I have total control hu 100 like on this ORGANIZATION2 zero.",
            "Done by me. And.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so the I I'm just.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I'm just checking for any risk of the systems cheating for us because the the they. They would be very clever, If they could do that, but I don't think there is any any such risk. It's just important to to be, or whether of the fact that the back translating system essentially s had access to the reference. So it could produ it could produce some like magic cryptic compressed version of the reference,, If these systems were trained in in a both the forward and backward translation. I'm sure that the neural networks would do this cheating, But they are not trained, there are run just once. So there is this risk is is reduced or or nonexistent. So now the the ORGANIZATION2 the ORGANIZATION2 paraphrased there was created on whatever add the data totaly independent. And if you look at the English sentences, They are sensible, right. And the these multiple sources, Yeah. So the the lower bliss course still do not necessarily mean that the translations are worse. It could also mean that the translations are different less like fine tuned to the news, Singular friends. And, I think that we should. We should like look at them manually. And then later on it would even be necessary to evaluated manually, Because I think it's quite possible that the translations was the PROJECT8 system are like more general general like more robust at. So they they like flattened out any any highly specific and risky senses of words, For example. So they can be more useful in practice. And the blessed course will not indicate this. One way which could help us here would be to evaluate on multiple references, So there is I think 2013 has more references. So if we if we went to another year, Then we could have more reliable bless course. But I think it's ea even better just for, for us to look at the outputs. And and quickly check if we should truss these course or or not. So the questions whether we should blame the idea of PROJECT8, Or whether we should blame the the blessed course.",
            "Because for for for deliverable the experiments in there are forming on. He was. He performed only on small data, And with neural monkey.",
            "And only on small data. So that's why it helped there but it it maybe just it's maybe just the consequence of the small or a small amount of training data.",
            "Yeah. And that was the PROJECT7 30, PROJECT7 PROJECT7 30 key was that they again. Or different data set?",
            "Sorry, With?",
            "Was it the PROJECT7 30K data the the image captioning data set, Or was it reuse training data in the news domain?",
            "I like for the for his experiment with. I don't know what what would his data. I think. Yeah, I know I know. Sorry. He trained only on one tense of channel.",
            "And now we are running it on the full channel.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or one tense.",
            "Was it this yeah.",
            "Maybe milion.",
            "100 or just a milion sentences? Yeah.",
            "Milion sen I don't know. Very small part of PERSON4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "One section.",
            "So that's.",
            "60 sections or 60 million.",
            "PERSON4 has 100 training files. And two of these are label and test set.",
            "Okay. So.",
            "0 is 0, 00 till 97.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "That's the that that's the check 0.6 and 0.7. And I'm not sure about 2.0.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I think.",
            "I I think not that this has 60 milion.",
            "60, okay.",
            "Yeah, that's it. Pairs.",
            "So that's pairs, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I think if if you can show us the outputs, The actual outputs of the the baseline verses the different sh PROJECT8 runs? And from that we can hopefully assess whether it is indeed deteriorating the quality, or if it's like a moving away from the references without damaging the the translation quality. And based on this observation, we should then debug further.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And I think it is as on its own. It's already in interesting observation that the PROJECT8 is useful for smalles data sets and doesn't work for large data sets. This is something which like that calls for better had had.",
            "Be t.",
            "Because like in the experiment for deliverable. We will be different approach how to combine the sources. Like here we use some old approach. In PROJECT2. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I I don't really know how it how it can be categorizing the.",
            "PERSON2s describe in their paper of multiple sources. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah.",
            "So all I want to say in in general is is this like this is very good progress, And the fact that the PROJECT8 seems bad the first side does not mean that this is like a useless message at all.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So that's that's good. So if you if you can share the translations.",
            "We wanted to try also. And yeah these are the results here at the bottom, But I tried it only on yes, But this these numbers are completely wrong. Because if the yeah we evaluated the on on the back translated validation set, So it these data has already somehow comprised the reference inside.",
            "And that while all scores are so high, But like compared with the like the original system here performance like 35 or even 40 yeah and my modem 40. Yes, so. And this is just the one source, But it's concatenation, like.",
            "It had a source sentence, Then some like tag.",
            "The limiter and paraphrase.",
            "Yeah. And and a paraphrase. And then I tried also getting the unique like.",
            "Puting there only one sentence. If the the two are the same. And shuffling than randomly changing their order. And yeah. Like.",
            "And that's worse.",
            "Apparently, this doesn't work for fake paraphrases. A fake paraphrases paraphrases is another experiment, And we use completely random paraphrase.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "The paraphrase corpus. And based in to the to the sources.",
            "Um-hum. So, like a wrong sentence, Confusing sentence.",
            "Just to find out was it dependens. Because here we also don't know whether I would like to. Yeah. I need to replicate this experiments with this multiple PROJECT8 setting. I mean the experiment we fake sentences. Because again.",
            "I I don't know whether these 25.1 whether it comes also or was it contribution of zero here. Whether it doesn't just look at the the first source in the end. And just ignore the zero.",
            "Yeah. So you shuffle the order?",
            "I should shuffle the order of zero. And find out like was like the dependence on on on.",
            "Yeah. And also remember that here both the training data. And the test data this actually like perfectly fluent sentences. And our plan to use this is the user generated content, The the partial sentences what potentially some typos that the user is entering. So the, the one of the paraphrases one of the inputs may contain the typo which is been later on corected in the other paraphrase. So this is another angle another difference of the intended setting. And the and the the now now the tests here. So there when the noise in the inputs then suddenly even with the biger data the PROJECT8 can can be useful.",
            "Mm-hmm.Yeah.",
            "So we should also probably introduce some errors,, in like the the common types of errors to see if that would help. Because we don't have the added yet from below. Or do we? Would we have to enough data for a for a real test set with paraphrases that were created by the the anotators?",
            "I I'm sorry. You mean from the first PROJECT6 or?",
            "Yes. Yeah, yeah. So se variance of sentences that could serve in in this PROJECT8 experiment.",
            "That's not for training, northward. Because, because low low number of people.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Five anotators. So I don't know it was about 200 sentences. And 50 so for paraphrases per source.",
            "So we can take all the pairs for example, And that suddenly creates a big enough test set. But there is a lot of competition on target side.",
            "I I I mean it's it's not a paraphrase per se, Because those are different answers to the same stimulate which doesn't have to be paraphrase. Because the post the questions differently ask about different topics. Etc.",
            "Yeah. But I mean, that data that we need are always coming from a single person,, on a particle single stimulus. And what we want is the different variations of the sentence that that the user produced.",
            "Okay, But in this case we don't know whether what like if you recall ten this first but it was not very precise, Because.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We need to some whether this train the users lock or produce is is finish sentence.",
            "Yeah. I think it could be interesting to run the experiment even with like unfinished sentences. So imagine that the user has once finish the whole sentence that the longest output. And then he deleted some words as at the end, And then started from the middle with another continuation of the sentence, And I would like. Yeah?",
            "Okay, so okay. I can persistent. But. What exactly should I should be you. Should my out to be?",
            "Pairs of different variations of the input, As the user is kind of formulating what he is trying to express. And one of those should be probably the full sentence. Either the first valuable. Or the final one. Either of these, So. And the other one u, could be a full sentence. Or even a partial one. So I can imagine user interface where I would be typing one sentence. And then I would be deleting it. And I would be writing again the second half of the sentence. And the system we're already include what I have written in the first one, And I would have to like a click click reset button, So that it would forget all my previous words. So the idea would be that the system is eagerly trying to incorporate whatever I have mentioned. So if there was like subliminal information in my input. It would be included from the past that I deleted. It would be still included in in the translation.",
            "Okay. But if you want me to send you every pair of this segment. And the number of some of the number of these pairs is very very high.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I don't know how to fill the demo, How to sample some interesting ones.",
            "Okay, but but my question should I insist on pairs. And not like. Like the whole.",
            "Yes. Yeah.Yeah. Yeah. And apples is even better.",
            "Okay. And we I should test them?",
            "So maybe to PERSON7 to. So that PERSON7 would check if how far this is from a being useful input for the existing systems. So the existing systems are trained strict on pairs. Right? So there is no way to make use of other elements in thi in this list.",
            "Yeah, it's it's train on pairs. And yeah we don't know how to how to make this system. Or out just the system, so that it's able to train on variable number of sources. This is this this just two encoders. So you need two sentences.",
            "Okay. So I will ISSN as this data set. And some of them.",
            "So that we see whether it makes sense that all to like pursued this PROJECT8 idea with the inputs coming from the PROJECT6 set up.",
            "Yeah, but we don't to be. Like we have the inputs which are variations. And don't we also need the outputs? I get translation?",
            "That's true.",
            "I mean we can take the final one. But there is no guarantee that this one is going to be.",
            "But we have the scoring. What did the translation was good. Right? So if the translation was good. According to the second valuator or the second annotator. Then we can trust that this is the reference.",
            "Okay, But like the set up they are creating here is that we provide one source sentence, which is in finished unfinished then the second source sentence with just finished. And from the second sentence the translation is made.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. I mean it's just representative but okay, okay.",
            "Yeah, it's the best that we can get.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think we we will have the similar testes from the PROJECT6 tool. And I have some I have program already some like program that filters only I I still have to incorporate some maybe filtering out the clear typos.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And yeah. Because PERSON10 has already had some some like filtering of all thos all those options or or were locked by the system when the user was rephrasing the sentence. And then I made some like to like even improve it. And now like if filter like even sentences. Or I like it like in the end we have even sentences that are like reasonable paraphrase this. Or unfinished unfinished sentences. Yeah.",
            "Okay and.",
            "So for the PROJECT6. So we can get these from the PROJECT6 too experiment. And we can have then we can asked for translation for the 4\\. viable, Or the final and maybe some intermediate version of of the sentence. I don't know. And then we can get this this they. Or am I wrong? Am I say something wrong or?",
            "Should I processed PROJECT6 one data. Or PROJECT6 two b data?",
            "And for PROJECT6 two data we don't h. Yeah we some.",
            "More anotations then from the first one.",
            "Okay. Yes, so we can use the one sorry two.",
            "Okay.",
            "I don't know what's the differents with. I I know what's the different but yeah I can now.",
            "Start two different domains. Because plans.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Okay, So I will processed PROJECT6 two data. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the I don't remember the difference.",
            "But that should I then. Because now I'm confused w w because we have a deadline. Now on Saturday.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I'm not gonna processed until until then. And then I have two weeks of and or maybe not two we one week definitely then then one week in LOCATION1 and then one or two weeks of. And.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I'm I'm not going to process this. So if you want to rely on me with this.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "It will like.",
            "It will one month or more.",
            "This and the second PROJECT6 experiment will be planning it to start before your vacation. Or after?",
            "I aa hh, the start of the second PROJECT6 yeah, I would like to start as soon as possible.",
            "Okay and before you leave or after?",
            "It should be tomorrow. If I understood our question.",
            "This week this weekend.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so either.",
            "Two weeks ago.",
            "Or frustrated.",
            "So either, either we started with two systems. Or with three systems? And two systems would be the two PROJECT2's if the blow scores for the student T to T, Sorry if the if for the slow for the for the bad T to T. Are equally bad as the student scores? Or it would be three systems, and, yeah. And I think the experiment can start tomorow. So back to the the deadline, So what what, what are we access submiting to?",
            "Mm-hmm. We are just working on the PROJECT8, But it has no like reasonable results so far.",
            "I'm also I didn't starting to be kind woried that we are not going produced anything here. So like.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, Like problems that's fail retrain on differents data. And now we are training data the like the results are in terms of score there are not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or better than the than the base one.",
            "So well. There were papers were paraphrasing helped, So like giving a second view on this a second evaluation on the much larger is is off interest. So if we diagnose so why is it worse, The why the PROJECT8 is worse than than the single source, Why the scores are lower, That alone would be an interesting message. So in contrast with other people's work.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is where I would now like drive to most attention to to explain.",
            "Okay, I think I can I can today the PROJECT8 again with.",
            "The 13.",
            "Other with paraphrases.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Just to find out what's the dependence of the PROJECT8.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Paraphrases include. On And if you can also run the existing all the train models that you have on the WT13 which is the more references?",
            "Okay.",
            "That would also help. And if you can look at they outputs with your eyes simply. And and confirm what of the lower blow scores actually is visible. The difference between to 26 and 23 should be visible as a worst translation?",
            "If it's really worst translation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the the starting point will be the previous papers that suggested that PROJECT8s good. And we would say well, If you have enough data then not really.",
            "And like here there like the differences not 23 than 26, 25 and 26. Yeah? Diferrences not to big. But yeah we wanted to to want to to see inprovement that the we see just the bigger deterioration. But this is like both of the system are still running, Yeah so this are just result.",
            "So I can imagine that the PROJECT8 needs more steps to get the same performance.",
            "Yeah. The that's true that this there is still whole for.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This 27.",
            "27.",
            "27, yeah, exactly, yeah. And for the question of multiple. And like arbitrary number of sources? The proper way is to come up with some aggregation of the encoder output. So you would run the encoder as many times as many inputs you have. And then you would average those or whatever. And then you would run the decoder once on these aggregated processed input sentences. So that obviously requires ss change in the structure of of the network, But it should be not too difficult. That's definitely beyond the the deadline on on Saturday, So no worries but that's something that we should. We should do in the future.",
            "Yeah. So I don't know if if PERSON1 is able to follow this discussion at least little bit or not at all?",
            "Yeah. I'm trying to understand everything.",
            "It's hard. I II.",
            "Yeah, it's hard to understand now. But I I see you translation model between English and Czech. I don't understand the use of paraphrases are just to improve to translation, Right? Or is transl.",
            "Yeah. So the the idea is that the user is formulating the English input, And they are formulating more versions of that, Because they are not quite happy with the czech output. And the PROJECT6 set up that we always keep talking about is the the user interface, where the people write some English, And and sees the Czech and some guidance which indicated Czech is bad or non. And while as long as the Czech seems bed of the user keeps reformulating the input. So we in the lock files, We have multiple versions of the input, And we are now trying to come up with a network, And set up which can make use of this like rich input the multiple reformulations of the same source, So that we get better output.",
            "Yes I tested PROJECT6 with his English.",
            "And I see it's really interesting. And but now this is a new version. Right. This is English to Czech is. Is it implemented there, or?",
            "It's implemented there, I don't know what's way.",
            "Or maybe in I didn't check whole the options.",
            "So.",
            "You have you have a locked in to to the PROJECT6. Or you just use the?",
            "I I'm sorry, I I'm just server,",
            "Oookay.",
            "Now, the problem but for me it interesting to to to take this see this conversation as as something to undestand what points you guys are. And this.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You you worked with this interface?",
            "Yes,",
            "Yes. Okay, so here you can. No you can't switch you. Yeah, but here is experiment. And yeah this maybe we we haven't told you that you can but you have you have to know. The ID, this is a special ID for me.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then you entered this experiments, This is the actual experiment PROJECT6 two. This you have to read about in the derivarebly derivareble probable probably.",
            "Yes.",
            "You can see the stimulus here. And you have to rephrase the sentence. Or or could you send some more information. Could you send.",
            "So here for example there was a little pause, The typo was. And.",
            "Oh, you you every pause.",
            "Every throw actually.",
            "Okay. okay, yes.",
            "No no no we are not.",
            "Like we changed the was the timeout or or the the or.",
            "Tell its. Say.PERSON8 Okay, okay, there are several event. On the page. For example when the user translation arives. And alignment or arives and but we look the inputs and generally the model not's displayed on on the page. And we we new request like every time to user some dates. Or papers about.",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "Well, yes. You guys have people use in it to or you are you waiting people to use it online. How was it because you you fot in this information, But I was.",
            "Yeah. So we want to start with this experiment using using these interface, But we haven't started yet. People will now what they I was talking about. That I'm working on replacing the translations system that works behind it this system. The English to Czech and Czech to English translation systems. Request them with the with the we calls student models, Which are optimaze to run more quickly. Or or faster on CPUs. Now the egh now I saw the the transitional's quite quite long, Because I I have been waitinglike twenty second after the the fa last change it was done here. With those with those student model it could be like immediate.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we have the student model for the strong system. But here we we we use to systems for Czech one is strong, Where one is weak. And the weak system is just to simulate some lower resource language pair. It has been trained only on five milion sentences. And we already have the students systems for the strong systems that was trained by our partners in ORGANIZATION4. And now I'm struggling with the struggling with training sys student system for the weak system. I have like no experience of training it. And the like so I'm encoutering.",
            "This is much more that expect you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's expected that it will be worse. But not that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And this is the distillation learning.",
            "Yeah. And that that exactly yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's little bit.",
            "That's so like the this fast faster system if like it's speed comes from two factors. One is the distillation part, And the other one si the quantization of. It is normally in in neural translation, You work with floats, And here the floats are contains. So it works even faster on CP use.",
            "Yeah, this part I didn't know. So how.",
            "Yeah, This this is something that we also don't know details about it, Because this this has been done by by ORGANIZATION4 guys. But the general idea is this.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's it works with instead of floats.",
            "Yeah. And and now back to the PROJECT8. The idea is that whatever the user inputs in the first pain, First area that we put together. And than use it together better translation. And the para the experiment so far don't really help, Because the initial experiment showed unemployment. And now the improvement is not there, Because the data set is is a bigger, The data set that PERSON7 has been training it on. So a question is if this is only related the the data size for example, Yeah. PERSON7 could you could you mute yourself, That's. PERSON7, PERSON7 could you mute yourself?",
            "Aa yeah, yeah, Sorry, sorry. So the thanks uhm.PERSON8 Not yet fill.",
            "Yeah, I haven't done it so far. Beacuse I.",
            "Yeah, it's it's difficult.",
            "I cannot find the sorry.",
            "The tap of the call. ¨.",
            "Yeah, I know but.",
            "So the yeah, all.",
            "Sorry.",
            "I have told it so link me here the reverberation.",
            "Okay, I'll exist the. Because I like my computer is free edit.",
            "Yeah, so? Can we does it work now? Can you hear me? Yeah. So the the idea of PROJECT8 is that the multiple variants that the user has entered to the first text area will all contribute. Most of that. Only the last one will be visible. But there is some history of them. And this history would would work jointly with the, With the, with the current inputs to give to give better results. And PERSON7 is not here at the moment. But I think a very relevant experiment is that which tried the exact same set up across various sizes of the training data. So we should see the flipping point,, if it worked with small data sets, And it doesn't work with the big data set, Add what size of the corpus does this change. So PERSON8, if you could. Oh I don't know if PERSON8 is still following. If PERSON8 you could recall this in the in the notes. So it's definitely not manageable before Friday. But we should have like multiple stages multiple corpus sizes, And we should try to find the point where the PROJECT8 with paraphrasing starts to become useless. So maybe it would be useful only for a less resourced language pairs.",
            "Okay.",
            "And that.",
            "I remember you you asked me during the interview about question about this.",
            "Eum-hum.",
            "And that that moment I I said it it would be useful to of the representation, But maybe this is not the case, Because you guys are in right, yeah? And it isn't.",
            "Well. The the is a way in which you can easily put two or fixed number of inputs together, and the the mean of of the representations is,, something which allows you to use any number of input. So that's what I was talking about a while ago during this call. This is the best way to have the same encoder run in multiple times, And then average the the outputs of the encoder. And and decode from this. So that definitely makes sense. So, I don't know, what PERSON7 and PERSON8 ask you to start with as an exercise to join us. But and I don't want to interfere with that. But and one option definitely would be to pick for example the PROJECT2 C plus plus plus code and try to implement this averaging. So the the the same encoder would be run as many times as there is variance of the input sentence. And then the average would be the starting point for the for the decoding, That goes quite badly together with the attention. So one have to be careful, so that you, Because if you be averaging like position wise. Then inserting ward at the beginning would shift everything. And then the word-level representations would be ever reach in in a crazy way. So this is something that one has to like carefully consider how to how to do this aggregation, But this is an interesting exercise on its on its own. Yeah, So I see that we have PERSON7 back. And e s muted at the moment. So I don't know what he was able to follow all. So let me just very quickly say that what I said again, That's PERSON7 it would be good to run these paraphrase this PROJECT8 experiments with increasing corpus sizes, So that we see the flipping point when the PROJECT8 with paraphrases starts to become useless. If it's really useless that the numbers are still not not finished to the 26 and 25.1 that that you are mentioning.",
            "Yeah. Okay. It's a good idea it's just. It's also it will also tell us whether whether the improvement that that we observed for new.",
            "To small one.",
            "It because of the architecture of the how those multiple sources are combine because here in PROJECT2 we have no control under.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How they are combined these. Just implemented there and we use it. And we just know that there are it's shared encoders. So we are using shared encoders they are sharing. And. Yeah, is it good idea.",
            "Sure. So so I'll have to leave the call very soon. But I was curious what is the like test exercise for PERSON1, That you and PERSON8 agreed should to give to PERSON1 for start. Is there is there something specific in decided already or not yet?",
            "Oh, yeah. So, and the.",
            "I canot hear, Yeah, okay.",
            "Listen? Okay? Okay. So it was the PROJECT5 to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the this to show some not actually the user can selects some words that.",
            "Must not appear and must appear here.",
            "Yeah, so and the these it then the doesn't not these the best translation. I I that that was kind of I don't know what you guys have done about this best navigation list. Other than creating the the T and T. And I I I saw thing so check reading about. So the to use quality estimation to rank the the best translation, right? So but the the use of paraphrases are is too confused for me, Because are we providing this paraphrases. But we are not are we in suring that the we will improve the translation. And I use the PROJECT6 a bit just to test. And I don't know if this paraphrases are helping. To parahrases that are are showing and the.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Because I selected one of them. And and these highlighting quality estimation for the for the words when I when I we use one of the just a paraphrases or just changed one word it it got worse more. So I don't know exactly where to start on its. But maybe you to with PERSON8 or PERSON7 I don't know. And try to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I'm'm I'm read everything but I'm confused about it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can start as soon as I work in on this session it better.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So let's so the remark that I had that one possible option for like the next exercise for you. Would be to look at the C plus plus code of PROJECT2. And try to figure out how to put arbitrary number of inputs to this PROJECT8, I suggest to postpone that, And still work on this. First the the list navigation, Here the idea is that people will say, Which words must not appear in the output. And also which words a should appear in the output. And since the user doesn't speak the target language much, Then it is maybe difficult to to insist on some words except for names. So maybe with names, People would like to indicate that they really have to appear there, But it is possible to indicate which words are very bad. If you see in the back translation, that some crazy word appear there, Then you will click on the back translation. And the corresponding word in the target language would get forbidden. So imagine that whatever the some some strange words get translated to to killera in, And you see killer in the in the back translation, So you click killer, And the corresponding Czech word would get prohibited it. So that's that's the idea, And I don't know if the exercise was more on these on just getting the iplementation running or whether it was on the user interface?",
            "We haven't issued any exercise like to to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We just thought PERSON1 to through all all of the things that we haven't done so far.",
            "Just to gets to have some.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Things.",
            "Yeah. That's that's good that we are starting.",
            "It will just the for thought and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To come up, Maybe to to have some own ideas, Because we don't know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON1 to to something that he eventually.",
            "Yeah, so so PERSON1. They the best way to think about this is to to convince yourself that you indeed want to come to LOCATION1, And that you want to whatever find accommodation here. And people here in general don't speak that much English. So you have to communicate with them in Czech, And you don't know Czech so this outbound user outbound translation with its use interface is the best that we can offer to you. And you should look up in the map where you want to stay. And you should ask using the PROJECT6 interface. Or or the navigation, You should post Czech advertisement like I'm a searching for an accommodation in the area of something. And to sent this like p the features of the of the accommodation, And formulate this in Czech, And,, the the machine translation will create some Czech for you. And you have to judge with the existing tools in PROJECT6 whether you like it or not. And the particle toosl that you should be working on the list navigation. Is something which should allow you to to insist on some words appearing in the translation. And insist on some bad words not appearing in the translation. So does it does the assignment in this general terms now make more sense?",
            "Okay, yes. Yes and actually there is there is part of it already implemented, right? Because.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think PERSON7?",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "Yeah, the T and T is, yeah.",
            "The T and T like the it's implemented by PERSON10, So.",
            "Of the -",
            "If he's he's waiting to improve it if if anything in tbackend changed it. And it needs improvement.",
            "Yeah, we everything the way we show all this information.",
            "Yeah. And the other thing is the backend. And currently the backend I just I'm running just the paraphrasing not the translation, Yes so it's paraphrasing from English to to English. And so I'm running the ORGANIZATION5 system which is not the PROJECT2. That we should endup with. And and currently isn't like this constraint decoding is not implemented in PROJECT2 PROJECT2. Our colleague from ORGANIZATION4 he has already implemented something. But it's some in some branch of PROJECT2. I'm but I had no detail like about it. So maybe this is the one thing that it should be if we want this functionality in PROJECT2, It should be somehow implement there. And if.",
            "Okay.",
            "Paper I sent to you the by and netpost.",
            "Yeah, I I read there is.",
            "People constrain decoding.",
            "Yeah, but not the it's the time the just.",
            "About who it it's a it 2018 or 19?",
            "2018.",
            "Okay. So that's the one in the, right?",
            "Yeah, ORGANIZATION5.",
            "ORGANIZATION5.",
            "ORGANIZATION5, yeah. And okay, so I can try to to continue to the called maybe in 9. Or try to.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "To do this, We should somehow coordinates your foresees with in in ORGANIZATION4. Because I know that he was doing on on the already. So he probably has a lot of a lot of stuff implemented. And so maybe there is no need to to much on.",
            "Okay. I do whatever you you you say.",
            "Yeah, so so PERSON7 I didn't know about this this progress onyx side. So if you could just email PERSON6. And ask him what is the status. If there is any support for like constraints in decoding requiring wars. Or forbidding words, And he will tell us what is the status. And if this status is like promising, So if it's nearly finished or or finished. Then PERSON1 should focus on the user interface tied. So how the how the frontend should be improved and to link this frontend to PROJECT2 instead of the ORGANIZATION5. And if there are any gaps on the backend then PERSON1 could look at the at the backend. So PERSON1 like this this list navigation task take it as the whole. The whole is to enable the user, To limit the outputs of an empty system in to a language that the user doesn't speak but to to help the user to make sure that the translation is good in various aspects, And the backend under the hood should be PROJECT2. And you have whatever PERSON6 has created you have that all at your disposal. And then it's it's now up to you to like decide, Where is the once once PERSON6 we get the news from PERSON6 to to decide where is your work most needed.",
            "Okay, yes, okay. But the the interface would it be useful to indicate where the word for example if I the users selected one word to to be in the target language, Would it be useful to to show the user test that the work this that there.",
            "Yes, yeah, I I I think so, so.",
            "Sorry, I don't understand. You mean that if the user select words to not be there?",
            "To, to be there.",
            "To be there, Just tell oh here is your word.",
            "Oh, okay, okay.",
            "Just just.",
            "Yes, it's it's like five minutes for me. So I can.",
            "Something about it. I know. Okay, but oh well I will focus on this and and try.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Trying understand it better. And and as soon as we have an answer I can.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "And now I will try to I I I open so ORGANIZATION5, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I will study better instead the the approach to, Because implemented anything yet. So about it so I I'll try to to get used to this, Okay?",
            "Yeah, yeah. So there is one last thing that I wanted to just the double check with PERSON8 and PERSON7, And that's the regular slot with you. Have have you agree to have they asked you already, Or or not? What would be the ideal time of the day for like regular check-up. This is substitute since your remote a substitute for the daily meeting in the corridor. So normally people meet here, Either they go for coffee after the lunch, or or they meet in they run into each other in the morning, And we have to have some substitute for that for for you. So that would be a regular slot,, and which. Someone would open a call with you. And. You would just say hello. I I I spend the yesterday reading ORGANIZATION5. Or I I had this idea about the user interface improvement for for the the for promi for the required words, And and so on, And it still needs some some for thinking, Or I have this sketch this this like idea how how it could be positioned in the in the user interface, And you would get immediate response. Also if you had any problems, So that you don't stay with an unsolved problem too for too long. So if you are unable to log in to something. If you are unable to start a job on our, Or whatever you would immediately get at least once a day you would have this regular option to to ask for for assistance. Obviously the problem may need more time to be solved, But you would not be alone with that. And that's the key point. So have you agreed on some some slot already?",
            "Not yet we sorry.PERSON8 So so so basically yeah. PERSON1 sent me mail that he is avalaible every day between 12\\. and 13\\. clock central European time, ButI haven't mentioned that the the dealing with things.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.PERSON8 But I I expect that the the these thes, even though they are daily, They they shouldn't take more than ten to.",
            "Ten minutes. Yeah.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Which should be just to completely avoid you being stuck on on some.",
            "Yeah.PERSON8 Is is it to solve problem.",
            "Okay, Have a like a chat window just to, Let say a gmail, I don't know.PERSON8 Oh, yeah. We can we can try to I'm I'm not sure PERSON7 how how does the departments like work, Like can we can we actualy make an internal channel for just the PROJECT1?",
            "There, there is also Zimbra chat. I I switched that off. But if you have not switch that often yours in brows, Then we can even use some some chat within Zimbra.",
            "These keep in mind that I have it's like so.",
            "It's it's so basically the the options are either in Slacks since we should have some licensing or somethings, account. Or I don't know if if you can use WhatsApp, PERSON1? Can can you.",
            "Yeah, sure, we can. ¨ PERSON8 Okay we can we can technically make a group on WhatsApp because I think.",
            "Yeah, I can I don't have. I don't have I had to cancel WhatsApp because people started calling me on WhatsApp so I. Yeah, but but it's like anybody from the team can so pick whatever you like, It's this is this is for the daily chat, It's not for accumulating an in knowledge in there. So whatever system works for you they that that's fine.",
            "Okay.PERSON8.",
            "Yeah, I have the other call so I have to I have to cancel this. So thanks and all.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So, yeah, thanks. And will be in touch later on, And you you well.",
            "Thank you.PERSON8 Bye, bye.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye.PERSON8 So, can you can please stays. Okay. So the thing is yeah the we currently don't have group chat either for for the whole project, or or for just to our university on the project, So so we might consider working on that. It might be helpful. Currently we just we just we can via email. And and via the hte Monday Monday calls, Right?",
            "Yeah, okay.PERSON8 So, I I'll keep your if if thing change.",
            "The problem, just that since I'm not there right? It would be for just to something uhm.PERSON8 Yeah, it's definitely more comfortable then to sends sending emails for for with the single sentence etc, right?",
            "Yeah.PERSON8 Okay, so now i can g we don't need to discuss anything else. To the to the todays meeting. So if you if you wants to, If you if you the once to can can leave. And like I don't know PERSON7 can can you stay stay for moment?",
            "Yeah. I can stay for a moment. PERSON8 Just in case that I that I forget about something. So so basically we have established login credentials for you. So to keep so lets start with. We have we have department Wiki, Which is on the I could say you the link like chat here, So can do you do you know the website fall .cz?",
            "Sorry.PERSON8 Okay.",
            "What is the link? PERSON8 Yeah, Okay, here, so.",
            "Are you sendind this chat? The chat on so-PERSON8 Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to sent you t so so imediately.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 Check it out. Okay, This should be the department web site. But and on the website there is also link to ORGANIZATION1. Did you find it? It should be on top of the website the ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Oh, here is, Yes.PERSON8 So well, there are useful information on the ORGANIZATION1. And some some information it behind a login. So to login into the Wiki the user name the user name is ORGANIZATION3. There si there is a central login for the ORGANIZATION1, You know, Either we don't have personal accounts for the ORGANIZATION1. So the username is ORGANIZATION3. And I don't know PERSON7, Should I should I post into zoom the the password?",
            "PERSON8 I think it should be fine. So basically the we use generic password for this, We call it the small lingvistic password, But it's just the how we call the pass the pass it should password is basically.",
            "You can spell it PERSON8.PERSON8 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm I'm going to spell it. So.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 Password is MALY.",
            "Y and L, okay.PERSON8, yeah, okay MALY then underscore.",
            "Okay. PERSON8 LIN.",
            "Yeah, okay. PERSON8 GVI.",
            "Right.PERSON8 STA.",
            "STA okay. PERSON8 So, so try try to use password at the ORGANIZATION1. And let me know what if works.",
            "Let let me so.PERSON8 Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Thel login is here. Okay. Remember me. Okay. There's a there's something wrong, Okay. ORGANIZATION3 and let we let we check with you.PERSON8 Yes, yeah.",
            "NA.PERSON8 M.",
            "PERSON8 Yes. Like mother.",
            "Oh, okay. So that's was-PERSON8 Okay, so.",
            "Mistake.PERSON8 Yeah, yeah.",
            "Probably. It's the best. Oh here we are. Yeah, that's it. PERSON8 So, yeah. It works? Okay.",
            "Yeah.PERSON8 So remember this one, Because it's also default password for the for the cluster. And and you should definitely change it as soon as you login.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 so will gain. So whimsically to login to our cluster. So yeah, you can you can login to machine.",
            "I'm trying to learn Czech in the middle PERSON8 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so so it.",
            "PERSON8 So I send you send you machine yeah.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 The the what is it call? Postname of the of the machine you should log in to if you want to excess the computational resources.",
            "Okay. PERSON8 I need to find what is the what is your username, It should be somewhere just - Okay, so so the login your username should be simply.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 You you're your your surname without diacritics.",
            "Sorry? PERSON8 Well the your username for the cluster is your surname. Without diacritics those.",
            "Okay. Perfect.PERSON8 So also you are.",
            "So the the password is same, right? PERSON8 Yes, yes.",
            "Yes, right. PERSON8 Any any any you should you should change it immediately with the password utility. You you know that. Right?",
            "Okay.",
            "So maybe try a login there now if to know whether it works.PERSON8 Yes. Definitelly.",
            "Okay. As a sagePERSON8 Yes.",
            "Just a minute. It seems correct. Let see. Password. Yeah, it worked. PERSON8 Okay, so. So this is just the, You you don't actually. Oh, you can actually submit the tasks from this machine. But you should not do any resource intensive here, Because this machine is.",
            "I I think this cannot even submit things from this note.PERSON8 Oh, so it's the same as LRC, right? Okay, so so.",
            "It's not like LRC, From LRC you can submit. But this is this one I think the doesn't work from here. Never never mind. Always just don't use this machine the computings.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "In its excess to different machines, Which are used to to quie quie our jobs, Or to do some computation.",
            "Yeah, okay. Oh, oh I don't have access to them already, Right so.",
            "And everything it's written on the ORGANIZATION1, sorry on the ORGANIZATION1 page.",
            "Okay. Okay.PERSON8 Yeah, link there are definitely some restrictions like, You know, you don't you don't you cannot access everything on the file system. But, yeah you will just regular user. You are in the PROJECT3 group. And and you know. You should everything should be available. What what is supposed to be available. So lets lets just move on to to the another accounts, I will send you more details about the cluster. And this some basic tutorial via the email. Because I just don't want to write every single you are into the chat. Right? And we can we can check I can check with you tommorow. Like a what what the had we read so far. Don't don't worry about it.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 But I send send in the chat. I posted the your your so department email adress. To access it you have to get to Zimbra. Which is basically I will sent you the.",
            "Zimbra.PERSON8 Yes,. Just a moment. I think this should be adress.",
            "Okay. PERSON8 So again, again, you should have the default password. And you should probably change it in site Zimbra. But the thing is that the password is link the account on the cluster. And account on Zimbra it's different. So just keep that in mind.",
            "Okay.PERSON8 Doesn't matter if you have the same. Or different password. But just remember them.",
            "Just checked, If I can. Password to is no longer valid. Okay. It it to to change password, okay. I will to this I'm-PERSON8 So I.",

            "The acces in the email. Sorry.PERSON8 Okay.",
            "I will just change it so I can confirmed. This one, okay. Let see if it's okay. Oh something's wrong. Okay, so there is a there is some rules, So-PERSON8 Oh yeah, That's the that's the definitely why I do have different passwords for for those things, Because.",
            "Yeah.PERSON8 One is more more.",
            "Okay. I think it's it's sorry. Email is already. Here we are. Okay, I I have access to the email. I have access to the-PERSON8 Okay.",
            "The clus the cluster.PERSON8 Yeah, so so that's that's good. PERSON7, Is there anything else that needs to be accessible to PERSON1?",
            "Yeah, email, cluster, Or or the network. And PERSON8. Yeah, okay, So so as.",
            "Wiki page I think is enough.PERSON8 Yeah, I think I think this this should be fine. And if we run into something you can you can let us know. And we we solve solve it, Right? But you know. I think this this should be definitely everything you need right now. So okay. So I will send you we have basically introduction page on the ORGANIZATION1, I will send you link to that. And possibly to sublink for the CPU and GPU cluster use it, But that's basically summarize on the introduction page, So the fine. And I guess for at least for today we should just go fot that maybe try the the basic use it tutorial just the submit some hello word on the cluster. Yeah to get some basic idea. And maybe tomorrow we can talk about it in more detail if if necessary.",
            "Okay, okay. So I'm today I'm going to check this. And tomorrow we talk. PERSON8 So just one last thing. I I need to mark down is what was what is the current plan for for you, Like what what you should be working on? I'm not sure. Like currently you're you're trying to make the ORGANIZATION5 work, right? And and try to constraints according their? Am I right?",
            "Yes. Yeah and and actually it I'm also trying to think about the the user interface, right? PERSON8 Okay.",
            "Am I?",
            "So so so during the call lake previous stages of this call, We have already so I have task to ask status of of constrain decoding in PROJECT2. And based on his like information we will find or we will will know better what what whether you should work more on the backend. Or on frontend.PERSON8.",
            "We I don't think so we should continue the ORGANIZATION5 thing, We-PERSON8 I I do agree with him, but.",
            "To PROJECT2. And we should abandoned ORGANIZATION5. PERSON8 Yeah, I'm not sure for do you have any personal experience with C plus plus by any chance?",
            "It's little experience. But I will I will practice this from now. Because you guys use this PROJECT2 toolkit, right? And not to-PERSON8 Well yeh, We will use it, But more form the users so the basically take the functionality. '' 'just run it with our data setup and experimenting in certain way. And so that's that's why PERSON7 is going to ask where people from from ORGANIZATION4 whether they already implemented the constraint decoding, Otherwise someone has to implement it. And I don't I'm not sure whether that's that's the best use of your time to make you implemented. Since you don't have that much experience, Like there might be other approaches, Like you can an empty frame work and wau that's why we were trying the ORGANIZATION5. Because that already supports the functionality, right? But if you if you prefer something elsey. You can try different, For example and empty frame working. And implement functionality it should be easier than with PROJECT2. And try run the experiments there, And then later we can conslut based on the results whether we it to the PROJECT2 and ask the ORGANIZATION4 people to actually to the integration.",
            "Okay. Yeah.PERSON8 Yeah, yeah, don't. Yeah, okay?",
            "No, I can I can see if the it would be to difficult for me. Because uhmuhm I know see but I never C plus plus using we oriented to. But but I can try before definding before this to PERSON8 Okay, okay. I I will I I took a note and and based on the responce from ORGANIZATION4 we will decide how to how to move on from here. Maybe if if there's still implementing it we can you can early help them out. Or you know it depence how how much work is it in such and and you know. Can be a combined effort. So so we don't have to implemented just by yourself, They can help you with the the support like it, If you run to some trouble in such. So if if you if you willing to do it, Wau that awsome. Might be an option.",
            "I I don't know actually I'm I'm trying to find something that to help you. And-PERSON8.",
            "Because I don't know the the deadline is-PERSON8 So so, Okay. So so to fill you in, Basically we had the 18 month review two weeks ago. And it was fine.",
            "Yes.

            "He was there. OK. That's the user.",
            "I can hear you. Yes. I can hear you.",
            "In ORGANIZATION2 you can, you can change your name for every single session. So it's somewhere, when you click on yourself in the list of participants, or something like. Right-click yourself, then you can change your name. And also you were black, so we saw you as, as, black on black and that's why -",
            "I get this, it's better like this. No problem.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, my ideal,, view is that these meetings will run even without me, so so feel free to just discuss. And,, today,, the,, goals - Is that,, yea that's to divide the work among ourselves, so that less synchronization is necessary. Is that the right meeting right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah,, so. One piece of news that I have is that we have some extra funding,, which would be good to be spent before the end of the year. So if we come up quickly with what we want from human annotators, then it, we can, like easily fund those. And that would be good for either getting more,, meeting minutes,, or, adding one more, like a third,, summary of some meetings, and that could be usable if we wanted to compare different humans against each other with a respect to,, third, reference summary. And,, also, we could use these annotators for the manual evaluation of meetings. So,, that is something that we need to,, play around with, so that we have a good understanding of what people evaluate and how,, and,, maybe use it directly for the development of some automatic evaluation measure, such as,, like fine-tuning it or evaluating, the evaluation measure compared to the human performance,, and all that. So the, the little issue here is that, - Obviously PERSON2 can supervise the, the annotation work,,, for whatever we,, like decide,, PERSON2 can be in touch with the annotators, and, and, distribute tasks to them. But one piece of software is not quite finished. Actually, it is in a good shape, but,, the distribution of files is not yet finished. And it's just an administrative decision,, it's not too hard. And there's the annotation interface by PERSON1. And PERSON1 will be quite busy with other things,, outside of, of,, the project, till the end of September. So that's why I would like to ask probably, to,, get acquainted,, with the tool that PERSON1 was developing and is still developing it's something Python based and,, if could,, like finalize it for the purposes of this annotation, so that in October and the latest November we can gather some, manual scorings of meetings.",
            "I have shared the document in agenda. You can now see the link to the document, installation details and annotation guides for this new tool. And,, I can, oh,. So so now we should,,, make, make some technical decision. So we kind of decided to use Github for storing the files that annotators will, -",
            "Produce.",
            "Produce.",
            "And that they will directly download the big files. So the big files, like the sounds, they won't be in Github.",
            "So that the situation is such that annotator should download the audio or video file, which could be very up to 2 gigas. And then he had, he has some small files that can be distributed by any but not open,, tool, not publicly open, because these are meetings. So they should download the files,, make the connection, make the alignment within this installable,, tool,, on their computer and then put them back somewhere, this small files. Not this big files. So this is some, there should be some technology with Github,, completed, so we need some technical,, help and if would be so kind to help us with this we would be very helpful.",
            "Yeah, right, so is that,, is that clear? So pleased to have a look at the instructions. How to install the annotation interface. I think you have seen it in one of the screenshots, but I don't know whether you have already,, tried that.",
            "This is the document here.",
            "Yea.",
            "There's a lot of screenshots.",
            "Yea, yea. So, so, try installing it and, let's plan that in the coming 2 weeks. You will modify it as needed so that we can actually do the, the first rounds, first attempts of, of, annotation. And I think that that you should now focus on the,, on the implementation things. And PERSON8 would probably be the, the right person to, like propose,, how to then aggregate the alignment. So,, in, this is, this is like the first attempt to develop the manual evaluation method. The underlying tool,, is a guidance for the final score. And,, the exact formula how the final score is to be,, calculated, it's up to us. So it's up to PERSON8, to come up with some -",
            "Actually PERSON3 has come -",
            "And PERSON3 -",
            "Some proposition of the evaluation protocol.",
            "Yea that's right.",
            "And there should we discuss some details.",
            "Yes. Yes. So this is PERSON3,, the idea that I'm having - I'm sorry I haven't read the, the, human evaluation protocol for minuting yet.",
            "I haven't finished it yet, so no problem.",
            "The idea that I have in mind is that annotators will manually align, the items from the different meeting minutes. And then based on this alignment,, there would be,, some automatic calculation which will indicate like how much of the documents, how much of the summary is actually not aligned at all. And the part which is aligned, to what extent does it overlap. And there would be some automatic measure. It could be some simple string similarity, or some clever deep,, deep neural,, similarity, or we could use some of the Shell,, the tools. So, this is my basic,, basic idea that can be and must be refined in, in many ways.",
            "Are you talking about human evaluation, or annotation? Because they are different things, like, what do you mean by alignment?",
            "Yes. So, so in order to,, to achieve human evaluation, I think that the humans should be annotating, like linking the various summaries to each other. And then the, the manual score would be an aggregation over this annotation. So -",
            "It's pointless. If they change, if they modify something, then, then it's pointless. They shouldn't be evaluating at all. Like what you are talking about -",
            "So there is. So there is 2 alignment. So PERSON1's tool is now,, designed and primarily planned for the alignment between the transcript and the minutes. The, the way I,, see it would be that - Yes, this would be done and here people would be changing things as well. So this is the first stage of annotations so to say. And then, the same tool, but modified would be used for people to align,, summary to summary. Technically this very,, similar,, user interface. It's just that in the,, in the window,, on the left and right window you see,, a summary instead of transcript. And this is like the annotation in the evaluation phase. And this, the result of this - Here, they should not be modifying the texts any,, anymore. They should be just linking things together, and,, possibly if they find something really bad they could like indicate that this references is wrong or,, things like that. That would be possible. But not changing the, the content. And based on the alignment,, some automatic calculation would aggregate it to give us a score.",
            "You are talking about something very different from what I have in mind so I don't really know, what is alignment and what the hell is it for. I'm talking about human evaluation, which means using besides rule scores also expert's scores. And the experts have no right to change anything when they evaluate. So I'm talking about something different.",
            "You are talking about your approach to this second,, phase, -",
            "I'm talking about the, the fact that the automatic evaluation is not credible enough.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "And it must be augmented with human evaluation.",
            "Yes. I totally agree.",
            "Human evaluation, the humans are the experts, will check the candidate summary produced by a model against reference summary that is produced by humans. They will not modify anything, they will not align, or do anything.",
            "Yes, I absolutely agree.",
            "They will put some scores that I'm defining now.",
            "Yea, so this course -",
            "Beside the rule score we will also have this scores -",
            "Yes.",
            "More about the quality of that automatic minuting.",
            "Yea. The question is,, I totally agree with you, absolutely and I'm like one step further already. I'm asking how do they assign scores and specifically to which, to which units do they assigned the scores? And I suggest that,, first the units have to be kind of identified and these units will be identified by aligning, by manually indicating which of the items in the reference summary matched which items in the candidate summary. And then,, a, actually one option would be to ask them for each of these alignment links. This is like item one were the summary, the reference summary said,, they discussed the connection for the next,, session. And the,, the candidate summary would say: \"ORGANIZATION2 vs. ORGANIZATION3 Meet, were, were considered\". This alignment link could be then labelled with a number. The number would be either coming from the annotators, like,, do these strings represent the same thing and humans would probably say \"yes, they are the same thing\" for,, but we could also automate it, and, as some string matching techniques. And these would probably fail, because they would,, not realize that,, the,, the, the platform for the meeting and ORGANIZATION2 vs. ORGANIZATION3 Meet are 2 different vocabularies. Like, so the, the, the identity would not be recognized by automatic measures. But I, I think that the critical element in the manual evaluation is the units, of, over which we are aggregating. And I haven't read the details of your proposal. Maybe you are proposing to say that the meeting as a whole is one unit, and that people are assigning some score to this meeting as a whole. And I think that -",
            "Not the meeting, it's the minutes. It's the tran. Summary.",
            "Yea, the summary, yea. But, if the summary, if the whole summary is a single unit then, it's,, like a very costly number to get. People will, the annotators, human evaluators will spend 10 minutes reading the document and then -",
            "No that would be not. It's just 5 sentences average.",
            "5 sentences on average?",
            "Yes.",
            "Do we have,, these shorts summaries?",
            "Absolutely.",
            "5 sentences, but we have short summaries.",
            "We have short, we have short summaries.",
            "We have different summaries including -",
            "They will write the, a candidate of 5 sentences against the candidate reference of 5 sentences. I will just put some numbers there.",
            "But if, if it's just the reference and if people are no longer considering the transcript. So the question. The main question -",
            "They shouldn't be considering transcript, they will evaluate only the minutes. The candidate minute against the reference minute. So forget about transcript. It's a different thing what you're saying. Segmentation. Alignment. That's completely different thing.",
            "No, no, it's not. You're, you're still not understanding what I'm saying. It's,, I'm proposing that we will be doing the evaluation of summaries at a finer scale than you are proposing. You are working from the assumption that the summaries are 5 sentences long. In which case, I agree. Let's assign just one number to 5 sentences. That's, that's all.",
            "OK.",
            "If the summaries were longer and the summers that I saw so far in, like in the meetings that I had, these were very long. It was like 2 pages. With 2 pages, -",
            "2 pages of summary? And what's the transcript length?",
            "An hour long meeting, so, how much, how many words is that? That's very long.",
            "Almost 10 pages I guess.",
            "Yea, possibly. Yea.",
            "So even, even when we will be organising the shared task we possibly won't be giving them,, very short minute for making the system. So any knowledge evaluate that, probably we will have to consider the wide scope of minute. Like it should be,, applicable the manual evaluation we make. It has to be applicable to longer minutes as well.",
            "Yeah, I think so. So,, I, -",
            "It will just take more time.",
            "No. Well, if there is one problem it's - If you think it will just take more time to read the 2 page summary and compare it to the 2 page reference summary,, not just,, more time. Is the problem that you are gathering too few numbers, and then your statistics over the whole set of submissions is too sparse to - You have too few numbers and when you are taking the average of two few numbers the statistics are not reliable. So that's why you need,, finer units so you get more,, more numbers. It's the same with machine translation evaluation that we run every year for PROJECT1. There essentially we want to know which of, what is the overall ordering of the systems. But we are not evaluating it at the level of systems. We are evaluating at the level of segment and there we are aggregating to see the level of the systems. And here, I think, we need to do the same. Need to evaluate at the level of individual items in the summary and then aggregate it over all the items in the,, summary to see how overall it, it worked for a particular meeting. So it's,, I agree that if our meetings - This is, this is a critical,, consideration. So, there, there is more ways to go. One way to go is to preserve the, the current length of meetings and their summaries, which could be up to a one hour meeting and, 2 page, summary, roughly. And then we have to,, do,, have to develop a fine grade manual evaluation method that works on the individual segments. Or we could forcefully split the meetings into like, parts and make sure that parts are,, when summarized, are not more than five sentences. And in that case, it would be possible to,, to go with, your proposal PERSON3 and ask people to evaluate the whole thing. The whole thing now would be only five sentences.",
            "I have already done this. The segmentation part. The segmentation is finalised. I can do it, we can do it automatically. Like we can run my scripts and split the 2 page summaries you are talking about. We can split that maybe in 3, 4 or 5 parts.",
            "And have you, have you applied it to the collection that PERSON2 has? The project meetings?",
            "No, no.",
            "Yea, so let's, let's give it a try. So this is definitely something that makes sense. So if you could talk to PERSON2 and -",
            "Yes, I was tracking in the classer about data, but it's very messy. I cannot really identify the, I would be really glad to have this data, the English version of course, only the English parts. In some text files or somewhere.",
            "Yes, yea. So this is -",
            "Yes if I, yes. And then I will try my scripts to see how make work. But the segmentation about splitting them in the, from the topical point of view.",
            "Yea. I, I don't, I would not expect that you would understand the layout of the data without talking to PERSON2. So please talk to her and,, agree on whatever,, file format conversion is,, is needed so that you can run the scripts there. What needs to be done is that someone, PERSON2 or possibly PERSON8 should validate whether the segmentation makes sense. Because we are like critically changing the units, of, for our shared tasks.",
            "PERSON3's segmentation of our data.",
            "Yes. PERSON2 is taking off. This is, this is useful. So that's one option. Use your segmentation script on this data and if the outputs are kind of okay then yes that's a good option and we should manually revise these segments, and we have time for that so we could move to like short segments summaries. So the transcript would need, would obviously be, also have to be split into these smaller chucks. And that is, that is fine like it's, it's, it's a simplified definition of the, of the shared task. If you run into a problem that the segmentation, the initial one, is -",
            "But the shared task is a different story. Why you are mentioning the shared task?",
            "Because we are developing this evaluation measure for the purposes of the shared task.",
            "That's, that's another big problem. That, that's fine. This is solution because, you know going, launching a shared task and then having manual evaluation raises very, very -",
            "That's okay.",
            "Very big problems. Because it's a competition so.",
            "Well yes so there's, there is two ways of looking at shared tasks. One way is is this competition thing where you want to know the winner. And in PROJECT1 this was never the case. In PROJECT1 it was always what I call the friendly competition. So it was like that everybody tries to do the solution and describe what they did. And yes there is some evaluation measure at the end. But we are always highlighting the, the collaboration in the fight against the nature so to say. So everybody's trying to, to put the best into that system, but the winner is no, like never celebrated. The, the tables where the results were always shown and, and like quickly browsed over and we do not give any prizes for that. So they, it's,, it's more like, take part, show that you are good. But we are not differentiating who is the main winner. And there, the benefit of this optics of this like understanding of the shared task is that while we have to do the evaluation as good as we can it is no longer so sensitive in the, in like the social aspect so to say. Everybody agrees that the evaluation is hard. Everybody understands that the scores, manual as well automatic, are unreliable and being a winner does not mean much. It's, it's more like whether you are among the better ones or the worse ones. And, and that's it. And even the worst systems can be very good in, in some particular aspects. So I would like to, to highlight this shared view of this, of this friendliness of the competition in our, tasks. And I think it is inevitable, because, I agree with you that it would create tension if we were saying like: \"This is the winner!\" And if we go for anyone auto.",
            "You can also anonymize the, you can also anonymize the submissions like that.",
            "Yes, we can also anonymize the submissions at the -",
            "Evaluation of the submissions can also be blind.",
            "For, for the evaluation this definitely has to be blind. The annotators mustn't know who is submitting what. That's, that's for sure. But even after the results are there like everybody could get table which lists him, their submission among all anonymous. So only if people all went together and they would all match these tables they would, based on the scores, they would be able to recover the, the overall scoring. That is, that is an option. I would simply trust,, that people will understand what is the task about. It's about trying to solve it and not trying to beat the others. If, if we, were highlighting the, the competition aspect that the the winner aspect then I agree with you that going for something automatic is less prone to like,, less prone to, to,, it's less inviting for some questions like, it's more trustworthy in a sense because it's evaluated by machine. But that the same time it is much more prone to errors in the design of this evaluation measure. And this evaluation measure could by accident promote some strange aspects. And also, if people knew the evaluation measure they could very easily over fit to that. And we don't want the best system, which performs, the the system which performs best in our version of. We want the best system which, the system which delivers the best summaries. So that, that's difference. We, we don't want people to focus too much on the evaluation measure. We want them to focus on the task of developing a good summary. And we are designing the evaluation measure on the go, at the same time, while we are designing the the systems that do the task.",
            "Sure it makes sense.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so, so from the practical point of view let's test the hypothesis that we could run it with just a chunks of meetings and corresponding chunks of minutes. So that is for PERSON3 and PERSON2 to discuss the, like where the files are and how to run it and then for PERSON2, PERSON8 or to evaluate whether the chunks still make sense. If this works good then there would be a lot of annotation effort to like double check this, to apply to all the meetings and and create the, the shared task data from this. If this this test doesn't work that well then we need to like set the task again and move to find great evaluation of long -",
            "But you will definitely need people to do the alignments. You will need people to do the alignment.",
            "Yes!",
            "Yes!",
            "Actually check the alignment because the automatic method will split the transcript and will also split the summary and you need people to checking these splits match to, to make the correct -",
            "Yes exactly! This is what I was saying. So if, so please do this for 1 or 2 meetings now. PERSON2 and PERSON8 will test whether it make sense. And if it makes sense if we go in this direction then yes, we count on doing this revision of all the minutes splits during the autumn. Yeah.",
            "What's the size of the data? What is the size of the dataset? The current data.",
            "60 hours in English.",
            "Dataset -",
            "Number of samples please.",
            "You have a tables in many places -",
            "80, 82 hundred -",
            "Hours of English and 55 hours of Czech data.",
            "So we don't know how many samples are there?",
            "Yes I know it's the in the table and you have, you have access to this table I can share you the link again.",
            "So, I, I also did some splitting of the dataset. But probably, I think PERSON3 would be having a better version of it, because I'm just a big nerd to it, so we will see that if,, because I think PERSON2 has already seen the version of my splitting of this dataset which we have. So I think PERSON3 will be having a better version. So maybe we will apply that one.",
            "By the way, PERSON8, your voice quality is much better now. And the mic, so.",
            "It's thanks to you. You did figure it out, so I did, I got helped myself to this.",
            "Okay so, so I think this, this probe. This test with PERSON3's approach is ready. Just please do it. And let's discuss maybe next, next week same time. Whether it worked or not right. And in the meantime PERSON8 so, so the question is whether someone should already explore the alignment approach if we have to go for the longer minutes and longer, longer meetings.",
            "So alignment approach we need some automatic thing for it, or we are going to do it manually right?",
            "Let's, let's, so the, I think the, the best,, description of the general idea is if you would look up the age. I'll type it into the chat.",
            "So I guess it is like about 80 samples if I'm right. 81 or 82 samples.",
            "So I'm, I'm sharing, if only the, yeah. Age is one of the authors. That is an evaluation measure that is attempted for machine translation. It was following the individual sentences. And I'm not saying, maybe you have heard about it.",
            "Yes, I have, yes, I have.",
            "But I'm. I'm not saying that we should like use anything from this particular method. I'm just. It would be good -",
            "Just to refer.",
            "Initial page, initial papers. And the idea is that first people were aligning parts of this - First people are labelling what are important parts of the sentence, so they were labeling, or labelling. So they were indicating, what is the, the event, description and what are the individual participants. So these were the units. Goal was to evaluate which of the translations is better. And these were translations of individual sentences. So it is the evaluation of individual sentences. First people annotate what are the units, there. They do this labelling of units in the reference, and they do this labelling in the candidate. And then they have this second phase of annotation where they align the elements, the unit they identified in the reference and in the candidate. And then there is the automatic formula which evaluates how many units were matched at all. And when they were matched, to what extent they, the lexical coverage, the wording of these units was identical. And this is exactly what i would propose for the, for our case, except obviously here the big thing that we are evaluating is the summary, the minute and we have candidates minutes and reference minutes. We first have the individual items there. That could be just the lines of the, of the minutes. These could b. Like we could skip the first stage of annotation and assume that individual lines are the relevant units, but we should not skip, the alignment phase in which we indicate which items correspond which in the minutes. And then the third phase would be to aggregate the alignment into a number. And the number would tell us how well the particular candidate matches the reference.",
            "And maybe it could be also important to make more variance of the minutes. So this is the question I would like to discuss with you. If I should generate for some texts more variance of minutes, because, and more alignments for this of, more, that more people make the same alignment that could also have evaluating the minutes. If you just make it once, so, I, I think, I would, I should think further about it.",
            "Yea.",
            "But it could possibly have a big improvement of how many people annotate the same, the same alignment more times.",
            "Yea. Then they.",
            "If it is, if it is just once empty it's, it's. It's, just it can, it maybe -",
            "It's like, it's like multiple,, reference translations and their effects.",
            "I think we should develop multiple.",
            "Yea. The, the stability of, of the evaluation increases if you have more people doing the judgments, because everyone will miss and oversee different aspects and if you union all the observations you are again increasing the denominator. So in, in short, you, you want to do statistics with as big numbers as you can get. You,, so you, you want to have many observations all of a smaller scale and then aggregate.",
            "Yes. And when we have several minutes for the same transcript and if we annotate, if we align one transcript with one variant of minutes and one transcript with another variant of minutes we see how much of transcript is covered by minutes.",
            "So it could also,, kind of,, play to estimate the minutes. So if minutes reflect more pieces of transcript they could be better than those that just cover some of them.",
            "Yea, yea. So here we are coming to a very important question whether we want to base our manual evaluation of summaries on the comparison with the reference minute. And we said \"yes\". Or whether we want to base it on the,, link to the original transcript.",
            "Yes this is important.",
            "And if we, if we are not so sure about our summaries, the manual ones. We definitely need to go for the evaluation against the transcript. So, I don't really know. So.",
            "I'm not really sure about the quality of manual minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So what I sometimes you, you, according to what a read about manual evaluation of text, you would estimate it as quite high. So you would give them quite a high score. So they have good readability, good understandability so they -",
            "But they do not cover, don't cover.",
            "But they don't cover important points from point of view of essence of the meeting.",
            "Yea.",
            "Probable issue is so it could be better to cover important minutes. Important points of the minutes, of the whole meeting, then to make it grammatically perfect. So this is also to decide if we take in account something more than just grammatically grama.",
            "Coverage. I think coverage will be the exact term we can use for that.",
            "Yes. That's why i thought about coverage. I thought about the coverage.",
            "So in that case the alignment tool by PERSON1 is exactly what we want then. Because every candidate minute would be simply aligned. Obviously the tool now allows also for fixing errors in transcript and fixing errors in the, in the candidate summary, but we would prohibit this for the purposes of evaluation we would say \"only find the relevant part in the transcript\". The transcript is good because it's solid. Like it's given there. What we trust it. There is, once it, it goes through the, this revision when doing the other, the reference summaries. It is perfected, like we can, we know where the word starts and end and so on. So we can measure the, the quality of the summary by observing something on the transcript. And the transcript is common to all the candidates. So the number of units is comparable across all the submissions. And that is also very, very important. So that we would simply measure the, the precision and recall of important facts from the transcript. And what are the important facts from the transcript. Well. These are those facts that were highlighted by humans doing the reference summaries. So that's the, the idea is that I think without looking at, at the data any, any further. I think that it is more reliable, to base the evaluation on the transcripts and relation of the summary to the transcript. Then on a relating the,,, the minutes to each other. And then also like if you have 2 reference summaries and 3 reference summaries. Then suddenly your evaluation of the candidates' summary would change. If you have,, if you relate the candidate summary to the reference you can easily change the score by adding more reference summaries, but you don't have to re-annotate anything. So the idea is that you create like stand of annotation and making standing of the transcript and not of, not of the summaries. Yea.",
            "So, yes, so I think like, it's, it's makes sense when we do the manual evaluation with respect to the transcript and the summary. Also from a practical point of view that we need to finalize our dataset by December. So, like there is a whole lot of annotation work to be done. So I think, from like, from the, it makes sense that we do transcript to summary best evaluation, manual evaluation. At the same time keeping in mind that we are approaching for our deadline. So I think that would be like physical. Maybe we can try with the minuting like comparing the summary with the candidate but maybe that should, can follow for our next shared task in some other venue. But if we, yea, from the practical point of view I think annotation should start like right now.",
            "Okay, so we have to summarize what we discussed so far. We can try making the units smaller. So we can try segmenting our dataset into such units so that the summary is 5 sentences at most. If this succeeds, yes, let's proceed with this like chopped dataset. If we fail we will have to rely more on the, on the alignment. But we have kind of agreed that it's good to base the evaluation on the relation between the candidate and the transcript and use the reference as one competing candidate and also use the references to indicate what are the important pieces of information that deserve coverage so to say.",
            "Yes. There is one more detail about short summaries that we have in our data. That your very good.",
            "Yea, okay.",
            "So really those shortest summaries are, when aligned I expect that the alignment would be very complicated. Because they are very general. So they are kind of, taken from the context.",
            "But they, they that the short summaries are like generalizing too much. It's not, the short summaries that PERSON3's script would create. PERSON3's script breaks longer minutes, longer transcript into shorter ones. But the level of detail is, is preserved. Whereas here in the summaries that you are talking about, the whole transcript corresponds to some short summary. So there is a lot of generalization happening. That's, that's a different situation.",
            "Yes, so, but they, they are complication based.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so, so we have discussed something which is very important. Now let's use the remaining fifteen minutes. We, you can discuss more but I have another meeting at, at 4. To, to check that everybody knows what they should be working on in the coming seven days, for example or. So PERSON3 should get in touch with PERSON2 and split the dataset. PERSON4, how much time do you have in the coming days? Would you, would you have capacity to help with,, the segmentation of,, of the meetings for example.",
            "Manual segmentation you mean or?",
            "Seeing what script does, so it's more like formatting and, and running the script by. Or PERSON3 could do this on his own. I don't know. I'm just, like -",
            "Yea I have time. You can just assign me anything you want.",
            "Okay, yeah. So PERSON3 when, yes, PERSON3 when doing this split of PERSON2's dataset using your script feel free to ask PERSON4 for, for any help, that we have this -",
            "At, at this point I think it is not really necessary, I mean.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "If you are using people to create the data you should just change a little bit the way they do it. You just ask people to split up the long meetings transmitting transcripts into 2 or 3 times and that's it. So it is something that should happen since the data I created. I think. It doesn't make sense to do it later automatically and then ask other people to check if it's good quality or not. Is it something you should introduce in the first place when you create the data. If you have long meetings and then in the, when you, when you create the, the, the summaries, you ask people to create the alignments, you just tell them to, to, to avoid having short, having very long meetings I think. It's much better to do it that way. Just split up the, the, the, the transcript, the long transcript manually. But since you do it manually. And then we will have reasonable transcript.",
            "Yea I agree that in principle this would be good. But in my impression many of the meetings didn't quite follow the,, the agenda. And they were jumping to the first topic of the agenda throughout the meetings for example. So that, the same first item in the summary then is mentioned a few times at the. Beginning, in the middle and at the end of the transcript. So dividing this transcript then doesn't make sense. So this is my worry. That you cannot really split the data, because, the -",
            "If you cannot do it in, in the beginning then it's much worse to do it later.",
            "But, but doing it, in the beginning is inappropriate, because people are referring to,, to things like there and back again. I don't think it's the, I think it's quite often the case that this division would not be possible, or would be, would be distorting the data too much.",
            "So as ours today -",
            "Yea, for example, yea.",
            "Began from the middle.",
            "Yea, yea. That's my fault. So, and since I'm, I'm.",
            "It happens. It's just -",
            "It happens. It just happens that people start at begi like in the middle and then they go back to the,.",
            "But one more case I would like to highlight that when I was, just experimenting with this dataset which we have collected. So the ones which we have for, like the one which PERSON2 did share with me. That was an example of a short minute. And that meeting was short because that was actually,, shifted to some other like, like from ORGANIZATION3 Meet to Sky Import, or like maybe there was shift of time. So that was, that's why that was a short meeting, or short minute created. So probably, I think the ones which are very short minutes, that will be,, not containing much of the, like minuting data, which is relevant.",
            "Yep.",
            "We have a couple but really few.",
            "Really few, yeah.",
            "Yea, that, that's one case that I just came to.",
            "I think i have chosen the shortest for you, because you asked for it.",
            "Yea so that was one case I did see.",
            "Okay, so back, back to the, to the people's assignments. So PERSON3 will try to split the meetings that PERSON2 would provide. PERSON8 should then check if these splits make sense, or where are the problem?",
            "I will, I, I just want to, to see the data first because I don't think that most of them are long. So I will just gather some statistics from the data and see, but. I'm sceptical if we are doing it later. i would really strongly suggest doing it in the beginning when the data are created.",
            "Yea.",
            "I really suggest, that one, that people who create the data should just create shorter samples, not that long, 2 pages summaries, 10 page transcripts and 2 page summaries. They just create, divide them to-topically and create shorter version.",
            "We could ask people to do -",
            "That is definitely more clear, definitely very clean practice. It's much more cleaner than doing it, then automatically with script and asking other people to check them again. It's a total disaster. So i strongly suggest that you, you, you do it like that.",
            "Yes. So I, I agree.",
            "I will check the data. I will see what.",
            "Yeah. I agree that we should probably add this instruction that people should, add like a horizontal rule, like, dividing line when they can. When there is is like a clear change in the topics and there is no -",
            "In minutes.",
            "In both, transcript and minutes.",
            "In both, transcript and minutes the same lines.",
            "The same lines yes.",
            "Good. End of part, part -",
            "Yes, absolutely.",
            "Yea. This segmentation -",
            "Could be down with new data.",
            "Could be, exactly. So please add these to the instructions. And and possibly we can recreate -",
            "How long time, how long duration audio -",
            "The, the is like 5 lines in the summary. Let's say 5 items in the summary.",
            "Oh, well, for the annotators this is not state instruction because they have different lengths of summary. Somebody has just 5 lines of summary, for their -",
            "They will have to split the transcript. And then summary follows the transcript, topically. So that they, they break the 10 pages into 3 or 4 parts, 2 pages each. And then the summary will be broken at the same way. Just they will align the summary sentences, they will put them in the right, they will match them in the right parts.",
            "Yea, let's, let's try that, yea. Okay.",
            "It's, the, the, the the cleanest way to do it. Otherwise it will be, it will, it will mess up the process and everything.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I, what I may do now -",
            "My battery is dying. I have to. I'm sorry I have to go. I'm home so I'm coming. It's just my battery is dying.",
            "Yea ok. Yea so thank you and, like, talk to you, one you are here. So in the meantime, or just finish what, what you want to say.",
            "No, no I could, ok. But it would match to PERSON3 actually.",
            "Okay, yeah. So,, in the meantime I would like to ask to try the tool by PERSON1. And kind of finalize it so that we can use this tool, and proceed with the,, meeting, with the summary evaluation which will be based on the alignment. So I'm a little bit sceptical towards the idea of, of splitting the meetings. So let's explore both. PERSON3 will be exploring the idea of dividing it and were,, proceed with the alignment and,, PERSON8 in link with can think about the evaluation measure. From PERSON3, from PERSON3's style of evaluation we would get one number. One,, indicating the number of stars for, for each of these units. And that's very simple. I agree and like that. But the question is whether we can come up with the dataset of these short transcript snippets and the corresponding summaries. And,, from,, the approach that I'm proposing we would have to link,, always a candidate summary to the transcript and we would have to come up with measures which check, what is,, what is the coverage. And,, the coverage should be based in terms of important pieces of information. And these important pieces of information should be also, automatically derived, derived from the reference summaries when they are linked to the transcript, kind of. So, yea. I would like to ask PERSON8 to, to, to like proceed with thinking in, in this direction. And come up with, with a procedure that aggregates the scores and also consider, to talk to and like make sure that we get the, the proper alignment links from the annotation tool.",
            "Maybe I could send the data, I could add that,, we could try PERSON3's idea of dividing on some of the Czech data. Because some Czech data are better structured and they -",
            "It's because i was not leading.",
            "Because I, because, LOCATION1 ORGANIZATION4 this has very good leading.",
            "Okay that's good.",
            "I have, they have very good lines. So we could try to divide them.",
            "Mm-hm.",
            "And I may ask my annotators to do it quickly because they are Czech and text us Czech.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And they already from university and just them put the lines to already annotated texts.",
            "Yeah, okay, that's good. Yeah.",
            "So this is what I could do actually really quickly. So we could do that.",
            "Yeah. And so far, we have no work for PERSON4. Is that a pity? Do we want to find some, some job for you? Or. No, it's not. I have time if you have any work to do, but if it's not, it's ok.",
            "Yeah. So I think that it would be good if you,, explained to, especially PERSON8, what are your past experiments. So you can now get access to that. And I think, I'm not sure if PERSON3 has already shared with you his like, workbench or, or whatever. He is, he has a set of scripts, some repository that he's building. He should, maybe he's not finished the cleaning,, to, to the level where he wants it to be. So maybe he has not share this with you yet, but it's, it would be useful for the future. If all of you experimented within the same experimentation environment so to say. So that you could easily share the data imports, the evaluation measures. And if anybody of you implements a new evaluation measure everybody could use that and, and so on. So he has started this workbench already a year ago and he has used the, this for the numbers that he has reported to the slides, but it has, the development has started independently from what PERSON7, what, what PERSON4 did and also from what PERSON8 did. So PERSON8's extracted some outside of that. So please get in touch with PERSON3 and,, put your experiments, those that deserve it, those that are promising for the future, put them into this evaluation framework. But that the point of,, approach was kind of okay. When I was telling to PERSON3 that we should put,, even these past experiments, the relevant ones into this, into this workbench he said: \"well but that's a technique which is 10 years old or whatever so it's, let's not bother with it anymore.\" I don't really share his negative opinion on that. I think that,, the, today people can easily like create bogus results. So they, lan launch some,, some black box system and it, emits some numbers and they report it and, and the impression is that the evolution moves on but truth is that the well tested older methods are actually practically more use, then the, the newest things today. So I think it makes sense to rerun the once moved to PERSON3's repository. The, the PERSON3's workbench. Rerun it the current data and make a head to head comparison with what PERSON8 did, extractive style? And what PERSON3 did, which was this bared based thing. So, so I think that PERSON4 free of other tasks so far could try to redo, because you have this experience of putting things into one table so that they are comparable, and that's very useful skill that, it, it's very important. So if you could oversee the, the, the merge of all the approaches that we have so far.",
            "Okay. So you have other tables, or.",
            "No, well PERSON8 has like one and PERSON3 has one -",
            "PERSON3 also has one so I, the paper which PERSON4 did start. So PERSON2 did share with me, with me that paper. So I did added the PERSON3's work as well. I am adding the transformer. I did already add the transformer to it. So maybe I think PERSON4's experiment and PERSON3's experiment and my Experiment and maybe improve, just an improved model of that can be found as a paper. Just because the failure experiment can also be added to that. Just to show that it's, it's just something we experimented. So.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, that's good. So PERSON4, PERSON4 could take this from you now, merge it with what he did in the past and evaluate it in unified framework so that we would have this comparable across all of the, all of the system and that would be a paper. That's, that's good. I've heard that ORGANIZATION1 deadline has been extended. It's no longer September, the 20th of September, it's some early October.",
            "Yes, Yes, Yes.",
            "October 7th.",
            "Like 3 weeks. And since the experiments were technically done,, obviously they have to be rerun now, so that they are comparable and on the same dataset. It is conceivable, it's risky but possible that we would have this written up for, for ORGANIZATION1. So that's, that's one, one possible,, thing to aim at.",
            "Okay, possibly I have actually reframed the entire paper as well. So I added sections which PERSON3 did. So,, you can, I think you have the same link over document. We both have the same one. And disk is maybe on this.",
            "Yea we have to discuss -",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so please, please go ahead with this and do I understand correctly that PERSON4 is fine with that right? So would you, would you -",
            "Yeah. Yes.",
            "Yeah. So it would be essentially the, the basics was the paper usage PERSON4 right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Extended by PERSON8 and extended by PERSON3 right?",
            "Right.",
            "Yeah, that looked good. Ok I have to go to the other meeting so feel free to discuss whatever and also the next meeting time.",
            "Should we meet next week again?",
            "The, so I suggest these, these daily calls are fine for short synchronization task -",
            "So if we need to make one more general call.",
            "And one more general call in week would also probably make sense based on what, what PERSON3 observes on this.",
            "Data.",
            "On the splitting. Okay. Thank you.",
            "So -",
            "Any quick question?",
            "Yes. So I just to wanted to like reconfirm. So the thing is that we want to come up to a manual score based on the alignment best technique?",
            "Yeah. So the score itself is already automated. It's fully automatic. But it is based on manual alignments.",
            "Right, right, okay.",
            "And the idea of the annotation of the manual annotation is that it should be done like once and then easily reusable as more reference minutes are created. So the annotation should be stand of and reusable so that you can just recalculate the score if you get more,, more annotations of that.",
            "Right, right. Okay.",
            "Okay. Thank you. Thanks. And bye."

            "Updated summary in my ORGANIZATION1 Doc. So, okay. I'll start first. So, yeah, so I fixed the changes that you in the. So basically used to do is that it always acted only on sentence level. So then we, so like the problem which you faced was that you just complete paragraph comprising of multiple sentences, and there it failed. So, what I did is that. Will put you give the, you give us text split into sentences and it will apply on sentences. On each sentence, they got it has been trained on sentence level. Yeah, so that has been fixed. And, so yeah, and I tried with different data like your OTHER1 the best results and have with the segmenter, LOCATION1 segmenter. However like if you remember I discussed with regarding the, it discuss regarding the, what about that. Okay, nevermind, if I remember. And it was also disable and currently I am working on forced, and preparing and preparing timestamp outputs for all the the the manuality vice transcripts that we have from PROJECT2 and for PROJECT2, so I'm preparing timestamps for each these transcripts. And tommorow we also have watching session so I will prepare for that also. And next I need to prepare data for SLT, and PERSON2 proposed that he needs a volunteer to test check for PERSON8's data collection application, so I think I should be the one doing it ecause, when he used the from his domain adaptation I just used to add it to the dictionary, but now when we have the language model scripts we can we can build a new language model by adding text to the current corpus, and I think that he'll improve the ASR. Yeah. And PERSON2 also proposed that because he was also proposing that a few onths ago that PERSON5 he left I think, because he was improvising the test set for PROJECT2 that we will be using, and so he was saying that we need to find someone to look into this data set and in the worst case scenario I'll be the one doing this, but yeah, that's all from me. Hello PERSON6.",

            "So and recall.",
            "On which test set?",
            "So test set fro test set from each from each of this data set. So there was like no common test set.",
            "Okay. So, we we still don't know how does it improve the overall ASR, right?",
            "We are all, ASR?",
            "Yes, yes. So it would be good if you if you integrated and then run ASR and have someone who speaks LOCATION1 to say whether its better or not, and if you can process some some file and estimate rate, and see whether its better with or without it, so this would be proper set.",
            "So I will write this to the ORGANIZATION1 Doc and, I will, I think this would be much appropriate and better option to process the so yeah.",
            "Yes of course. Maybe would be to just take someone speaking LOCATION1 and let him guess whats better, and second it would be to evaluate it test set. It would be maybe more complicated. Okay.",
            "Yeah and about that data collection supervising data collection test, data collection for PROJECT2. So.",

            "Yeah, so its, it can be integrated with our MTs and later I can option to disable and then it would be easily integrated with ORGANIZATION2 models if its necessary and I can update it models to enable batching and talk to ORGANIZATION2 to update it on their side, specially the rainbow model. And the code need some refactorization. Yeah, so I, we realize that the prefix empty on which i was walking last week, its not working better than the baseline that we already have, Maybe better training could fix the quality but not latency and flicker. So until tomorrow I am writing papers, one is already done and the other must be written. Its the about the subtitler to OTHER4. And I have to talk to PERSON2 about about my other tasks for next week and decide the suggestion, meets ORGANIZATION4 proccesing tool. The, to download the meetings done at ORGANIZATION4 from from their website and to process it to format for mediators. Just to cut many many short videos, no audios. I should work on PROJECT2 OTHER3 submission. This is, it start at 17. March and at the end of march so this is not critical and I sh I can work on the ASR mediator binding finally, and before we use to plan interpreting analysis and write a paper about it until I for coaling. So maybe to ask PERSON2, what to do next. You, I guess you don't know, right?",
            "Yeah. So okay, just a moment. I can update PROJECT1MT to enable batching so its just batching going to affect liek what situation do you have. So we. Yeah, so.",
            "Right now we expect that the translation time is immediate, so when so when ASR emmits one hypothesis then the translation takes zero seconds and zero milisecond and is ready to display to the user. But in reality the translation take some time, about 200 miliseconds for, I don't know 50 words. And doing the translation ASR emmits new hypothesis which updates the previous one, so we can skip the already outdated hypothesis between between translating. So, that it so one the input ASR, and the other is sending it to sending it to empty and if two two sentences are updated at once then they are they are and send to empty at once and empty is is able to translate them to its able to translate 16 sentences in the same time as the one sentences. In a batch, for this means that we can 2 sentences at once and receive the translation.",
            "Okay, so you mean all the 16 sentences will be translated partirarly at once.",
            "Yes. In the same time. Independently.",
            "Um-hum, okay. So but during live translation I think how th really going to benefit as like how is it like to benefit does during live translation, because doing live translation I believe we do not have much text at once to translate.",
            "Yes, we have the incoming and its very often once.",
            "Um-hum, so these.",
            "So maybe up to sentences at once. Can be sent at one batch, and usually we can have four opened sentences. Yeah. I am not saying anything right now.",
            "Okay, so sorry. I don't have any more questions. So, and we don't have anyone else.",
            "Yes.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, so we can close the session.",
            "Yeah, we can close the session and discuss in person on, about supervising test set for data collection for PROJECT2.",
            "Yes.",
            "See you.",
            "See you, bye bye.",
            "Bye."

The the video with the subtitles on the upper side and on the lower side there's going to be ORGANIZATION1's presentation platform, showing the subtitles again. The idea is to well have some some video from from YouTube or from some other source. With either German or English spoken language. Which is going to be transcribed and then translate that to Romanian and shown on the split screen. Today's objectives are to first we we must ok. We need we need to test this set up and see if it works. Then we need to you know select one of the a video to to translate. And then we are going to need PERSON5's feedback on the quality of the on the translation to Romanian. I'm told PERSON1, sorry. Is it PERSON1 with the soft g or PERSON1 with the hard g?

            "Send messages. huh. Tap box in this, how do I send message? In in here? Ok I I'll I'll paste in the ORGANIZATION3 document.",
            "There's the side panel, you can use. If you click side panel maybe, there you could send a message.",
            "I can see only the list of the persons' name. It has to be somewhere.",
            "If you click side panel, it's where.",
            "Aha, ok, I got it yeah. So I send the link there and if you click there if you click it.",
            "And password, user name password is editor editor. I'll try that too. So it will once you once you're able to view the subtitling platform.",
            "Ok, I.",
            "So there are like lot of languages.",
            "Ok.",
            "And you might want to like unselect most of the languages from the left side. From from the right side.",
            "Ok, so now I see them all and I would have to click on each of them to unselect them?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Ok. Can I left only Oh. Well I think instead of Romanian it's showing Russian.",
            "I, yeah, I I already switch last night I think. I think Russian and Romanian they are like swapped. I I I I will soon. So can you choose Russian?",
            "Yeah, no,, Russian looks more like Czech or Slovak I think. Oh ok, there are thing they are like Polish is Romanian. So I think they're just,, the UI is just ma it should be.",
            "Yeah, ok. So that's slight bug backward that means. So I I I'll fix it finding it now. So right now the Polish is the real Romanian right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok, ok. So we need to keep up in in order to view the subtitles. So I I think PERSON4 will might want to take over from here.",
            "I think now it stopped. The thing.",
            "Yeah, because we aren't talking so. So. So,, what we see,. So can you comment anything about the subtitles, the Romanian subtitles? I mean if you look at the real English ASR and compare how how worse is it? Or is it?",
            "So I think it does have a little bit of trouble telling when new turn started. Or maybe just has lag. And it does have some some non sense in there to be honest.",
            "Huh.",
            "But I don't know if it's because of the quality of the how how we're speaking. So I can I couldn't say what we were talking about by reading,.",
            "Ok,, yeah please.",
            "I I guess I would also, I'm curious, if you have some like what kind of quality feedback would you like me to give. Maybe I could look over the transcript later on and give it some annotations or do you want just a general feel to it?",
            "PERSON4, we cannot hear you. Yeah, is we have not been hearing for you for long time.",
            "Oh yeah. I keep forgetting. Yeah.",
            "Now I hear.",
            "Yeah, ok. So that's I I pasted the shorter URL and you didn't hear me when I was ok yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, yeah. So so to answer PERSON5's question. For now a general assessment is just like a a general confirmation whether it is usable or not. With all the troubles that are common to to machine translation. Is a would be enough. Later on we actually do not have anyone to review Romanian. And what we are doing is we're collecting very diverse test set and we are asking people to not really to translate, but to t check the alignment of documents so that they can serve reliably as as test sets in our case. But Romanian was was also included in PROJECT1 in some years ago. So we're focusing. So this is what we should do. And we have not like carefully evaluated Romanian with numbers yet. But we would like to have this test set focused on the auditing domain. So right now I see that PERSON1 set up is recognizing what I'm saying in English. And that is, that means that the system is following the the audio output of of th his own machine. If he starts playing a video on YouTube then we all should be watching the same video and s we should we should be able to assess also the delay with that. And you should give us a general t assessment, like how bad the the Romanian is. And the set up that we would like to present to the project officer would be starting with Czech instead of starting with English. And there it would be good if you could like tell us how bad is the Romanian compared to the English. Which is already a result of a translation.",
            "So Czech audio which has English subtitles and I would be looking at the Romanian.",
            "Yes.",
            "Subtitles that are generated with your your.",
            "From the English.",
            "From, ok, ok.",
            "So would there be, would there be, would there be a source language that you could you could understand the source as well? Czech is obviously not the one.",
            "Yeah. Well maybe we could make sense to do both. One where I don't understand the language so I can tell you if I understand what the Romanian is saying about..",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah English would be the source that I would understand best. And maybe something like Spanish would be.",
            "Oh, yeah, I'm not sure if.",
            "Or French or Italian, then maybe.",
            "French.",
            "French maybe I would understand a little bit.",
            "Ok.",
            "German very little, but we could try it. But probably French would be if it's not a lot of colloquial stuff I might understand a little bit.",
            "Yeah, ok. So, so we have tested French ASR some weeks ago. So PERSON1 can you check whether French ASR is available? At the moment?",
            "Yes.",
            "And right now, PERSON5 you can check whether the Romanian translation of what what I was saying in English is acceptable or or not.",
            "And should I follow.",
            "And it is delayed. It is delayed again, I don't know why.",
            "Yeah, it is delayed, yeah, you're you're right..",
            "So so what is it translating from? Is it English to.",
            "From English.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "From English, yeah.",
            "So right now we have German ASR and French ASR. So I can start either of them.",
            "And then we need some source to to follow. Some some like real speech.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In French.",
            "So actually I have German set up ready. And it can be started instantaneously.",
            "Ok.",
            "So if you'd like to, if you'd like me to start the German set up.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'll I'll briefly. So are you all looking also at this demo with PERSON2 that that document, right?",
            "Document, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So at the bottom, I'm starting like notes from this test session.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And so first assessment and that was simply us talking English MT into Romanian. And here so yeah. Hard to understand what we were talking about, right? Is that is that a kind of a summary PERSON5?",
            "Yeah, I was looking to that translate. I say like some sentences do make sense but others are yeah don't make sense. And occasionally there's some random entities in there. I I I found one. Yeah, funny. Oops. It was trying to translate Czech but that in Romanian is the same as writing like a bank check.",
            "So there there is a few confusions. Yeah.. Yeah there are a few sentences that make sense and then some that are kind of half make sense.",
            "Yeah.. So ok. Thank you. So this is this is the result that I was hoping for. Because obviously it's not error proof at all. And it was not domain adapted for this particular setting discussing about the system and the languages. We should do better in the domain of interest, but I'm not sure whether we will do better. So there is a channel general text yep. So here is a video, I'll copy the link. It's, how long is that. Tell me,. Copy the link, copy link location. So PERSON1 can you now try and we we all should try looking at this video. In the German subsection.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, that's just 2 minutes. 2 and, 2 minutes 40 1 seconds.",
            "Where's the video?",
            "41 seconds. That's the video. So the link is at the very bottom of the ORGANIZATION3 document.",
            "Aha, ok ok ok. Sorry.",
            "So if you can switch now the system to follow German.",
            "Yeah, so I will I I.",
            "And the question is.",
            "So I.",
            "How do we.",
            "So I.",
            "How do we play it, so that we all have it like shared with the. How do we play the video so that we all see it at the same time?",
            "Huh.",
            "Maybe somebody could share their screen?",
            "But then the.",
            "I can try to share my screen, yeah.",
            "But that yes, you can try. But that will kill the performance of your machine. Because it would be like downloading the video, and sending the video and also doing the recognition and and sending the so that's. And and the video quality will be pretty bad when when screen shared. I'm afraid.",
            "So I can try it once. So I think now you'd be h seeing the YouTube.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, ok. So I I Set up.",
            "So maybe, maybe before cli just click play. So that we will see whether it will play. And. And then in the meantime try setting up. Yeah, it's delayed, horribly delayed.",
            "I'm going to turn my camera off for a bit now. So that mind.",
            "Yeah, yeah, feel free to do so but I don't think that it will help. Yeah, so there is no way. There is no way to watch a video in in this like shared session. So the way, PERSON5 if you can hear me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So PERSON1 please stop the video now. Or actually stop sharing the screen because that is that is only killing the the perform the performance. So what we have done in the past was that we all had our mouse buttons ready on the play button.",
            "And through this shared conference call we clicked we said 3 2 1 go and on the go we clicked the play buttons. And everybody was watching his own copy of the video. And this.",
            "Ok, we can try that.",
            "The start was synchronized. And and PERSON1 did that on the machine which was recognizing. So the subtitles were then available in the as as you are looking at them, in the online text flow window.",
            "Sorry, I have to mute the audio in order to transmit the YouTube audio.",
            "Sorry, say it again?",
            "I have to mute the meeting audio in order to transmit the the YouTube audio to the pipeline.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Ok, so that means that that you will be there but we would not be able to talk to you anymore? Because you could not hear us?",
            "Yeah, because if you if you speak again the your audio will also be transmitted to the pipeline.",
            "Yeah, so that's why you should have for the real demo, 2 machines.",
            "Yeah, exactly, yeah, you're right, 2 machines, yeah.",
            "And with one of the machines the speakers f will be muted from from the ORGANIZATION2 call.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And only the video would be there, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Do you have a cellphone that you could connect with as well at this moment or not? And that actually does ORGANIZATION2 work with cellphones.",
            "I have a iPad which might work with ORGANIZATION2 but, so right now we do not have any like login credential with ORGANIZATION2, we just use like guest link.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And that hasn't been working with with cellphones and tabs. So do you want me to try it in?",
            "S no no, let's let's do it later.",
            "Okay.",
            "So please stop sharing your screen.",
            "Okay.",
            "But then if, when when you mute the ORGANIZATION2, then you still can talk to us, right? Your microphone No. Can you, can you still talk to us or not? How do we synchronize the start?",
            "Yeah, so I I I can speak but I I have to mute your audio.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok. So are you ready for the German sound input?",
            "Yeah, so I I.",
            "So please set it up. Please set it up so that now if we keep looking at the same thing, the same screen. Then still hopefully it will like be recognizing. So should I now.",
            "Ok, so. I have to restart it now I stopped it.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Yeah, it's there now.",
            "Yeah, so now when I speak German it should be recognizing German, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely.",
            "Yeah. So so well. So in principle it is set up now. So PERSON1, we will now everybody will now go to the video tab. And everybody will prepare a window the window so that we see both. The the subtitles and the the video. And you will say 3 2 1 and on GO you will click the play for the video link, right?",
            "Ok, so.",
            "And and and we will hear, everybody will click that at the same point, at the same time on the GO signal. And we will hear, everybody will hear their own copy of the YouTube video and everyone will see the the subtitles that you are presenting in the PROJECT2 platform, right?",
            "Yeah. Yeah, right, I got it.",
            "So so I will look into this text flow window to see the subtitles and then have another window in in parallel where I'll just watch the YouTube, yes? That's where I keep the tab subtitles. Where they're displayed now.",
            "Yeah I'll.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'll try to illustrate that on by sharing my screen. Where is that, ORGANIZATION2, share my screen, entire screen,, allow. So this is what I'm sharing now. So I have the video in the left hand part. And I have the subtitles in the right hand part and they they are like, I need to scroll them to the very bottom. I'll disable whatever I don't want to follow. So I'll keep following Czech, I'll keep following English and no, I'll I'll kept. Yeah, ok. And then I I I would probably disable the other languages. So 3 languages fit reasonably well. So you, in your case, it will be good to see the German, English and Romanian.",
            "I I don't know if I will be able to follow.",
            "Yes. And then you can.",
            "So many languages.",
            "Yes exactly. And then you can dis. So you can keep just one. So whatever, it's up to you.",
            "Yeah, I'll try Romanian and for now, that's it I think.",
            "And then and then PERSON1 will say 3 2 1 GO.",
            "Okay.",
            "And then I have as I've I don't whether you have seen that but I've played the video for myself. And I heard this also in my headphones. And the subtitles on the on the video are by ORGANIZATION3. So ORGANIZATION3 is pretty good with subtitling. This is auto generated German and they can also auto generate into whatever we like. So I don't know whether you are seeing that.",
            "I can see that, yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, oh. This is no Afrikaans, I don't want Afrikaans. I wanted oh gosh. Subtitles, auto translate. I wanted to scroll it, if there is Romanian. Russian, yes, there is Romanian.",
            "So this is the ORGANIZATION3 performance. And there they are pretty good. I'm I'm afraid. So you can probably watch just Romanian by ORGANIZATION3 and Romanian by us.",
            "Ok. ok.",
            "So does that make sense?",
            "So, yeah. Can you share the link to the YouTube video?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I can set up the windows.",
            "So, the PROJECT2 window, that's here. Yep. So this is the YouTube video link. I'll I'm stopping my screen sharing now. But this is something we need to simplify. I think we heard that.",
            "Ok, it's ready to.",
            "Yeah, but it's interesting, it's interesting that I was that I heard that actually s.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Yeah, I I have headphones, so. I don't know how.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Let me just.",
            "Are are are we ready now?",
            "So so how do I put the translation on?",
            "The ORGANIZATION3 one?",
            "Ok, German auto translate. Ok I found it. I'll I'm just setting up to for the YouTube one to have Romanian. Ok. Ok. Ok, ok, well I'm I set up my window so hopefully. When you when everybody else is ready, I can start.",
            "Yeah, so everybody should have now their.",
            "So and we should not be talking.",
            "Yeah, definitely.",
            "And you should actually mute us. So so PERSON1 please mute us of on your machine. And then get ready to play and then say 3 2 1 GO and on the GO we all will click the play buttons.",
            "Ok. So, ok. Right now, ok, got it. So on a count of 3 I will get started. So 1 2 3. Ok ok.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So we have, we have audio being repeated from some someone. I think it's.",
            "I'm going to mute my.",
            "Yeah, no but then you would not be able to hear the German. Is that a problem or not? Yeah, ok. So so. So PERSON5 mute.",
            "Yeah, she can see it in the video.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Let me just. Yeah, I don't know.",
            "Or, since we, since we all hear you, let's make use of this. So I will mute my video. And and you. I will get the sound from you through the ORGANIZATION2 call. But then this is too bad for PERSON1, because PERSON1 will get it twice.",
            "No, I I I can even pause myself. Pause the video and only.",
            "No but that's that's that's that's low quality.",
            "So so to be honest I don't understand anything in German from the woman saying audio. I could also cut the sound on my video display.",
            "So so cut the s. Please cut the sound on your video. And PERSON1, remember, you need to mute the speakers, right? So, so there is mute incoming audio. So there is there is this button on the ORGANIZATION2 control panel.",
            "Aha, yeah yeah, sorry. Got it, yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah I got it now, yeah, ok.",
            "So so please try muting incoming audio now. And then confirm, that you cannot hear me anymore. So I hope that you cannot hear me. Can you hear me? Now it's muted. And please keep saying, please keep s keep talking, so that we know that the outgoing audio is fine. Please keep talking.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "So are you.",
            "So, yeah, I I I just muted my audio and I can't hear you anything.",
            "Yeah, and we can we can hear you. Yeah yeah yeah. And we can hear you all the time, that's good. So please mute, mute your incoming audio. And then tell us like 3 2 1 or you prefer 1 2 3, right? Yeah?",
            "3 2 1 is fine. 3.",
            "So no no no. Don't change it.",
            "So just do whatever you like but just one. And remember, everybody remember to scroll the the set the video to the very beginning.",
            "Yeah. Just press zero and it will search back to the zero.",
            "Oh, zero? Oh, ok. I didn't know about that. Yeah, ok.",
            "So, I'm muting myself.",
            "So now should we be no longer recognized, when I say. Yeah, when I say anything in German it is not doing anything on the recognition. But he didn't tell us where to start.",
            "I can't really follow, do you mind if we restart?",
            "Yes, sorry sorry PERSON5, I've stopped my German now.",
            "I wasn't able to follow any of it.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah it was too.",
            "And I think, and I think I started a bit later the video.",
            "Exactly. Because we didn't hear PERSON1. So I'll I'll yeah.",
            "But also it's hard to read 2 subtitles at the same time.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "I couldn't even read the YouTube subtitles.",
            "Yeah. Exactly, I couldn't follow either. So I was trying to do the same and it's very difficult to to follow it. So how how can we simplify? The set up.",
            "Well I think I could try just following your subtitles.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then seeing if I understand, then we can talk about whether I understood what video was talking about reading the subtitles. If.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON1, can you hear us now? Yeah. So we. Did did you say the 3 2 1 GO?",
            "I say fingers, with fingers.",
            "Oh I didn't see at all. But I think that your voice is not recognized, right? In the in the set up. No? Yeah, aha, ok. Yeah, so it will not take my audio because it is taking the audio from the speakers and my audio isn't on microphone.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so you can safely talk to us. So you can safely say 3 2 1 GO, while we are muted, so we do not disrupt your video.",
            "Ok. So so we shall start again.",
            "And there is one more problem, there is no Czech. The Czech is stuck. For some reason, I don't see Czech translations. But.",
            "So it was. The CS is is the real ASR one -",
            "Oh, ok ok ok. I didn't know that. So I'll.",
            "Actually we watch the back translation also and they were like yeah.",
            "So I need to copy the link. So this is this is something that we really need to make very simple. So.",
            "Yeah. We definitely will make simple this. I made the set up to watch the real ASR Czech and the back translated Czech.",
            "So I'll watch German, English and CZ.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "This is my set of languages. Ok. So my set of languages is now ready. Can I I don't see anything, is it running? I don't see anything.",
            "I do.",
            "Aha, ok. So I can share my.",
            "Sometime it happens. I I don't know why it happens.",
            "So should I reload?",
            "No I think you will need to. I don't know why it happens, but it happen with me and I had to like re-type the whole link. Like manual CZ then.",

            "You you might wh. Ok. So let me send you another link. So you click that this one and it should work for you. That's it.",
            "So What could be the problem with this? This is something that we have not. Yes, so this one works. So what is the problem?",
            "I don't know, it happen with me like.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll have to and I'll disable the CS. So I think the problem is that if I disable the CS, that's probably killing it, for some reason. No, you're right. I'll have to use the link that you sent me. So PERSON3, what is what is wrong with your set up?",
            "Oh no, nothing.",
            "It works for you.",
            "Yes. Yeah, I can deactivate languages and enable them and they work.",
            "Ok, that's good. So I'll I'm just stuck with some bad set up myself, but that's not a problem. So I think we are ready now. So, I'm seeing German, English and Czech. So, yeah, so so there were there were couple of seconds of delay, I don't know why that happened again. There is a big risk that the heavy network traffic on your machine PERSON1 will will be slowing things down.",
            "Yeah, that that's could be possible.",
            "So we need to test this actually separate of like separate of PERSON5. We don't want to waste so much time of of PERSON5. But now it's actually working, if you look at the translations. There should be me counting into up to 8, right? Yes.",
            "I saw that, yeah.",
            "Yeah. And I'll do that again just to clear the buffers. That's also important. And in the meantime, PERSON1 you should mute us and then say the and and what will you be saying? So, tell us exactly, what.",
            "1 2 3 and.",
            "Yeah, and on 3.",
            "On 3 we will all click the the video play button, right? Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So everybody reset every.",
            "As soon as you hear 3 you just click it.",
            "Yes.",
            "Your play button.",
            "You could also say click I I.",
            "1 2 click.",
            "Ok.",
            "1 2 click, ok. 1 2 click will be my statement.",
            "Yeah, ok great. So we're ready for that.",
            "So I'm going to mute myself so I.",
            "No mute ourselves and I'll.",
            "So 1 2 Click.",
            "Yeah, so. I can hear you now guys.",
            "Yeah, there was horrible delay, it is still feeding the the German there.",
            "Really?",
            "You mean test roll?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I think I soon as soon as I stopped the video it has started different for you guys. I don't know.",
            "So can you share the screen with what you saw in the text online text flow? Because I. So that's it's too complicated of a system because.",
            "So so.",
            "So PERSON5 was it delayed for you as well? You're muted probably, I don't I don't hear you.",
            "I th I might have been delayed. But I couldn't really think it without audio.",
            "I couldn't follow,. What I did note is. So I can't honestly say what exactly it was talking about. Something with services or with birds or with monitoring something.",
            "Aha, aha, yeah.",
            "So maybe I could read over it again. And I could also listen with the YouTube subtitles to see if I can understand more about it from there. I did notice it got really for example at line 181, it kept listening in listening in and it kept trying to generate this long sentence.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And then I don't know how it broke up the. So then there was a flow of like 2, 3 lines one after each other. But there was like this long, that time when, yeah. It was trying to compute one sentence. So there is I noticed that thing. I mean, I think it is having a very technical like something with the. How do you say that in English? It sounds like bureaucratic European talk. I think it gets the general idea. But yeah, I had trouble following the doc flow at some point starting with 181.",
            "Yeah. We the the numbers are unfortunately not the same for everybody I think. I'll check my numbers.",
            "So I think.",
            "So actually I.",
            "I feel that see my screen as as I paused the video it is start that line number 187. So here is selected.",
            "So I don't see your screen, for some reason, I don't see your screen.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No? Ok. I'll try to share again.",
            "Yeah, I also I reading the script 187 is the the last 1 that make sense with the previous one.",
            "187 is what was the last detected.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. That's true,",
            "And I think it stopped as soon as as I paused the video. I don't know how it kept emitting for for you, maybe.",
            "So it for me it also stopped at 187, but the problem was that it was still something which was said earlier. These are not the last sentences of the video.",
            "Aha. And and how ASR - Ok, so I know that at the MT does that it keeps emitting the all. But I think if the line number.",
            "The line numbers correspond.",
            "Yeah the line numbers are matching so they must be updated I mean. So I mean there will be quite latest did.",
            "Actually yeah you're right. So it is probably the last sentences of the, of the video. But so for some. So maybe the reason was that I I click the video playback too late myself, and that caused the little delay. That is, that is possible. Yeah yeah, you're right.Yeah so it was, I was, my video playback was late. And that that's why. That's why the video was still was talking for me. And the yeah, so this is. Ok, so there is no way that we will ask the people watching this to actually click the play button. That's too risky.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So we have to come up with a way to to launch it for them. And then there are the problem for the segmentation. That's what PERSON5 said. The the big chunk, the listening in. So actually the this particular talk is not to euro speak. These long sentences are not naturally there. The sentences the the speaker makes are are reasonable. It's our system that fails to find the the division of sentences. So that's the, that's the problem.",
            "Yeah. I mean, it it in the end it seems like it did break it apart. But as I was. Yeah but I think there's some error there. But yeah, I can. Maybe I could listen to the. I mean it's definitely something with audit and Austrian birds and this.",
            "Yeah so, it was not not the birds. Nothing about birds. It's all about.",
            "No?",
            "No.",
            "There is something with birds in in the the transcript.",
            "So so, now now you can try playing the video with the YouTube subtitles.",
            "Ok. I will, I will I will do this now.",
            "And and you will probably understand what it's about. Because I I could follow. They the YouTube subtitles are like pre-computed, so they're not live.",
            "So I I I'd like to hear speaker like you can view in YouTube's transcript, German transcript at once. And you will get like kind of history logs as we see it and I would like to show you how you can get that.",
            "Aha, in YouTube? So.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Are you sharing the screen now?",
            "Yeah, I want to share my screen.",
            "I don't.",
            "So here you see.",
            "I don't see your screen. I don't see your screen. It tells me that you have started the presentation, but I don't see it.",
            "View. Do you see it now?",
            "Maybe we'll have to wait. But I don't see it.",
            "No.",
            "It says that you have started presentation. But I still see only your face. Like live. Yeah I see on your camera.",
            "So in the video description you have like this like shared save.",
            "And there there.",
            "3 dots?",
            "3 little dots, yeah.",
            "Open transcript.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Open transcript. Yeah, ok."

            "PERSON3, seems like you may have your names set from a previous call.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yep. So are we still missing anyone? Actually, we have ORGANIZATION4, we have all the research partners, we have ORGANIZATION6. So it's. I think that we are ready start,, because, well the ORGANIZATION3 may join, or may not join. I don't know. They're not part of the project anyway. So thanks a lot for, for coming to this very late, meeting before the submission of of the deliverables. I hope that you are all looking at the, document, And I would just like to draw your attention to, the of formal rolls, That I had to write in the most boring deliverable of all, the project management guide. And, there for every work-package, there is someone's name. So please make sure, that you are not to oppose to listing these names. This is the 1st time will actually it's write this down somewhere. And we also have, deliv,, representatives for each partner. That's for, the the formal voting, if there would be any. And, in the. If you are if you are interested, then you can read this deliverable,, the, the whole project management guide. And there, I always try to highlight that we rely on your own responsibility and your own activity, And we don't really need to to do any voting in any conflicting situations. Because we do everything in agreement and we find agreement well, ahead in, time. So I'm I'm grateful that this team of of all of you works as great, as I described in that deliverable. I I hope it will survive like that. And, I just send this, the the link to this to PERSON19, who agreed to review that, full text. So, I think we can, hope, that even if he is only a very quick with the reading. That the deliverable would okay. And now, lets, go over all the deliverables that are due tomorrow evening. And, I would like everybody, the the main, the author of that, To, talk about it, to tell us what is the status, Whether it has been reviewed, and with is completely finished and ready for shipment. I would like to draw your attention to the 1st page, actually, Where it always state, that that like the cover page the the big table, which says, what type of deliverable it is. And in the template, there is accidental left the word demonstrator. And none of the current deliverables are demonstrators. So it should always state report. Then, in many cases, the authors are not filled, or or not filled some time ago. And also, the contributing partners should list the partners, who have been involved in in the work, behind that, deliverables. And also the date, that should be tomorrow. So well, the main author, please, always open the, ORGANIZATION1 again. And check, whether even these formalities are are okay. So, I'm I'm sorry for being again so immediately,, in in in the work, And I hope that you are all doing well. So we can, really do this,, a boring part and and and and submit in time, And, then have, well, some relax in the summer. So lets now go over the, deliverables. So the 1st one.",
            "The 1st one is supervised, or, was written mainly,, or or organized by ORGANIZATION5, right? So PERSON8, you are the main, person behind the, the ASR systems?",
            "I I was not the main person by that, I'm, think it was PERSON9.",
            "Yeah. So what is what is the status there? Is it, is it fully finished? Has it been reviewed?",
            "I think I can compl.",
            "Again, I I wasn't the the main module downloaded, But as I can as I can see from the document it, it's definitely been reviewed, So I suppose it's been.",
            "So I got a mail, cause I reviewed this, And it was it was PERSON19 and PERSON9, they were mainly responsible for it. And see, yeah, much fine. I got a mail from PERSON19 yesterday morning saying, that he used kind a go through the changes. And, we just had some question about this question about the scope of it, Because, the deliverables called some like yeah, report 1 on an initial ASR systems. So PERSON19 did not include some of the work there, Especially him and PERSON9 have done through the reporting period, And he said, he wanted to keep it that way, Because he would then reported this work and periodic report.",
            "Okay.",
            "I didn't. And I said: „Okay, that's the way, want to do things.\" As, long as a report is w. I was concerned that the work wasn't being reported. As long as the reports somewhere, I think that's probably okay.",
            "That is okay.",
            "What your view in it is?",
            "The problem is, that we don't have the periodic reports,, anywhere among the deliverables.",
            "I know that. But they will be done before the review wanted?",
            "Yes,, I don't know know, when they, like when they will formally ask for it, Whether they will at all, or maybe they will not ask for it at all.",
            "But it will be s.",
            "But it will be.",
            "60 days.",
            "Yes I think it's it's within 60 days, after the end of the period.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes. So, normally, like in the past, there was always a deliverable, which. And I think, well, there is a risk, that, o, 1 of the deliverables, That was originally planned for, a month 6, Formerly, was postponed by us to month 18.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And that will be this report. So I hope, we can still, the like, describe it as a periodic report.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Which will be written after the end of period 1, so after, June 30, But surely before well, before the review.",
            "Yeah, I mean it is.",
            "So in early summer.",
            "He talked about the progress report. He would describe the complete work and the progression form, just assume me is essentially the periodic report or the 1, we're talking about, anyway.",
            "So I'll try to figure out what is, needed in the system.",
            "Um-mm. Sorry, it's bit late for.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Within this. But.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I would have. Yeah. I I emailed PERSON19 last week, And I heard back from yesterday morning so.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, I have this vague impression, that yes, something could be, could be expected from us. And, I was totally overloaded with the, other deliverables. So I didn't.",
            "Um-hum, um-hum.",
            "I didn't, oh,,, I cannot log into the SIGMA portal. The continuous reporting doesn't work. It says,, not found 404, so.",
            "Great.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I cannot look in the in the portal of the moment at all, But, I agree, with the experience of PERSON19 and, you as well. We will have to provide a progress report, or periodic report, whatever it is the name. It will have to be ready well, had before the review, And we have the review date,, already, PERSON16, right? Yeah.",
            "Yes, September.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yes it's I think like 8th, of September.",
            "8th of September, yes.",
            "So I think, that we should we should probably, have this periodic report ready by the end of July,,",
            "Um-mm.",
            "Even if we are late according to the to the SIGMA. But it's it's about work, that has been done in the past. So for people like PERSON19, it will involve a little bit more of writing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They, didn't put, some of these details into the deliverables. For most of us, we have already put, our work into the deliverables because they.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thematically match and and then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The a progress report will simply say: „Well, it's in the deliverable, which has been submitted.\"",
            "Yeah, I mean, I meant I'm well in favor of not repeating stuff in the deliverables.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I I think, that reviewers will thank us for not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Having access of repetition.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so, back to, D2.1 on initial ASR systems. I when I browse it it there, yeah, there is just little bit. Yeah. So, so the response from PERSON19 was that he will finish the edits during today, right?",
            "U, he didn't s he didn't think give the time, he just said, he will he'll. He thank thanks the review, he's gonna work in the edits. And he talks about this this this crush.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In this scope.",
            "Yeah, because there is still lot of, a lot of comments by you, which are unresolved. So PERSON8, if you can,, if you can make sure, that PERSON19, Or you, or PERSON9, or whoever, simply finishes, all the outstanding questions?",
            "Yeah, I'm.",
            "By PERSON3.",
            "I think, PERSON8 wasn't involved in that, was he? Is that right?",
            "I wasn't, but I have contact to PERSON19.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some someone from ORGANIZATION8 was involved.",
            "That's.",
            "From ORGANIZATION8.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. So I'll make sure, that the colleagues of mine will,, will do their parts. And. Yeah, there is also something. So so everybody,, every author should make sure, during today, that these questions are, resolved. And PERSON3, is there anything critical? So that if we tomorrow, the evening.",
            "No, I don't think that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No I I don't think there is anything critical. I mean, this our a main question, that was about the scope whether we should.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But you know.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So that looks, reasonably good. That's perfect. So lets move, so reviewed, yes,, done not yet. So here, I will say, that,, Every author, to resolve,, PERSON3's questions today. Okay,, then, the deliverable, on spoken language translation system. It has been finished, according to the main author. It has been reviewed by PERSON12. So what is the status there? Are there any? -",
            "I went through the review comment on Saturday and.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And I have I have addressed them. And there was a couple queries, they went PERSON8 and PERSON11.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Just about, I think,, ORGANIZATION6 would ask some questions about the normalization. I'm not sure to. Well, I I'd like PERSON8 and PERSON11 just to a look into the they can resolve.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I think in PERSON8's case it may be the. I think they. ORGANIZATION6 is asking evaluation figures guess. We don't have such figures, then it's not much we can do. This stage, but yeah, just have a quick look at. It shouldn't take long to resolve them. Other then then I I can have a I should have a quick read with the deliverable and then we're done.",
            "Yeah, okay. That's great.",
            "And I I can give you it tomorrow. I assume, when you said tomorrow evening, you don't really want, You don't really mean.",
            "A midnight.",
            "Night, midnight.",
            "Yeah,",
            "I assume.",
            "Well, that that's the last resort, but I would prefer to do it earlier.",
            "Well, I know, I know you should say that that it is. I mean, I'll do it tomorrow morning, I would expect so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I assume you're looking a list by closing business tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would been.",
            "And hopefully submission system is not down.",
            "And hopefully, submission system is not down, yes. It is unknown. So we maybe they're getting ready for the flood of re, of deliverables. Yeah.",
            "Maybe yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I I hopefully I get that to you tomorrow morning, actually.",
            "Um-hum. Yeah. That's really great. So I see PERSON11 on the call. So PERSON11, can you just please confirm, that you will the? - That you have heard PERSON3?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, perfect. Okay, thank you. So that's the 2nd one,, so I will, Right here, only, PERSON8 plus, PERSON11 minor answers.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Yeah. Then summarization. So that's something, that we have, written up, and PERSON9 has reviewed. I don't know whether, PERSON3 you know, anything from PERSON9, what.",
            "PERSON9 is on the call, isn't he?",
            "Yeah, I'm I'm in.",
            "Oh, oh, sure!",
            "Yeah, yeah I for some reason, I I I keep scanning the names, And you are you are hidden among your books, so.",
            "Oh, okay,",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I reviewed this, last week. I think my main comments were like overall, write well, it was explained. Well,, but there was maybe a a lack of detail in places. It could have used a few numbers.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "If you fill more examples, just to illustrate things, And also in there were, I think 4 papers include it.",
            "Yes.",
            "The the dependences.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Those 1 actually even mentioned in the main text, so there should be some kind of link.",
            "Yes I.",
            "Ideally a summary of each each paper, like maybe a paragraph, or so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is some.",
            "At least some kind of link.",
            "This is something, that I asked PERSON10 to do, independently last week as well, And I don't know whether he is already done that,, or not. So.",
            "I decide, I just took look this morning, And, it doesn't look like it's changed since.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Since later.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so that's important thing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON10 to, summarize, the 4 attached papers. And then well, with the numbers and illustrations, I'm afraid that nothing more will, be edit.",
            "That that's that's okay.",
            "Yeah?",
            "Yeah. That's not a not a big deal. Yeah, I had a few minor comments, as well.",
            "Yeah. The the problem is that the the baseline output so far, are so bad, That the, numbers and and, even, outputs, are not what showing at all.",
            "Yeah,, I can't impression, as a as a reader, And yeah, I didn't necessarily numbers I an idea of how bad it is slightly.",
            "Okay.",
            "A restrictive example like, is it.",
            "Um-hum,",
            "Is it almost usable, or is it completely hopeless?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Our our current state. And I think, get a strong sense to them?",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, so we'll definitely do the the 1st part, Summarizing the the 4 p attached papers, And I'll ask to PERSON10 to, if if he has examples, to to illustrate them to. But I know that he would be very reluctant to do, so. So.",
            "Okay. That's no big deal.",
            "Yeah,, thank you. Thanks a lot. So the next, deliverable is by us. It was actually written by PERSON18. And that's on the, workshop, that we, prepared, But never ran, f at ORGANIZATION2 Congress. And I have no idea whether it was reviewed by PERSON6, or or not. So PERSON2, would you would you know?",
            "Yeah,, he needs to review it, not reviewed at at the moment.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so that's. Please, do so, because we still need to, like edit do the edits. So the sooner you have it, the the better. W I see, that we input the slides. So obviously, there is no need to like do care for revision of the slides, But, there is, the need to, to review, the text itself. If it's, complete and,,, if anything else would be, would be good to know, for, the external reviewer.",
            "Of course.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I s I hear, that you have a lot of background noise in your office. So I'm happy that you are mute in most of the time this.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So, This is a very important, to be done, today, by PERSON6. Yeah. Okay, and then report on dissemination activities. So is it actually finished? Or, what is missing there?",
            "What what is miss is, the description of the event. I don't know, which which institutions are organisation.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is us this is us, yeah.",
            "Okay, yeah. Okay, and what we need more is a little bit in the part of outlook 2020 and the conclusion.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Some, page partner would be good, if we have somewhere.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Input.",
            "Okay. So this is, so this is for every. Thank you PERSON2. So this is for everyone. So first of all, I would like to thank everybody for providing their Bibtechs. I know, that the layout is ugly, but, I suggest that we'd leave it like that. PERSON3, anyway, if I remember correctly mention that in the system, There is some separate the tap, or the publication should be inserted. So, we'll do the reformatting when I'm able to see that tap. And, for now, I think it's it's sufficient as it as it is. So just everybody make sure that your publications are not missing, That your publications actually made it to this list. I send that email, on Friday. So you only need to put your Bibtechs into the file called Biblio bib, And that, that's it, that would,, that would automatically include it. So please, check it actually worked. And then, as PERSON2 said,, please have a look the outlook section, Which is section 4. And, th yeah. What what plans do we have? So we have obviously, the Congress as a plan, But, we also had, for example, the Tedx, We considered the Tedx, event. And if you have any other such events, that, are likely to, to happen, Then, consider mentioning them as an option,, Because, the more dissemination we do, the the better. It's obviously unclear, if such events will happen in person or remotely, But, just, listing them here, is good for us, So that we don't forget about these opportunities and don't miss them accidentally. So had as anybody have any idea what what we could do? What would there be any? - No, not in a moment. Yeah, I'm also, aware only of of, the of the Congress, And actually the MT marathon, which, has been silently postponed, it is planned for, September. And the current plan is to, to run it in, January, But we have not really, decided on the main organizer, Because the the past main organizer, PERSON1 will be in ORGANIZATION7, And it doesn't make sense, for, PERSON1 to organize, MT marathon in LOCATION1 remotely. So we're w, we are not sure, who should be the main, person there, But I'm mentioning MT marathon because they are really wanted to test the technology again. So I wanted,, to, to do a live subtitling of English, scientific presentations into the many languages. So that's why I'm mentioning it, And I think it it's a good idea to put in here, into this, deliverable, but, yeah. I see also PROJECT1's, so PROJECT1's subtitling is PERSON15, right? Or is it? - PERSON14! I see PERSON14 here. So.",
            "No, yeah, it's me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON14, you have this, this German event, the CCC Conference. Maybe that's good idea to discuss it, now here. I don't hear you yet. So maybe a microphone doesn't work. Is there any chat window? Yeah, so is. Yeah, wrong microphone, yes, okay. So PERSON14 cannot, speak, But, I'm not sure, whether he emailed it to everybody recently, or only to me recently, There was this, German hackers conference CCC. I don't know whether F, PERSON8 knows about it.",
            "Very much do.",
            "You you very much do. Okay, Yeah. And last time,,, PERSON19 was very, afraid of, showing the system to any hackers, because, we never focused on security of of the solution. And, obviously,, our focus on the security has not changed, much, But still,, I would like to, reconsider again, if you would like to try to get to that conference, To provide subtitling there because it's it's a nice stress test of of the system.",
            "So as I remember, these, this is a very large conference in terms of hacker conference, as they do have 9 interpretation at.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Well, okay. Yeah, I I think that could be good idea, and I think, they'll still be interested security or not. I just checked their blog and whether or not it will happen will be known in October.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So.",
            "When they will give the the.",
            "Um-hum, yeah. So could you mention that, here, in the outlook as an option? That we are like considering, and even all the concerns that, we may not be ready. What we should be. So is it, is it bigger than the ORGANIZATION2 Congress? The ORGANIZATION2 Congress would be like.",
            "What is been, again?",
            "That's f 400 if I'm not mistaken.",
            "Oh, definitely bigger.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "Hello?",
            "Yep.",
            "Um-hum. So PERSON14?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry. Yeah, I've I f I think, that especially since it will will be held in Leipzig, if it ever happens, I think it's like 15000 some people like this? -",
            "Was 18000.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Like 5 halls and really huge once. Also, I'm not sure if they've now letl u let us, but yeah. I think, it would be nice to have anything.",
            "Sorry.",
            "And I mean, they will want to demo live translation system. We don't really to do.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "A good point. Also, yeah, it a an opportunity to test it on something, because this year will be probably. We have very few events. When I ask, if we will if ORGANIZATION3 will be doing, anything that,,, Well, where we may be would test,. I don't think they have many things plan, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I don't. Well, it can happen, but I don't think, they can plan an international event, And then invite us, and,, well. Well,, how to say it? Well the things go slow, so the doing that.",
            "Um-hum. So there is no chance.",
            "We does not.",
            "I don't think the. Yeah. I don't think, it will happen.",
            "They they can absolutely like will decide in October, And the reason they will decide in October is because it's all organized by volunteers, generally motivated more volunteers. And I think, if they are interested in, in what we are doing, Then they will have no problem, inviting us in October and and organizing all that stuff. Or we o. Inviting us on the actual event. That's that's the point of mechanism. They'll they'll said then yeah.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "If they are interested.",
            "Yeah, okay, so PERSON8.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I would like to ask both, PERSON8 and PERSON14 to keep, an eye on that. Because I'm may forgot forget, and I may not look, at it in October. So lets not miss this opportunity. Lets lets,, lets plan trying it.",
            "I I can say, ahead of time that while I'm interested, I don't think I would be able to attend, actually.",
            "In person?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know the dates myself, so it's.",
            "It's it's between Christmas and New Years.",
            "Oh, yeah, well, I know that I won't be able to, to attend. So. I'm I'm tot I'm totally busy with, with a family during that time. So and also PERSON15, will be already in Germany by then, And. Yeah. And, he, over the Christmas the break, he could actually help us. So this is this is more promising. I don't want to, to, to commit PERSON15 to anything without, his 1st, 1st discussing it with with him so. So, but there is the the option, and we are trying to get, substitute, people, obviously. So so if w that that is definitely necessary for the ORGANIZATION2 Congress. So there PERSON15 will try to get back to LOCATION1 for the ORGANIZATION2 Congress. And gets like, an excuse from missing some of the lectures in in Saarbrücken, But we need someone, who will, regularly, test the systems before the event. So I'll let you know, when when I successfully have a person. I have 1, who is the very skilled, but he is now still in LOCATION2, And and it's very, difficult to to get him over. So we'll see. So this is work in in progress on the on the management, point of view. So to to conclude the events, I've, edit the CCC in Leipzig, The MT marathons in LOCATION1, like a placeholder for that, into the section. And also the regular Monday seminars. I would like to ask others to add, their other ideas, So the. If you know about Tedx, or anything, then please, propose these opportunities. And that's probably it. So PERSON16 was reviewing this deliverable,, right? So was there anything else that, that was like, bad and should be fixed, before sending it?",
            "Well, I fixed slightly the the executive summary, and then. It.",
            "Yeah. It it is the a complete paper and like complete document and if if if there is if the deliverable is too bad, then the reviewers will tell us and we will have to, redo it. That that has happened in other projects in the past, And it's not too bad if if it's just 1 deliverable. But this 1 is like actually,, I think it's fairly, complete, it's it's lengthy and.",
            "I tested 1 section is missing there. The.",
            "What? -",
            "The 1st one the.",
            "Yeah, the J yeah, yeah, that's us. Okay. So, here to summarize,. So it was actually reviewed, yes. But what is, what is needed is, everyone, propose outlook on events and that's especially PERSON8. Maybe F it would be better I think, if PERSON8 writes about CCC, than PERSON14. PERSON8 to write about CCC, PERSON17 about, LOCATION1 events, um. and then, what else was there? No, that was it. Yeah.",
            "Sorry, well, I guess we're missing Metaphorum because we did.",
            "Yes, yes. So, do you know anything about it? I'm not following any updates.",
            "I I was there, but yeah, that was all I know about it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No matter. No no for I look, in fact we attend Metaphorum.",
            "Oh! Yes.",
            "It's no there. I mean.",
            "No there.",
            "Is it is it suppose to cover all events that we attend at all.",
            "Yes.",
            "But lead.",
            "Yes.",
            "Is that right?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Not there,",
            "Well, the. I'm afraid, it could be missing.",
            "Okay, let me go. Papers, we don't have to include conferences, then. Because that would just be.",
            "Yes, exactly. We don't have to include confrences.",
            "Okay.",
            "And this, I've asked PERSON6 to do, spell-checking, And, h this is still this is not been done yet. So the, Actually,, PERSON2, would you, whether the, the table, That we are collecting in the continuous reporting, Whether this has been checked, like item by item? So that the non-scientific events are, are there? We have this.",
            "Good question.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't really know, no.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So that's exactly the Metaphorum, that's colon 0. So the. I'll copy paste, the sheet here. So it is an ugly dissemination activities, in our table. So about the Tedx, I I see also that. ORGANIZATION6, you were you at that at that Tedx event? And did you somehow present PROJECT1? Obviously.",
            "Yes, actually we we we were not on the stage, We presented the project to the audience during the breaks of.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Of the show.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And. Yes, and we present the video, and we talked about it with people.",
            "Yeah. And this is not in the deliverable either, right?",
            "I I were trying to check it,, but we didn't. It's not.",
            "Yeah, it's not, it's not. Okay,, that's too bad then. Because it's. If we have already done some activity and we are not reporting in, That will be missed and it we would not get the credit for that. So it's like to asking.",
            "Okay,",
            "Not asking for your salary at the end of the month. So.",
            "Yeah. So, then, the question is actually, PERSON2, would you, would you be able to, to process the table somehow? Or what, what is the best, take on that? W in the table we even have these, these strange numbers. So. Do we want, w? - What what's the easiest way of listing this? I think that, we should not provide too much detail, But we should not miss any of the events. So PERSON2, could you please make sure, that there is, also. As as we have like like the boring list of the, scientific dissemination, all the papers, That we also have,, a boring list of, like non-scientific, dissemination activities, at the beginning of, of this, section. And that all the relevant columns, from, the PROJECT1 continuous reporting table, The the google sheet appear there. And w. That there are not even, details about it, just mentioning like PROJECT1 was present at this Metaphorum, 2019. And PROJECT1 was present at this PROJECT2.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So just make it a list of, list of lines.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, when you where you know, it would be nice to add, 5 words of description where you do not know, then leave it just as a as a bullet point. And then bellow this list, there should be the more details about the events, which are already described. It's like, a little bit assorted, So that we are not talking about the most important events in detail, And, we are talking about small events in in much more detail,, lets live with that. But, we have to have a complete list, at the beginning, of that section. So PERSON2, please.",
            "Of course.",
            "Please ad this.",
            "Yeah, we will have a something like an overview of all events and then how? -",
            "And then the details.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So please, do it also today, so that tomorrow in the morning we can polish, whatever type setting issues.",
            "Of course.",
            "And things like that.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Okay. So, here I will add in. PERSON2 PERSON2 to make a list of events,, at the beginning, of non-scientific, dissemination. What is the nicer nicer way of saying non-scientific? Like a. Yeah. Okay. So, this will be to to again done today, and tomorrow, we will finalize it, during our review of, of that. And the last deliverable that we have, is the project management guide, Which was finished just this morning. And PERSON19 will hopefully review that. And, by the end of tomorrow, we will, send it, so that's what I've talked about, at the beginning. Make sure, that you are not opposed to your names being listed there. But you are doing the job so the. You should not be opposed. And, I don't thi I don't see, there is anything critical there. Hopefully PERSON19 will sill, will still send me the the feedback. Yeah. So let me try the, the continuous reporting again. No, no, doesn't really work. So, I don't know if you have any further questions to the deliverables or not? Yeah, no it now it's now it's totally, crushing. So, we will hopefully finish smoothly this and submit all the deliverables, tomorrow. We will have to ask you for all the financial details, which we already have asked. And also the, the progress reports, which primarily will say: „All is describe in this deliverable and this deliverable.\" And and and so on. But some people like PERSON19 will have to,, add some more details. And, my internal idea is to have, to ask for this,, details by the end of July, So that we can smoothly, send it for,, to to the to the reviewers, at the end of July or very early in, in August. And then we can run review in, early September. And for the, review, we should actually, prepare that. Every w every work-package, we will have to provide some overview ourselves, For the, for the whole project. And each partner will have to, or each representative of each leader of work-package will have to collect the information from all the partners, who contributed. So there will be. We'll prepare an agenda and as we had for the pre-review. Again, every work-package will be presenting. So please, plan that and plan to prepare, these presentations. And I think, that, we should probably, do a pre-review, like a early the the week before. So what about Friday the the 4th of September? Would that work for you?",
            "So On PERSON17, remind this th what what's the day it the review again? This is a.",
            "It's 8th it's Tuesday the 8th.",
            "Tuesday the 8th of September, and it's online is it?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. And it's all in a 1 day.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. Right. Yeah, I mean how in a LOCATION1 is week before is like a good idea, cause at least and you have time to.",
            "To fix it.",
            "Yeah. yeah.",
            "And we don't naturally haved have a look LOCATION1 just on 1 day?",
            "That's right. Yeah.",
            "I mean in in fact project because it's June and summer will be as no way they can.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Be with children. Couldn't commit having whole day free. The manager split the review up and it's in 3.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "In our sections. But it's.",
            "Oh. Even even the official review is split?",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "U, I think, I'm okay with having a full day review, I don't have every else fells like a bad but.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay. So we'll, anyway, we.",
            "But.",
            "We'll probably sent the doodle poll about this. But. So PERSON16, please, please take a note, and, lets ask about it, to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To everybody. So that they are fine with that, but, the, like dry run should be ideally on Friday the 4th.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Dry run, of.",
            "Well, the reviews are sent and choose, okay.",
            "Yes.",
            "So even I am I, I mean that that I mean so you're under the pressure to fix your presentations at weekend so.",
            "Yeah. You could even.",
            "I would fix sometimes during that week or.",
            "So you do earlier? Earlier than the Friday?",
            "Yeah, I mean Friday is probably okay, I mean when you have Monday to fix your presentation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You'd not be busy if you not work on it at weekend.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So so it's probably okay. But no later within from a day.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "It's the it's the latest day, I count it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thanks. And that. So so that's review and some meeting with the advisory committee was.",
            "Yes.",
            "Not.",
            "Yet.",
            "That's not fixed yet.",
            "Followed that.",
            "Definitely and,, according to the doodle poll, which several people, who should be on the, advisory board have not responded to yet. It it so base on the current votes, the late August, the 19th of August looks best. So that is my preference now, But I still, probably need to ask the, ask again the, those, who have not responded. So it is definitely not going to happen today.",
            "I was good.",
            "Yeah. So there is. During the summer we will have to collect all the,, materials for the review,, which is a financial stuff. And for all of you this will be a little bit of work, like for your financial, departments, at least. We expect these, details, from you to arrive, in mid-July, right? Or somewhere around that time,. PERSON16, when we we ourselves will have this,, around mid-July, So that till the end of July, we will we we should have it from everybody. And, very early in September, sorry, in August, we should, we should finalize it, and enter each to the system. Maybe, actually the entering of the numbers in is done by each of you, separately. We'll see how that works. In the past, it was sometimes that it was entered by the coordinator, And sometimes it was entered by the participants. We'll see, what is, what is the true here. And, we will have the user and advisor meeting, And we will have, the. We need to write progress report and prepare the presentations for the, for the review. So there is plenty of time, there's but there is also plenty of gaps, where you cannot really work during, the summer. So it's it's balanced, it's, it's doable, but not not too not too comfortable.",
            "Yes, and, we've the. PERSON2, we've the. ORGANIZATION4 financial department, probably it's better to warn them ahead because.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So far, I. You know. It takes a more time than to other partners, so to have the numbers really ready.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So you probably should start them earlier.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Maybe you know. So in the end, did we get the preview numbers from? - No, not yet. Okay, yeah. So we got, the the preview numbers from everybody and, except for ORGANIZATION4, And that's, that was the purpose of the test to see that you know, Who are you accounting people and they know, how to fill these tables. So it succeeded for everybody except ORGANIZATION4, who are still,, preparing that. So now, getting the update with the full final, numbers, after the end of, June, should be easy for you. Still we need to compile, that together and, yeah, at at the one missing partner. Okay,, so I think that's it. I'm not sure if we'll. Well, we'll be in touch by email, And I expect, that your response time will be now, rather than the next business date will be like the next week because I can, accidentally ask you, or away. So I'll we'll plan, things some more was some more time ahead. W I think that, no call will, be done over the summer, except for any emergency. But we. Even before the summer starts, so in the, in in the re till the end of this week,, we should, figure out the date for the dry run, for the for the review. And that will be so we'll, see each other, only for this dry run, for the review after the, summer, right? Okay, so thanks, I think, that's everything from me, And please, start finishing the deliverables, so that I can submit them in in time. Okay, so thanks for and when we are enjoying summer.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye, bye.",

            "Hi.",
            "Hi. We have PERSON13 and PERSON13 probably mean PERSON17 as well?",
            "No, it's just me, PERSON17.",
            "Okay it's. Yeah, okay. Great. So, we have ORGANIZATION2. We have ORGANIZATION10. And PERSON15, you are the only one from ORGANIZATION10, right, for today?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So are we waiting for anyone? I don't think so. I think that we are full. That we're complete. Is it okay. So thanks, everybody, for working hard on on the report and other things. And and the project and thanks for joining this call. This call is again being recorded for the purposes of our minuting. So I hope that you are fine with that. And let's let's move quickly to the agenda for today, which is in the ORGANIZATION11 document. It was very messy still early in the morning, But we've worked hard to to make some sense of that now. So please interrupt me at any stage and otherwise, I'll try to be as quick as possible with this call. Because we have some things to to do to finish quickly. So the most important thing is that there is other calls. There was kind of too many goals planned. So it was confusing for everybody. But two more calls are planned. One is for this afternoon and that will be a technical call for the second dry run that we will do at in LOCATION4. So there there there would be me, PERSON20, PERSON17 and PERSON13, not PERSON2, if I'm not mistaken. But PERSON15 will be there, PERSON9, PERSON13 and maybe maybe PERSON25 could join.",
            "PERSON25 is coming.",
            "PERSON25 is is coming for the meeting. For the af.",
            "Yes.",
            "For the afternoon. Yes, okay. Yeah, so that will be good. And yeah.",
            "Sorry, Andre, what time was that call at? That is it?",
            "1 LOCATION3 time.",
            "Oh, it's 1 LOCATION3 time, okay.",
            "So 12 in your time. That's that's 12 of your time.",
            "That's the after this one. Sorry.",
            "No, it's not. There there is -",
            "Well, yeah, right.",
            "But for you, that might be too early of of for lunch break. Yeah, okay.",
            "So yeah, okay.",
            "Sorry, I I am - Yeah. Okay, and the other call is for minuting demonstrator. And this is something that doesn't need to be - Anything doesn't have to be developed, or carefully designed. But by the end of the year, we have to have a clear idea. What the minuting demonstrator will be. And I would like to have a vague idea of this before we have the remote review. So that's why I'm I'm trying to get this call done before the remote review, Which is on October 23rd. Yes. And currently the slot has been picked for Friday, October 11th at 10 LOCATION3 time. And this is - So please, especially ORGANIZATION10 and ORGANIZATION2, make sure, that you have this slot available. I know that that ORGANIZATION2 is is busy with many things, But PERSON21, or PERSON3, or whoever. Please, make sure, that PERSON23 and PERSON5 are available before for for this date. So this is this is important. Yeah. Okay. And for the review meeting, there is a number of materials that we would like to prepare. And that we would like to actually submit by - Well at the end of October 8th or during October 9th or two weeks before the remote review. And these materials are financial status, the status on dissemination and the overall progress report. So for the financial status, I think that everybody has filled their data in. So I would just like to hear from you, that you think, that your data is is in.",
            "There is still from ORGANIZATION2 we're missing the estimates for month 18. Otherwise -",
            "Yeah, yeah. We are We're sorry, we currently don't have those because both friends and PERSON23 are currently sick.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I'm usually not - I haven't joined a single call, so this is my first time and -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So I'm very sorry. So I just wanted to be here anyways. I don't know where the rest of ORGANIZATION2 is in terms of project management. So, so sorry about that. I will tell friends and PERSON23 about the - About October 11th and I'll talk to the guys to get the - Estimate it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'll make it.",
            "Yeah. So please talk directly to PERSON11 about this so that we have these these numbers. And we'll process them. And if anything is unclear, We will ask the respective partner because we need to make sense of that and we need to present this at the remote review. And also maybe we would like to write it down in the progress report. That we are submitting in in a week from now. Yeah. Okay. Then the dissemination and communication activities. This is the continuous reporting spreadsheet. So if you look into that spreadsheet, there is a number of steps. And one of those steps is called dissemination. And this is where we are gathering the non-paper, non non-scientific things. So this is often very hard to to collect from research partners. Because everybody is focused on the papers. So please think again, were have you presented PROJECT4 so far, Where where you have mentioned that and fill this table. This is actually input for ORGANIZATION2. Because ORGANIZATION2 is is the kind of responsible for our dissemination activities. So ORGANIZATION2 will - Should like make sure that this picture is is as complete as possible. And an interesting for the reviewers to to hear. So I've said the date for this in 2 days from now, Because I think that many of us have entered things there. If something is missing, well, we are just not selling what we have done. And that's a pity, but it's not too bad. So that's why I'm not like too stressed about the deadline in 2 days. But think, what you have done and please fill that table.",
            "Okay and that table has also the second part below. And some of you sometimes forget to sell the numbers. About the people the amount of people who attended that event.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this don't forget.",
            "So that's like an estimate of impact. So how you how successful the the particular presentation was in terms of, Well, people addressed.",
            "And and how empty - And however we supposed to get this breakdown of them?",
            "Well.",
            "I'm I'm just making it harder.",
            "Because like I was - I added a column all last week. And this is - I was at the, I was presenting, I saw some people, Who were clearly from the scientific community. There were - I knew it was like a festival that was also run for public. So I knew that there were some people like from the street, essentially, That I just made made up an estimate.",
            "Okay, alright. I I just discovered that 200 registered thematic forum. But obviously we're getting a breakdown a bit difficult.",
            "No. Yeah, well. Then - Yeah. Whenever -",
            "Yeah. Okay. So that's that the that's the dissemination, communication activities. And then the progress report. Thanks again everybody for writing, or many paragraphs and sections to that report. As of now we have about 23 sections, so so 23 pages. So that's that's reasonable. We will carefully reviewed review that. And one thing that I want to say is, that we will sub we will be submitting this at the end of October 8th. So in a week from now, or maybe the October of 9th, but not later. But what is missing is the publications, the scientific ones. So please enter your publications in standard BibTeX format in section 9.2 into this ORGANIZATION8. So this is something that you have valid. You have published many, many papers. Whenever a paper acknowledge PROJECT4, make sure to include Bib entry. And briefly comment in just one sentence, how the paper is related to the project. We will be doing this collection later on for the for the meet-project review in a proper way, Where we will need also the PDFs, I guess. And and yeah - But for now, we just want to show off that we are working on the scientific part like diligently. So this is something, which is very much like up-to-date, very much needed in the coming days. So please, do this. Do any of finalization, any edits of the report that you would like to do by the end of the week, including Sunday. So that we have one or two days to to polish each and submitted them. And then it already will be time to start preparing presentations for the remote review. As I said, the remote review will be in 2, 3, 3 weeks from now. So it's in the agenda which is linked here below. There is there are people nominated who are responsible for presenting. If you want someone else from your from your institution to present, just change the agenda. So don't worry to change the agenda, but as long as your name is there, You're responsible for making the slide. Remember, therefore the slides we have some templates, both ORGANIZATION11 slides and ORGANIZATION8. So share whatever you like. We'll we'll probably send around a reminder with links like how to how to best prepare they at the slides, but the content is on you essentially. So regardless the template, please start collecting the the content. And most of the content is actually what it's already written by you in the progress report. So that should not be too much work either, but it's good to be ready for that. Yes. So the the important - Yeah.",
            "Will?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Is there template for the slides?",
            "Yes, there is templates. There is either a ORGANIZATION11 slide template for or ORGANIZATION8 template, so Latex beamer template. So both is available and we will send the links to these - So maybe, maybe PERSON11 write down and PERSON11 finished before your prepares presentations. Yeah, yeah. So ORGANIZATION5 will send a reminder with the templates of the slides. Yeah, so and this is for - Okay, so now for the milestones. There is one milestone, which is which was due yesterday. And I didn't take it off. So let's discuss this first if we can take it off. The milestone says initial ASR systems and the initial ASR systems should be available to the consortium. That's a system available to the consortium. That's like the means of verification. And there is no further details on this milestones anywhere in our description of work. So it's up to us what we what we include as as the important part. We know that we need some of the languages. This is the set of languages that we need. We have English done, German is also available at ORGANIZATION7, we have Czech working some first version at ORGANIZATION5. So I would like you to to hear about the status of the other languages.",
            "Okay, so for French, Spanish, Italian, we have initial systems.",
            "And Italian is someone between French and Spanish. So it's not as French. Not as okay as Spanish.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And Russian we are left behind. My fault I just said, the data Russians systems.",
            "So you - So you're working - you're working on Russian as well.",
            "Started Russian as well. It's -",
            "Yeah. So the question is, can we can we take the milestone off or should we delayed? What What would you recommend?",
            "To train the new one.",
            "To train the new. But if you want to kick off the milestone, I mean, we can say we have the Russians systems but -",
            "Yeah, yeah. I suggest - Yeah. So I suggest that I take it because we -",
            "Sorry, I didn't hear you well.",
            "So if you want to take off the milestone, you can say we have a Russian system and that's all.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay, So I'll I'll suggest that I'll take it off. We're already one day late but yeah - Let's take it off. The milestone was not specific about the set of languages anyway. So this is -",
            "That is you know leave out Russian.",
            "Yeah. So well, it's in - We know that the Russian is the one of the languages that we promised to cover.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But that's not directly linked to the milestone. So that's why we can be like not very specific about that. And I think that the set of language that we do have covered is sufficient for like a successful run for the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. So I think that from this point of view, it's okay to take the milestone off. So I'll do that today. Thank you. And for the milestone, which was supposed to be finished by the end of August, I would like to know this adjust from ORGANIZATION2, because that that's a pity that PERSON is sick. But I was hoping that we could run a demo session in ORGANIZATION2 platform now for everybody, Who is running on Windows so that we would see how like how far did you get, but yeah. So please let me know what is what is the status.",
            "PERSON3 -",
            "I am talking. Do you want to go ahead? Or should I?",
            "Go ahead.",
            "All right. So currently the status as we implement the translated or English as the language as you can select them on the web page. Which one you want to select, which ones you want to have translated to. And you also have implemented to overlay in the client itself. So the languages get translated or get presented, then declined itself. Whichever you chose on the web page you will have translated to.",
            "Yeah, so so from your point of view, it's seems like finished. It's translating and -",
            "It's been a rough deployment state. So It is deployed right now. We can show you.",
            "So the, company on production that you use, there's three rooms. The first one translates to has translation enabled to English. The second one to German. And the third because we're missing the client integration has both enabled. So it will be translated into both, Which means you will see a mix of the spoken words interspersed in different messages. But for both languages and the integration that you can actually focus on. The single language and switch between those is forthcoming. I don't have an estimate on that. I just want to say that it's on our radar to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "To do that. And there's currently not not everyone can edit those rooms, But PERSON5 said to me that a sufficient amount of people have that ability. So we need to the permissions down on that so that there's not a whole lot going on. And everyone is not just doing all 9 language all 9 target languages in a single room. Are over and using all of the workers at the same time. So is in that state that we promise, even though it was a bit late - And we have to fix a couple of minor things, But each we should be able to to send out if you have the spoken language in your profile set correctly to the language that practically speaking.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that we could download that for you. Yes.",
            "Okay, so that's great. So let's let's please do the demo right after this call. And now we're very optimistic that we could finish the call in 10 minutes from now. So we could we could then switch to the ORGANIZATION2. And I know that ORGANIZATION9 will be not connecting. Is there anyone else who is without Windows machine so who cannot see the demo? I hope that ORGANIZATION10 can stay there. Right? Are you -? Okay, that's good. And also, maybe if PERSON9 or PERSON10 can stay there for ORGANIZATION7. So that we know like what is the load on workers when when we run this demo.",
            "It works micro SSL.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that that's that's very good. So as of now, I'm quite optimistic. I I I cannot say at the moment yet, Whether I will take off the the milestone also for for this SLT and ORGANIZATION2. But after the demo, I'll I'll let you know when I think it it could be it could be done. That could be - That will be great.",
            "So what other operating sys. Sorry for barging in on. What are our operating systems are used like the Linux?",
            "We need we need Linux. We need Linux. Everybody need Linux.",
            "I think.",
            "I always borrow a a special Windows machine to make these calls. So I would also appreciate Linux. Okay, so here - So very good progress. We'll do demo after the call and decide if to kick it off.",
            "I'm just going to go out on a and so we do have Linux version. But you could use that for testing in this call. But I I think PERSON21 is already using it. So if you want to try that, we could give that to you. So please -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Tell me that information any further. It's on our radar, but we're working on it. But it's - Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's great. So I would I would like to get one and very probably two.",
            "Yeah, that would be useful, yeah. We have to install something I assume.",
            "Yes it's in that the package.",
            "Okay, yeah. It's no problem.",
            "Question would be - Do I have your e-mail address ans somehow so I can make you the upload anyway yet.",
            "You should -",
            "Let's just write it down into the ORGANIZATION11 doc.",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "Good idea. Good idea.",
            "So. And then PERSON17, if you can complete, so did I don't -",
            "Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll do that.",
            "Yeah, that's good to yeah.",
            "Okay, right.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "That's the reason why you must not that's that's that's the - So it's it's safe in this. Okay, so my last point is just a reminder of the deliverables. I'm not reminding ourselves of the deliverables dude the end of the year. But the one deliverable which might be of interest. Because it's very close to the view date is the 1 by the end of October. And the and that's your own test sets. So I would like to - If the if the deliverable is in good shape, I would like to sedn send it also to the reviewers on October 8th. It doesn't have to be complete, it can be just a draft. And I think it is in the reasonably well written shape already. So maybe we -",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "No, actually it's more or less at the moment. So there's -",
            "Okay.",
            "So there's a more ORGANIZATION8 document with sections for people to fill in -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Who I contacted a few weeks ago. Basically, nobody has done that yet, including myself. I haven't.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah.",
            "I need to I need to chase people. So it's a few different people need to contribute as fairly small amount of work.",
            "Do you want.",
            "Can we just consider them chase, now?",
            "A most of them are on this call.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "It's like the technical people like PERSON4 and -",
            "It's mostly yeah, it's mostly of.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Am I only is anybody okay the on the list in need to chase?",
            "I know actually not -",
            "Probably not.",
            "By ORGANIZATION7 on that work package, but if you if you know of something, then please to please to -",
            "There is there is one thing which would be great. And PERSON10 I remember you send me an email awhile ago. On the IWSLT evaluation campaign and I haven't got to that yet. But I think it would be good if we included a section on like plans, What to you do with these test sets. And that would be on on you then on PERSON10 for the IWSLT. So that's -",
            "One thing I'm wondering about, is that it's it's not work. But things so these have be English - Czech text translation task will be IWSLT this year but - Importantly, it's it wasn't I I I need to money, it wasn't need to be done. By, you know, wan't need done by PROJECT4 personal. But it was done because PROJECT4 and me had asked for it. I don't know how to spell it.",
            "Well, it's - I think it's good to like repackage it so that you will clearly say that this was done by ORGANIZATION6. But it fits the PROJECT4 set up. So we will also work with that. So it's not it's not clearly -",
            "Yeah, we can say, it was started by request of PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So there will be - So please - Yeah, maybe PERSON13, can you had the Overleaf link here? So that PERSON10 also sees the the link.",
            "Yes, oh, you'll find the email.",
            "Yeah, so that will be useful. And any case, we need to review this deliverable and the review should have ideally two weeks. So by mid October we should have the deliverable written. And then by the end of October submitted. So, okay. I don't see it as a realistic thing that we will have the deliverable by October 8. But the internal draft, finished draft should be ready by mid October, Which is one week more. And if that looks good, we can send it to the reviewers like shortly before the review. So that they see that the upcoming deliverable is in is in good shape.",
            "Okay, that sounds realistically.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So here is the already document. And I'll write down that internal deadline - mid October to accomplish internal review safely. Do we have an internal reviewer nominated for this are not yet? Deliverables - we don't have anyone reviewing this. So either it could be ORGANIZATION7 or it could be ORGANIZATION2. Or p ORGANIZATION10. ORGANIZATION10 is not much involved in the content right? I need someone technical, who will understand the importance of the test sets. And yet who is not contributing much to the deliverable. So who who could that be? Would that be rather ORGANIZATION2 or rather ORGANIZATION10? Or perhaps perhaps ORGANIZATION7?",
            "It except me because I don't think we have much time.",
            "I couldn't say anything about ORGANIZATION2. Not from - I don't even know what this is about.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Sorry.",
            "So so it seems like PERSON15 would be the best reviewer then.",
            "Well, actually, okay, yes. I myself or or? -",
            "Or you know what? You or PERSON2.",
            "I think PERSON2 maybe be suitable for this. I have to ask, of course.",
            "Well okay, yeah, yeah. So probably PERSON2 if she is not too opposed. Okay.",
            "It should be a short deliverable, right?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, so it shouldn't be that hard to - I mean - Yeah. Not so much work to review it.",
            "Okay. And my question, my last point in the agent is something. Which I realized that I wanted to ask as well. If PERSON10 has any news on the Tedx event in Tren event in Trento.",
            "We have no update on the site, so -",
            "Yeah, so so pro yeah. So yeah, I ask wrong I ask the wrong person. I meant I meant ORGANIZATION10 yeah, sorry.",
            "Okay, sorry. Yeah, I have literally no update on that. I can not say anything. I am not - Let's say I'm not negotiating this in person and I have no report, yeah, sorry.",
            "Yeah, so it was - The idea was to run it like on the fringe of Tedx with no direct link, With the Tedx organizers just like being in front of their room. And then doing the subtitling in many languages and going from Italian. But that was an idea by PERSON22 and PERSON2. So neither of them is available. So PERSON15, please check with them if there is any update, Please, let us know as soon as possible because it's mid November, But still it involves travel and set up. So there will be some work. Some preparation is necessary for that and LOCATION1 ASR will be needed. Which is.",
            "So so my question would be, can we - You had or ORGANIZATION10 has an ASR we can use? Because I mean the Italian - We fused that in the past. The most all we have.",
            "We certainly have Italian ASR. So. We have a few running on mediator I think. Well, I I have to ask. Oh, well, or if shouldn't be a huge problem to use our translators, transcriptors sorry. Yeah and I am aware that time is running out about Tedx, but we are still trying to. It's quite difficult actually to to get information from the organizators so - I was struggling to.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thought, taken the notes on this. So is there anything else that we need to discuss? I don't think that that's -",
            "Just one quick.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To operate IWSLT, I need to discuss what we would like to propose for the next evaluation. We have work team. At the end of October in Hong Kong where the student committee will take place. Plus, the evaluation will be very early next year because it will be - It's not going to be in conjunction with other because IWSLT it's going to be in.",
            "I think you were talking about first quarter next year.",
            "Yeah -",
            "I'm going to see. So the the I have the camera I have open here. The camera ready for ASL is - Sorry, the workshop papers are due in April. Yeah. Okay so -",
            "Just one. Okay, here we go so -",
            "So we are gone.",
            "So they they want to have that ACL, exactly in Seattle - And ACL in Seattle is going to happen -",
            "In July.",
            "In July so that means for the evaluation campaign, I mean, we can keep the evaluation. So we have to stick with the paper deadlines by then?",
            "More or less yes. I mean, we've managed to push them back before two weeks maybe. It can be - About it.",
            "Yeah. So suddenly - And yeah, the beginning of July, July 5th. So we could do a deadline for the evaluation by end of May or something like that. I mean, the the scientific papers are nice. Maybe we can negotiate with them, but they are technical papers for the system descriptions can be some later. But but nonetheless, it's going to be much earlier next year than it was this year.",
            "Yeah. So they so this is already set. It's already fixed that the IWSLT -",
            "It's applied, yes, yes, yes.",
            "It's applied in that way. Yes. So if they accept it, it will be in Seattle in July. And did I understand correctly that the evaluation week would be by at the end of May right?",
            "No, I think it's -",
            "Or earlier?",
            "Or earlier. So the thing is if we have to stick with the paper submission deadlines, That means that by the end of April, things would have to be submitted.",
            "Yeah, for PROJECT3 we're looking at an evaluation. We we're with the MLP, we hope. But we're looking at evaluation week at the end of May, beginning of June.",
            "Okay, so -",
            "We should do beginning of June.",
            "Remember that -",
            "I mean, sorry?",
            "That there is the ORGANIZATION1 Congress.",
            "There is the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. I just saw that at my calendar.",
            "But I think we're - Yeah. Our evaluation week is going to be around, then I don't know. Maybe we can have a little bit later.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's probably PROJECT3 question. I don't know. But -",
            "Yeah.",
            "There is a potential collision there. I don't know if it's a serious collision.",
            "But same way IWSLT evaluation have sometimes.",
            "Spring, yeah.",
            "So that they would directly help us for the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. And this is something that I would like to see as as a bonus. So could we do this? So what what is a set of languages and tasks covered there? And this is very much linked to the to the test test sets that we are packaging. Just well for the end of October.",
            "So basically, essentially, it will be whatever we will decide the next steering committee meeting at the end of October. And I will be the what in that meeting and -",
            "Okay.",
            "Advertise and push for whatever we decided by then and what I can offer. And that's why I also put PERSON6 in CC. Because PERSON6 can also help to for whatever we would like have for PROJECT4. And then of course, steering committee members that might have other plans.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we'll see what we can.",
            "So it's important for me to respond to that email -",
            "Exactly.",
            "And like, yeah,.",
            "And we n we need to coordinate, to make sure. That when I travel to Hong Kong end of October, That I have a package with me that I can present to them. As you know, PROJECT4 has the same time would like to do with this Asia. And I don't know, maybe we can help with and data preparation and stuff like that. That makes an for interesting case. We can also maybe promise participation from the consortium. That's also we could argument if we know that we will have participants.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So we'll I'll keep an eye on this and I'll make sure. That we'll make use of IWT IW IWSLT in the best way that we can. Okay, so that's that's important, thanks. Any other of new pieces of information or things to consider? If not, then I would like to thank everybody for joining this call. Remember the deadlines in the very few days from now, The dissemination and the and the publications. And any any edits that you would like to do or for the progress report. Please keep checking your emails, be responsive. Because we will need to ask you maybe if or of some financial issues. Or some clarification issues in in the report when we are reviewing it. So please, please respond. We'll be submitting all these things in a week from now. And now let's let's switch over to the ORGANIZATION2. So so maybe can can ORGANIZATION2 still paste the link to somewhere. At the top of this ORGANIZATION11 doc or - Yeah. So thanks for everybody. And I'll keep running this ORGANIZATION3 call until I'm able to also start the ORGANIZATION2 call. But we are officially closed here and we are moving to the ORGANIZATION2 to see the demo.",
            "All right. So the the link that is in the minutes in for Wednesday, August 28th. At at the second page of that ORGANIZATION11 doc.",
            "Okay.",
            "That is still active. You can still use that.",
            "Okay.",
            "To join. Hello see you soon.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And as in a few more minutes to send you to the Linux version of ORGANIZATION2, But it should be there in a few minutes.",
            "Okay. Still I just -"

            "Hello.",

            "Participants, oh. Yeah. So let's wait for while, until, others join in. Let's review the document in the meantime, mm-hmm. So actually Be PERSON34 as I see here -",
            "How bad, mistake was that with the deadline of manual annotation for PROJECT1? I think -",
            "Yeh, you aren't really asking the right person here.I don't know in in a sense that - After the annotations done, somebody got to analyze them. And that person is hopefully not me, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then somebody's gonna try them up again. That's hopefully not me. And that really needs to be done on time for the conference. I think last time we had like the day before the conference.",
            "Yes, yes -",
            "So we don't want to be any later than that.",
            "But the term -",
            "But the conference is -",
            "Is on Saturday this Saturday.",
            "Yeah, and the conference is in November right?",
            "Yeah, in eighteenth or so -",
            "Eighteenth, yes.",
            "So it's is probably still time that we get the annotations done for the twentieth. I mean we're just just so late this year for -",
            "For everything. So, so well, actually -",
            "Yeah -",
            "We don't need the full twentieth. But I I would find it stupid if I e-mail the annotators today that they have only just a few days.",
            "Sure, okay.",
            "I think we'll going until the whatever the eighteenth would be definitely,, good. And the fifteenth for example would be also better than the twentieth.",
            "Either scheme is probably fine, because I mean there is going to be some people who slept.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So - Well, you know, but I guess who's who is actually analyzing this data I mean - PERSON16 knows how to do it. But he's keep vanishing, so hopefully PERSON15, or PERSON12 will pick it up.",
            "Okay, and PERSON7 is on the - Is PERSON7 going to do any, analysis?",
            "Yeah. So PERSON7, but PERSON7 seems to be taking care of the, the crowd source part.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the part for the research is run by the PERSON16 with now his assistants PERSON12 and PERSON15.",
            "And PERSON7 is like separately doing the crowd source staff. I mean I suppose these got to be put together. So I don't know, who does the final putting together -",
            "And PERSON7 is often involved so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think she should be asked as well.",
            "Yeah, so I'll ask PERSON7 as well as -",
            "So PERSON17, why do I appear as in two three four packs?",
            "Yeah, because you have entered that as as your name.",
            "Probably you entered that twice. I don't know, yeah.",
            "It's once. I will try that again. I don't know. I'll mayby try video and -",
            "Yeah, okay. So we have we have ORGANIZATION15. We have ORGANIZATION3, through PERSON6. I don't know if PERSON19 is also - And PERSON10 as well. I don't 'know if PERSON19 is joining. PERSON6, do you know?",
            "So, I don't know.",
            "Okay. Yeah, so we'll we'll see. So, anyway, hello everybody. It's it's great that you're here. So we also have, ORGANIZATION11, represented as of PERSON10 and PERSON34 is reconnecting. And then we have ORGANIZATION8. Do we have ORGANIZATION8? PERSON1 yes. And we have ORGANIZATION10 PERSON22 and and I guess this Me is PERSON33 from ORGANIZATION5. So actually we we have all the partners represented. So that's great. Let's, get started again. We have a number of, new people,, and some of those are, connected. So, one of them is PERSON32, PERSON8, who is, who has been employed by ORGANIZATION15. But he is still, abroad because he cannot travel, to the, Czech Republic yet. Due to Covid restrictions. So hopefully that will, sort out, and we have more such people. For these, new people I would like to, like remind everybody again. And and and, and percify you, still at the same time that we are recording these calls for the purposes of automatic meeting summarization. Those who are on the call for, on the project for longer period of time have already filled their consent form some months ago. But we're going to get back to you, to all again with these consent forms after the we have done various processing of of this. And before we do any any release of the data whatsoever. So you will have your second say on on whether we can use this data in things like shared tasks on summarization. And we will get back to that, during the call. So if anybody object the prime recording as such, please let me know. But otherwise, I assume that you at least give us the permission to process it,. And then we will refine the details, what, what else can be done with that. Okay. So, it seems that we have everybody here. Thanks again, for joining, this call. And, let's quickly proceed according to the agenda. I'm happy to see that most of you have, filled in, the progress report of your work packages. So while I'm talking - While I'm talking,, if you still have not filled the details such as work package two, Please scroll the document and and fill what what is the current status. And I'll start at the top the pros-progress report. Update the pdf, and send it, very soon to the project officer. Our review was excellent in in short. But still there number of things that we need to fix. So,, there are two recommendations. I take the second one, on ourselves. We need to specify what basic research advances are going to be integrated and, not. And specify the procedure to select them. Third the answer that are write into the report will be will based will base it on the PROJECT2 test set. The regular testing of the pipelines and, the he the video capacity of the teams,, in in in integrating their components. So, the the general idea is that everybody should try to not only develop the systems for research papers. But also wrap them and include them as workers. As soon as they are used as workers, we will evaluate them on the common common settings in the PROJECT2 test set. And then based on their performance, we will or will not use them. So for everybody this means that, yes, please try integrating. It is not that difficult, and, s we will take care of the of the selection based on the PROJECT2 test set. So that's recommendation number two. And recommendation number one, is, er, more specific,, summary of the of the publications. So,, ORGANIZATION3 can you, can you improve the wording around the lifelong learning there?",
            "I can not speak to that. I am not involved there.",
            "Yeah, so is it only PERSON19? Or do you have another eheh, someone, else on the team? Is life-long learning -",
            "Could be PERSON10?",
            "Could be, maybe.",
            "They this.",
            "Yeah, I I I mean for life-long learning it's mostly PERSON19 but, yeah I will check with team.",
            "Yeah, so please make sure that we respond to this. Because, as soon as they mention something exclusively, we really have to respond to that. And if they don't not mention it, still they these are s examples. So everybody should check, that, the progress report is kind of self contained. That you don't have to open the papers to see what they're about. So everybody should check their that their papers are are covered somewhat. And then the second explicit, remark is the multitasking, in the end-to-end ASR with language model has not worked. I do not know if this was, ORGANIZATION3 work, or if it was done by a student of mine PERSON25. I've asked PERSON25, so I'll hopefully get response from him, but maybe from ORGANIZATION3. If there is only you or, on us.",
            "It it doesn't work because - I mean we, I mean the we know that, the the end-to-end ASR also have I mean, part of it - It doing the language modelling.",
            "So yeah, in in case it doesn't input much with the isolation of language model than need. It is asked to. We had to find other ways and maybe it, caught in in PROJECT2 that people also report less more input than with with -",
            "Integration of language model. But yeah, it can be that case that they do a lot of fine tuning of - For some specific -",
            "Data test. But I mean, to me - I I tried to experiment with some data set we have and it seems that language models doesn't have.",
            "Yeah. So the general idea is that you have end-to-end ASR and you train a part of the model for the, language modeling task alone. And you run that in multitasking with the speech recognition task as well, right? And then the benefit of this, additional task, the language modeling task is not, not, big, right? So maybe -",
            "So -",
            "Maybe maybe that was,, please check with PERSON19. Because it could have been the case that PERSON19 said this just, in the discussion. And maybe they would like the reviewers would like to, to have this in the report.",
            "Okay.",
            "I don't I don't know what were the details. So so please, I'll I'll check with PERSON25, but PERSON10,, please check, with PERSON19.",
            "Yeah. I I here it I also not we call it multitasking and and what why is multitasking here it it -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, I will check it.",
            "Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay. So. Here PERSON17 will check with PERSON25. I'm actually already doing that. Yeah. Then, yeah, we need to correct the plot. And, so this is, this is the progress report. Please, PERSON10, confirm to us once your parts are done. Everybody have a look at that again, and check, your publications an we'll submit the report. For example at the end of this week, right? So PERSON18, please make sure.",
            "To ensure that we submit the updated version on Friday. So that it's reserve.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. And I've skipped this greyed out part because PERSON29 has already done it. And it is on the massively multilingual mission translation with random big translation for unseen languages. I think this the paper by a ORGANIZATION11, but PERSON29 has already resolved that. So if you want to check what's what's there please do so. We also got some recommendations for future work. So this is something that, we only have to keep in mind, in the coming months. So when collecting a document level data,, and also,, yeah, the multilingual data. Di do the both, that's what they want to say. So, preserve documents, also in multilingual data collections. This is what, we are doing. And also,, for everybody when review collecting data make sure which are available data on gender and nationally or I would actually say mother tongue here. So when you when you have, access to this data,, when you er, are collecting anything be it from the web, just re-packaging, or creating your own collections, even for test sets - Please please record that. So that's for everybody involved in work package one. Then, we have a recommendation, again on the joint papers. So we reported two research papers that were by many or all of the partners in the consortium. And actually, I realized only after the review that we also had a two page paper on TAMT. So, we we got three. But this is going to be reported in,, the, like in in sum for the whole project, and it's not not a big difference. It's not a big paper anyway. So, yeah. So, we are definitely going to try the ACL demo. The ACL demo submission deadline has been finally set. It's as late as January, mid-January next year. And I think it's a better, goal than trying to make it regular paper, which would be due tomorrow. So if you are fine with that, that's okay. If you would still think that we should try to get at the regular joint paper about whatever the architecture of, of PROJECT2 subtitling pipeline, then please get in touch with me very quickly. But otherwise I'll just plan to, submit the ACL demo as an demo in January. Yeah. So then, the the question is how to make sure that we have some, papers on collaboration in the in the, for the rest of the project. So I would like to ask everybody to propose collaborations. And actually, start them. And I'm only mentioning the research partners, but it doesn't have to be so -",
            "By any means. So, also, if if ORGANIZATION10 or ORGANIZATION8 see any opportunity, for collaboration, on papers, or other tangible and measurable results. Then just suggest that. So this can, let's take ORGANIZATION8 as an as an example here. I think that, the, EU would be definitely happy if we, had papers even on like an non-CL non competition to conferences and the venue. So PERSON1 just disappeared, but,, but I'll we'll get back to them again. And, we'll ask if they have other conferences or venues where they - Whether is some option to publish whatever angle of PROJECT2 technologies, and then having some research partners contributing to that would definitely satisfy the requirement, from, the reviewers. And similarly for ORGANIZATION10, if you're doing any research, on whatever aspect like whatever improving your pipelines for your other, other projects. And inclu you would like to include, the ORGANIZATION3 segmentation or other things, then, please, propose that. So if you have anything in, in mind, that could be such a case, PERSON22 please please put it here.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah. So so, here I'll put it with a big ORGANIZATION10 some plus some research partner,, mhmh, some joint experiment or whatever. And PERSON1 is back. So I'll just say it again. PERSON1, are you - Can you can hear me?",
            "Now I can hear you yes. I had problems.",
            "Yes. Yeah, yeah. So what I was saying, is that these joint publications do not have to be limited to the research partners. So you the the the you know venues which are relevant for your audience -",
            "Mhmh.",
            "And if you see any option any, any opportunity for joint paper with you being the main one. And some of the research partners, contributing whatever, some, some like -",
            "Case study, or or whatever. Then please initiate that. So.",
            "Okay.",
            "So there could be like ORGANIZATION8 plus some research partner writing, e.g. some case,, studies. So if you had,,, customer, who is using your platform. And they would agree to do some experiment on, which approach to spoken language translation, or whatever is better fit for their particular domain. Then get in touch with us, or ORGANIZATION11 and or ORGANIZATION3 or whoever you like, and and, conduct such an experiment. That would definitely be what we are asked for.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. So that's it and I actually propose some of those. So the one, thing is that we have the SLTF, PERSON3 is submitting the ILS ELSL paper tomorrow, I'm editing it. And we started some discussion with with PERSON34.",
            "But can we -",
            "Can we early enough.",
            "Yeah. I I'm it seems a bit late for me to make meaningful contribution.",
            "Yeah. Well, that's our fault as well.",
            "Like -",
            "No no no. It's not -",
            "So we'll see. So we'll we'll - I'll I'll definitely do the revision. If you have some time, I know it's extremely like late notice, I'll share the link with you, and you'll decide, how much you can you can do there. And then, well, we can easily get rejected anyway.",
            "Oh that's - Easy, yes.",
            "So if we get rejected -",
            "Okay.",
            "So as as you wish. So I'll I'll send the link to you. You'll have a look and -",
            "Okay.",
            "And and then you'll see how much you can contribute and if it makes sense to you. And, if you do some, reasonable changes -",
            "I think many can be done. Then yes, then we would have a joint paper. So -",
            "Okay.",
            "So, so PERSON3 wants to know from me, definitely by, tomorrow, what is the authors' list, but, -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And yeah. So sorry about that it's mu - I feel bad about like forgetting -",
            "No don't feel.",
            "About you know,.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So then the other thing that we have in mind is this minuting shared task planning. PERSON32 has contacted j you PERSON34 and also PERSON19.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I do not know if there is any progress on that,, on this collaboration -",
            "No, there is not any progress. I'm just -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, we have come back to that -",
            "In order -",
            "And I see PERSON6 - Yeah, and I see PERSON6 -",
            "Is also, doing domething. So PERSON6, could you briefly summarize because PERSON32 is also here.",
            "Well, I have only just recently started as the professor Wibel asked me to change the priorities.",
            "Because we also want to have minuting for our lecture transcription.",
            "Mhmh.",
            "So I have only just recently started looking into it. And right now, working on on some baseline system.",
            "Yes, so this is -",
            "Going to be like something publication we - in the in the very near future, but -",
            "Yeah, that's not a -",
            "Yeah, that's that's not a problem that like it's I also see that's very like starting exploration. Because it is so hard, to to create some reasonable minutes, and to evaluate them is equally hard. That it will take some time until we get something usable. Are you, involved in another EU project, which has these micro projects, or not?",
            "I guess it's not -",
            "No no. That's probably another one. Because there also like, someone proposed this minuting as, as activity in one of this network EU project.",
            "So it can be ELG.",
            "Is it ELG?",
            "No.",
            "No,, it's -",
            "No, one more. Okay, someone else. Okay. Sorry.",
            "It's even even someting else. Something new. And, so I thought that maybe PERSON26, like change these priorities because of that project. But it sounds very, plausible that he did just for the purposes of the lecture, translator yeah. So that's - So in any case,, if I understand correctly. You are, looking at, s probably abstractive summarization, which takes the full transcript and somehow makes is shorter, right? And -",
            "That is that is the the goal. So at this very moment since PERSON30 asked me to start the last Friday, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "You haven't finished yet.",
            "The the idea was first to have the the possible system that does work.",
            "That I can back up in a week that right now is an extractive system -",
            "Okay.",
            "Then I'm gonna try to extract at least subsentences and not like full sentences. Because the system that I that I have now is quite biased towards long sentences.",
            "Because the long sentences contain more terms and so will make structures on long sentences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that's gonna be the first version.",
            "Then probably I'm gonna look into, published paper that does the abstractive summarization with hierarchical transformer. Gonna see how that works -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If I can reproduce that and then we can see how it.",
            "Yeah, and do you have any training data for that?",
            "They trained on the on the ORGANIZATION13 and PROJECT3.",
            "ICS.",
            "Corpuses as well as pretraining on, summarization. So on -",
            "Yeah. On. So that's the same data sets that we, are aware of and working with. So that's that's good. So,, so we have a mailing list called minute at ORGANIZATION6. And, our team on minuting is already like geographically very much spread around the world. So if you think it would make sense, than we could include you into this. They are quite active.",
            "So you would you would find your, mail box, possibly not Friday no - They are actually more in the regular calls. So they make, almost daily calls. That's because we want to have the team - Because they are like physically,, around the world. We want to make them, collaborating team. And for that we have these regular call there. And sometimes long when the discussion is, important. But often is just like a check up call, so that we don't lose these remote members. So, we could include you, into this, and, and then, you are definitely with your experiments, and the system, the baseline that you go to your in a great position to also either provide baselines or take part in the shared task that PERSON32 is supervising the preparations of. So next year, we plan to have a shared task, on meeting summarization, and -",
            "SLT or -",
            "E,, n well, PERSON32, can you say, can you hear us? Can you say what is the timeline, what ist the the planned venue?",
            "Okay, hi. Can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, wonderful. Hi, hi everyone. So this is PERSON32 and I am mostly invested in the meeting summarization part and taking care of the shared task. So, the plan is that we would be submitting a proposal winter speech, twenty twenty one and the and the call for proposals would come, somewhat in November. And if the speech next year will be it will be in Brno Eurocity Czech. And, and and like we have thought of initially four tasks. But for the first shared task we will be going for three. So that fourth task will be definitely the meeting summarization when so where we have the meeting transcripts and the corresponding minutes annotated by the annotators. And we need to find that, we need to see that how neural system can generate the meetings. But our initial experiments are like we are using the are not very much attractive. You know, but now we are working on some other semantic metrix like word sum and in all those metrix. So,, possibly we'll be able to evaluate, the the summaries, by the end of this month. And have a complete the study how the other different metrix are working on on our data. And we are also like train the model on CNN and because the data is very less. So, yeah, fine tuning the data on our on our training data and then. So this is the plan.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So -",
            "So so the high level - Thank you PERSON32. So the high-level, overview is that we are aiming for workshop at interspeech. And, with the data set for the shared task will be a combination of, the data that we are collecting, which needs to be synonymised, so names removed. And also the consents from the participants recollected for that. And we or also probably should put there some of standard data sets as like a secondary test set. So the for example, the ORGANIZATION13 corpus, and we would see the difference, in performances, across, these test sets. And, we are doing the the preparations and we are running our own baseline, systems. But I find it very useful, if you PERSON6 could also run, your systems on our data. At least the the few test, items that that we are now working with. So,,, so if if your baseline starts doing something, by the end of this week. So that you ha, make PERSON26 happy. Then please also make us happy as well and run it also on our data sets, and we will see how how bad it performs. It is very likely, it will perform bad out of the domain, because the ORGANIZATION13 corpus, is is like specific so to say. And -",
            "Testing on on our meeting data.",
            "Okay, so -",
            "That was my test set to begin with.",
            "So what is - What do you mean by our meeting data?",
            "Well, we have - I have the the transcripts of our meetings -",
            "And for the test set.",
            "Oh, okay. So then you are essentially using the, the that you're doing the same as we are. But you don't have anything like the manual transcripts tha the manual ASR corrections, that PERSON2 is doing. So yes, we're we're -",
            "I don't know the other ones who are in the meeting experimentation, minuting experimentation.",
            "Okay, yes. So you are only collaborating because we need to. Yeah,",
            "I don't know, I just use whatever data is in there, so you know.",
            "As a PROJECT2 -",
            "And we have it was for a reform.",
            "It's PROJECT2 private report?",
            "Is this the PROJECT2 test set?",
            "Sorry for interruption.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON6, didn't I send you the whole, data set?",
            "You send an e-mail saying that it's on your servers. And that -",
            "So you didn't the whole - Aha. Should I send it to you?",
            "Er -",
            "So I think -",
            "Okay.",
            "I think it would be better if PERSON6, served as the test person for, what will be the release for the shared task. So, it's like yes, PERSON6 you are part of the consortium. And the consents that we have so far allow us to, to use these data within the consortium. But please, take it very like sensitive, but at the same time I think that it would be great if you were revising what we are preparing for task itself. So,, t you should then re-run your systems again. And also tell us whatever is wrong with the data and - So that's there will be a a fair amount of work still to get the the proper,, the training and development such, release. But it would be great if you could, review that. Review the final release. So for now use what you have, but also please, keep in your to do list to do the revision of of the data. So that we have like, guinea pig, test person to to see whether we are, preparing the task in a sensible way.",
            "And if it's possible. I would still want whatever full data we have available, including the the audio -",
            "Mhmh.",
            "Just for the purpose. The project will not last forever and we would want to have that data available. For the project as well -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, some of the consents do not allow that. So we we need to be very careful about that, so PERSON2 - We know that some people said that they, th data has to be deleted with the end of the project. And we we want to like honour that. So, PERSON2 this is an urgent call for, the the meta data improvement that we we were discussing this on Monday. So that's actually yesterday with PERSON11, another collegaue of ours. And we really should do this properly and make sure that you, also, that that partners in the consortium use the data, as as the data providers allowed, us to do and not more. So please take that in mind. So PERSON6 what you have now, please use it. But be very careful, and, we'll refine the meta data very soon. And we'll let you know what is what has been allowed by by whom.",
            "I hear there are some problems with this is the meeting corpus,",
            "W s well, yes, we can call a meeting or so what -",
            "I If I kind of and about issues on the PROJECT4 part -",
            "Yes, yes, yes. I can actually -",
            "Now we're coming to that -",
            "We're coming to that in ethics. So if you scroll down.",
            "I can briefly say what has happened in in ethics so far.",
            "Sorry sorry.",
            "Let's let's discuss it at the moment. Because it's it's very very relevant. So, first thing I think I may have already mentioned that. We will have one person working on ethics from the high level, point of view, so compliances, regulation. So this, does colleague of ours, is still busy with other projects. But from, January or somewhat later, but not much later, she would be available for PROJECT2. And she is happy, to read all the regulations. She is already doing that. So she she actually has fun in reading these, these these regulations, and she'll, make sure that we follow them in what we are doing. So that the proper treatment will come after, January. But that actually, how how does this timing, run compared to the shared asked timing? PERSON32, by when do we have to release the data for the shared task participants?",
            "Hello, yeh?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, if, so if the thing is like if the deadline is in November -",
            "So the the notification would be come would be coming sometime January. And I think, probably we have to release the first trial data in March.",
            "Yeah, So March gives us like February, before the final touches. So the internal plan -",
            "Yeah, so March will be maybe yeah - March will be maybe the trial data when we release the data for -",
            "The practice of the participants. And maybe the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Full training data would be one month later. We can fix that. Maybe in.",
            "Release some trial data in March - So this is still doable. So what we are doing, w t now, is planning how to do the the identification. So the removal of people's names,, and that will happen, in during the autumn and and early winter. And, this ideally would we do it right at this first shot. And when in January this colleague revises what we are doing. She will say, okay, you are doing good. But she can also say, you still need to remove this and this from the data. And then we have at least the month to do that on on subsamples to release the trial data, according to this, these corrected rules. And then some more months, you do it in full. So, we are, yeah, we'll we'll do our best to, to do it properly already now, in autumn. But still there is time to recover from any mistakes. And then - So the what happened at this PROJECT4 call was that there were new people again. At the beginning of the call I asked whether they are fine with us recording that. And then they, said, well, no, because they don't want want that for various reasons.",
            "And I when I was describing like why we are why we would like to record that I also mentioned that we are planning to run shared task with, the data.",
            "And this is what like upset PERSON5 about, the like publishing the data. PERSON2 have you checked what has PERSON5 filled in his answer? Because if he has already sent to, us, at the beginning when we were asking that he requires us to use the data only within the project PROJECT2. Yes, we will obey that. So actually his his contributions to the goal were already excluded, by then. So, s we need to check what he has, what he has writen up. And also,,, I agree that people do not always realize all the consequences of the consents when they are giving the consents.",
            "And we don't want to misuse this. We don't want to abuse their, their approval. Because if they didn't know what they are agreeing with, then they will definitely like get back to us once they find out the data in the public. And say, oh, you have abused my consent. And we do not want that, so so -",
            "We we don't have him.",
            "Oh, so he didn't respond. Yes, that's like not giving, not give consent -",
            "It's no consent.",
            "Consent.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I suppose there is the concept of this case of being after withdraw your consent -",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "At a later date.",
            "Exactly. And we want to - Yes, that obviously, can apply in our case. And for that, we actually prefer the people to withdraw the consent before we release their part.",
            "If they if they yeah. If they want to withdraw it,, they, will withdraw it later, and that will cause more more burden and more complication. So - And if they, if they approved, if they like give the consent again, when actually what is the data like, then there is big hope that they are not going to withdraw it afterwards. They still, according to the the GDPR or EU regulation - They have the right to withdraw the consent at any later stage. But if they approve it at the w like while looking at the actual release, then there is a big hope that they will not withdraw the consent later on.",
            "Yeh, yeah, yeah.",
            "So that's that's the strategy that we that we want to take. So,, I, really want to, go as individual as necessary,, because the data set would otherwise shrink too much. So if someone says that -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't want to be included. I would like to have the technical means to remove this particular person and keep the rest included.",
            "And this can really happen in practical situations as well. I I can imagine that, someone such as ORGANIZATION8 would be running, the this remote conferencing platform. And people would, say,, yes, I'm happy to be recorded for the purposes of meeting summarization, and someone else. Some other channel will say no,, my data can only be life shipped to the participants. But it must not be processed offline in in any way by by anyone. And then the models, have also be the ready for, a situation where there is no input coming from someone. And people are referring to some missing content. So, it is. It is really conceivable that this situation would happen in practice.",
            "So what happens I mean, if we have a three party meeting conversations. There three parties in the meeting and then one person withdraw some consent. So then we are shipping as data, which has two parts as a three-party meeting, but there is one channel missing.",
            "Yes. This would be the goal.",
            "So it makes - I mean, how valuable is that for summarization? I mean - 'cause - I guess - I mean, I guess is, what we have to do with it, but it seems -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It - Yeah. It seems that especially if it's, you know, kind of core nature of that project.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "He is he is as speaking more is.",
            "Yeah,, obviously we it can end up by us losing all the PROJECT4 data. Because PERSON5 was, like mention saying at least the word in every sentence, even by sentence by someone else. So it is possible that all the data would be would be excluded then. That will be unfortunate, but yes, but we have to obey. There is no,, no other way. Maybe we can, like still convince PERSON5 that if it's anonymized,, and if it's text only, which like as soon as you include audio. There is no technical way of do of doing, full anonymization. The voice is simply recognizable. That's like full stop.",
            "So -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So if it's if it's text only and if it's anonymized even by, like removing named entities,, such as ORGANIZATION4, or, or PROJECT4 itself these names. Then I still think it will be relevant for the summarization task, because it's a placeholder. So j-j like if you if you relabel the named entities, the will appear in the summaries as well as in the transcript.",
            "Mhmh.",
            "So the system will learn to work with these placeholders and it will, it should work the same way with any other placeholders. So I think that the data would be valuable. And the goal now our, the, the coming autumn months is to do this synonymization. It is synonymization, it's not full anonymization,. Yeah,, I don't want to, h, add the defintion of anynomization versus synonymization at the moment, but yeah, there is. So,, with this processing of the data for which we have former intern appointed kind of. This PERSON11, with the data synonymized we would get back to all the participants. We would show them. This is what the data looks like at the moment. Can you please think about your consent again and and hopefully give it to us. And then in what, t what extend. Whether we can use it only within the project, or whether we can actually really publish it, for the shared task or whether we, can publish it with some delay. There is also another another acces of that. And and that is that we cannot release it publicly. But we can release it, to participants who registered themselves for a particular opportunity. So if there is a shared task, we would, be allowed to use the data, but the data could be given only with the the participants signing a license. You are free to use this data for this shared task and delete it after the shared task. So that's another access which we do not have covered in the consent form at the moment. But I'm seriously considering that as well. So this is for negotiation, even with people like PERSON5. What types of access do we need,, so that they can give the consent and are happy with that. Yeah. So, so that is a like, it seems as a very big complication. But I see it only as a fair complication. It has, the ethics, is an issue. And our project has been asked to handle it, and to serve as an example. So let's do it the best way we can. And, at the same time to the benefit of of the research community. So, if you also have anyone, in in your teams who, could have opinions on that, or who could help us, please join. Otherwise we'll proceed ourselves. And, I hope that I will not PERSON5 much with this topic, so that he would still be responding to my questions about about that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So if you see -",
            "He technically has opinions.",
            "Yes. He technically has opinions.",
            "He technically has opinions about that.",
            "Yeah but, but I would like these opinions to, well, how to put it. To like, search t-to include our search for way which is useful for -",
            "Be constructive.",
            "Can be constructive, yeah.",
            "Constructive, yes.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, I see.",
            "So if you if you -",
            "See him in person, I don't know if you if you still go to offices these days in in ORGANIZATION11.",
            "No.",
            "So, but anyway, if that happens somewhere on the on the on the the fields. Then then please explain to him, what is our intention and that will definitely get back to him. Show him, the examples of what the the what the release could look like if he approves that. And hopefully he'll he'll agree ol or he will propose in the constructive way further restrictions on the release so that he could give the approval.",
            "Mhmh. Okay.",
            "Yeah. So that's that's fair yeah, sorry for taking that much time on the single minuting topic. But I think it's, very, yeah, so. Hi PERSON6 - Yeah, so you have discussed something in in the in the document. I hope that you are, in in touch. So, I mean, PERSON6 and PERSON32 and, now PERSON2 and so on. So let's move on with the rest of the call. So one more, possible collaboration that I see is between ORGANIZATION15 and ORGANIZATION3 on the end-to-end spoken language translation. I have sent an e-mail to PERSON6 and PERSON19 this morning. So that's because PERSON25 is,, like, definitely going to work on end-to-end SLT. And he's also applying for some travel grant for and if he gets that, ORGANIZATION3 could be a good destination for him. So, if, if you agree. I think it would be good that even before this potential internship, to start some collaboration. So if you can come up with any experiment that could be done jointly,, PERSON6 or PERSON10 say so, get PERSON25 involved. Obviously an PROJECT2 paper coming out of that would be, what we're what we're asked for beginning. Yeah, so, then recommendation number three, and let's. We were really running out of time. So we will probably skip the updates of the work packages, but that's not too big a problem. The recommendation number three is that we really have to have the mitigation plan. For the case when there is no EUROSAI congress at all. I haven't heard a single word from PERSON33 on this call. So maybe he doesn't have any microphone at all. But if he is around if he can say, there may be some news, but there also are probably no news, the equally likely. So they the the this ORGANIZATION5 may decide to run the Congress in the like online space. Or they may decide to cancel it altogether, whatever. So, we should have some other possible fora. So I think that it was meta forum that we suggested during the review. I might be wrong with this. And then PERSON19 reminded us that this is English only.",
            "And I don't feel that as a as a big problem, because there are people who, like,, k come from many different, the language setting. So they could evaluate how well it it works for their language.",
            "Obviously, there will be much, they will be sufficient fluent in English. Otherwise, they would not take part in that, in the original conference anaway. But it would be a good test case for us, at least, and, maybe you can come up with other, other proposals as well. So please everybody think about, your well, high school classmates. And other neighbors, like people outside of the of the competition linguistics domain who run some relevant,, events. And think about, if we could get in touch with them. And if we could test PROJECT2 technology at at these like substitutes for the ORGANIZATION12 Congress.",
            "What about ORGANIZATION2?",
            "The parliament itself -",
            "That's, yes, we could do that. I know that there the ORGANIZATION2 is actually, running a tender, to provide that on commercial basis. So we well maybe ORGANIZATION3 knows also about htis. But, we didn't take part in that, tender in the end, because well, our technology is not - And we don't have the people to, to do -",
            "To do it on, the on the business level, but,",
            "With - I mean, I I can see it's unlikely they would like this go in full parliament session. But with the reasons out sights, meetings, scripts that we could -",
            "We could look into. That's something the project officer could help us with, isn't it? Because they are back into.",
            "Possibly -",
            "In the ORGANIZATION14 -",
            "Possibly -",
            "ORGANIZATION14 is finding this project, the ORGANIZATION14 should -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Maybe be at help.",
            "Yeah, except that I think this is the ORGANIZATION7 and the ORGANIZATION7 fight -",
            "Well.",
            "With the -",
            "I got confused by the all.",
            "The organisations. Understood.",
            "But, but still, I would still call the project officer, and see if they have any -",
            "Suggestions. Yeah, meta forum is a - Is good, because you you got an audience who is sympathetic to technology.",
            "And is interested in technology. The problem is is very artificial situation. 'Cause goes around understands English pretty well.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So it's it's sort of, yeah. It - But as an experimental platform it's -",
            "It's not a bad idea.",
            "Yeah. So which, well I have -",
            "So -",
            "I haven't been to meta forum myself, PERSON34 you have. And I actually -",
            "I yeah.",
            "I was silent - I was silent about the call for this year.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But I think we should again - We should again do something about it.",
            "I don't know -",
            "I suppose it otherwise otherwise.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "Yeah. It's, you know it's a conference that have they have talks about various aspects of language technology and sessions, and so on. So, questions and answers. Yeah. I mean, it's it's a reasonable way to to to test PROJECT2 technology.",
            "And I think it's - Yeah, it is good, because it's it's part of the language community and was also,, and I mean, it, yeah. There's a lot of kind of users of language technology turn up, see what's happening in the language technology world. So, yeah. PERSON5 has to work work to go in there, but - Yeah, it's just a - It's artificial because it's not multilingual conference.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Meta forum, meta events -",
            "It's online this year in December.",
            "Yeah. I'm I'm trying to - It's actually not listed in on meta net events web page.",
            "I think have got a few e-mails about it, but it in -",
            "Yeah, so do I. But it's -",
            "Yeah. See.",
            "Meta forum twenty twenty. It's still I am, I'm failing to find -",
            "No, I got meta forum registered now.",
            "But it's not on the on the web. I'm failing to find meta forum twenty twenty.",
            "See if I can - It's not chat. Let's put in the document.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I also have this register now, but I don't see - There is no - it's virtual event it's so virtual that ORGANIZATION9 doesn't find it.",
            "I've just got a horrible list link to that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No. Just I got - Yeah I got to it at least.",
            "Okay. So I actually found another link.",
            "I got the link now. Okay, that's the one.",
            "From Berlin. So we should probably try getting in touch with - We should try getting in touch with PERSON and do it as a test test event for us. Now without the, the the publicity around that. But only testing it, so that we can provide subtitles, and only have a like a limited number of of users.",
            "And next year if there is no ORGANIZATION12 Congress, we should try to get a full present there. That's artificial, yes, but it is a fall back solution. And it is a d a good test case for us, it is, that's for sure.",
            "So do you do you agree that we should try to run all the systems for December? It's just connecting to this life event and subtitling, but. We have done this similar to the Uni Hack for example. The Uni Hack was also something online.",
            "Yeah. We just said we will we will do it. And we, we got one positive response from someone who have found out the, the live stream, and and he was watching that. So.",
            "Yeah, I think is that I mean, it sounds like a good idea. I guess guess you are right. We should be aware about making it to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "To.",
            "Keep as a as - Depends how we feel it's gonna work, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Keep it as a test event. Do we also do any. There is no physical setup, is there? Because it's -",
            "There's nothing physical -",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. So - So we just have to look in to the stream.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah. PERSON17 suggests to use use meta, meta forum twenty twenty as a test event. Run our systems there without too much, publicity. If there is no Congress. So,, that's a that's,, like, the the first possible, fall back solution to get into meta forum twenty twenty one. But we'll ask PERSON36, for the ORGANIZATION2 thing and still, further options are, thought thought for. So if you have any other ideas, even local ones. Like the local ones are actually more, one, because they will be spoken in German, in Italian, whatever. Please, let us know.",
            "Local events here gonna speak English, I'm afraid.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Well -",
            "I don't know how it come.",
            "We are confident in catching the audio stream from an online event. And actually I am not, but PERSON17 you look pretty confident about it.",
            "We have done that.",
            "Okay. I'm happy to know it.",
            "But there are many, webinars running, online right now due to the Covid situation for example. The Pi campus one, of speaker.",
            "Which was on on language technologies we did. And and it was pretty nice, maybe to provide some kind of subtitle service on such events.",
            "So we were without translation only the just a transcription would be it or the translation is also an important thing?",
            "Well. In my opinion yes, because the event was in English.",
            "Many, viewers were Italian for example.",
            "Okay,.",
            "And well -",
            "Yes, so this is - This is exactly the type of events that we -",
            "That we want to gather. So please put it here in the document, and may be like as a past event but maybe there, there will be new instances of that.",
            "And I also would like to ask PERSON1, because, you are t going to all these various events and now mainly remotely. So what what types of events is that? Is that like education technologies or - You had also something like medical, didn't you?",
            "Yes, we also went to medical events, but more on technology based events and -",
            "Yeah, we can also share some events maybe with you.",
            "Yeah, so how multilingual these events are and how multilingual adn, like insufficiently proficient the audience is? Can you figure out, can you list some of the events where you are quite close to the organizers, so that you could get in touch with the organizers. And where the audience is as multilingual as possible and where the audience in one way, or another would benefit from from the translation. So please -",
            "Okay.",
            "Down sample your long list to do this and we'll try to figure out some some venues, which we'll we should really try to, to, to connect to.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. So, well - Yeah? Any other comments?",
            "Yeah, PERSON17, just wanted to in my country we also reach out to the start conferences. We just all - All of the conference are running virtual. Like or or some other conference.",
            "Conference, which are is there, and maybe maybe some yes, we can.",
            "Yes, we can. But I'm wondering whether, we are sufficiently - Like the audience is sufficiently profficient English. So I think, it's it's very similar to the meta forum and the content is more, technical so to say. So, whereas in meta forum it will be still high-level overview talks. And the high-level overview talks would be easier to translate than all the technical terms in in the standard,, SL conferences. So that's why I'm not thinking of, of them.",
            "Okay.",
            "But at the same time, you're well, you are from from different country. So maybe you can, even, mention some, well, Indian things, that could - Obviously we don't have ASR for that. But if if, there is some event, which is held in English, and attended by people from Asia as well, we could we could expand our language coverage somewhat. But not not much obviously. We have PERSON13 the there at the back end anyway already. So -",
            "So we have this conference which is coming up. It it is the largest conference in India.",
            "Yeah, I would not - Yes, I know I know, about Icon. But I I d I think it would be better to use other like non-technical conferences. Less technical conferences.",
            "Maybe. Yeah -",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you. Yeah, great.Eh, so - That's that was the the responses to the reviewers. Now, the Covid extension - We'll file it. Full stop. So PERSON18 please make sure that we will, that we are filing this request to get three extra months. If anybody still can contribute any ideas, here is the document. And we have heard from ORGANIZATION3. We haven't heard from ORGANIZATION11. If you have any sa - And we haven't heard from ORGANIZATION10 and we haven't have heard from ORGANIZATION8. So, ORGANIZATION11, ORGANIZATION8 and ORGANIZATION10.",
            "Oh, what you need from us?",
            "Some suggestions, because the the coordinator should address, at least some of the below points in order to justify the request for extension.",
            "Oh.",
            "And then they have number of of things like issues which have led to delays and yeah. So we are collecting the possible answers. Why do we want an extension. So, if you have any such suggestion, please put it into this document, and put it there today or tomorrow. It's like just brainstorming and we'll wrap it up. We'll wrap it up it up, and and file it. Again let's say by the end of the week. So that it is it is that this is done. Yeah, okay? So, I write it down. So,, ORGANIZATION11, ORGANIZATION11, ORGANIZATION10, ORGANIZATION8 please look and provide ideas or say none. They filing the request, at the end of the week. Yeah, okay. So we have spent an hour in the call. I don't want to go over the progress of the work packages in detail. Is there - But thanks to those who have provided the details into document. Please include your progress here in any case. So I still miss the ASR update. There is something on,, s from ORGANIZATION11 on SLT and so on. Is there anything in the in the progress of the work packages that should be discussed the global like in the full consortium? Would you like to draw attention to anything of this?",
            "On my side, just a minor theme. We saw during the the review meeting preparation the revision interface of PERSON27.",
            "And we would like to plan maybe a meeting with me and PERSON27 and ORGANIZATION10.",
            "Yes.",
            "To have a look at it.",
            "Please do.",
            "Okay, I will plan it. Okay.",
            "Yes, please, please plan it - Please, make sure that we take part in that as well. And, that I hope that the revision interface would be available from ORGANIZATION3 in in some form, but -",
            "Okay.",
            "It's probably PERSON19 who'll have to confirm this.",
            "But let's start having a meeting and having more detailed look at that.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, and then on dissemination I also see no update. So if ORGANIZATION8 could, input some updates on the if there are any. On dissemination activities.",
            "Okay.",
            "And that's it. So ev we have discussed ethics f in in, sufficient detail. And we'll we'll be working on the individual, things I mean in smaller groups as as always. So I think that's that's probably a good time sh to end the full call -",
            "Can I have a question?",
            "Yes.",
            "Just what is ORGANIZATION16 in work package on data?",
            "Oh this is the -",
            "Yeah, that is the data from the ORGANIZATION16 website.",
            "Okay. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. So there are texts?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah, okay. So if that is everything that we need to discuss globally then thank you very much for participation. Please,, do the things that are due today. The Covid extension ideas, and, have a look at your papers listed in the review. Sorry in the progress report,, and, it was ORGANIZATION3 and maybe some others who need to still respond to some of the requests from the reviewer. And otherwise we will put, you will send it, by the end of the week. Okay, so thank you very much I'll talk to you no later than in a month from now at one of the call together.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you. Bye bye.",

            "Hello, does it work?",
            "Hello.",
            "Yes, oh, ok, it actually works so I I don't understand this. So were able were already connected for the last few minutes or not?",
            "Yeah, I was connected.",
            "Yeah, ok. So it, because didn't seem like connected. Ok. So. Yes we we have we are still waiting for PERSON14. So one thing that I didn't finish writing in that comment in the ORGANIZATION7 doc is the question about from you about the cheating. Obviously I would not pretend that fo the the cheating with having the language model over fit for the particular talk. Obviously we would not be pretending that we don't have this in, but it would be a nice contrast to show one session which has that the speech available. As in a former language model and one session which does not have it. So that there is very often the situation where the speech actually prepared well head of time. And all the like the speeches sometimes even given by someone who has not written it. And in that case the it's fair to have that speech within the language model of the system. So it's good good to be able to compare. So how far are we PERSON9 from from using some language model over fitting for a talk?",
            "As far as I know for the for the hybrid ASR model it's possible to adapt the language model and. Now I'm I'm not super sure what we've done before in this topic is often to go through the transcript and add words which we which we don't language model as is and we can have those words in language model. I don't think that they do like re-training of language model to that specific the match the the same structure.",
            "To the engrams.",
            "Yeah, I I don't think that they usually do that but PERSON13 would know the details about that.",
            "Yeah, so please activate PERSON13 on this so that we could als. If I don't know what what is it's capacity. I don't know what is the the circumstances of your offices. Whether.",
            "That's that's not a problem. The problem right now is that apparently some sort of catastrophe has happened and then in the server room. A yesterday when the when the workers were saying to fix the power they were saying this would take between 5 and 6 hours. Today the power is not up and they're saying it will take all day today and tomorrow. So in in in a classic construction fashion they appear to have fix it worse. So PERSON10 is is in communication with them right now. I imagine quite angry.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I mean probably we should we should determine some sort of time at which we you know pull the parachute and say we have to postpone the meeting because we don't have any ASR workers.",
            "So we have so we can run our own, we can do Czech sure. Because that's so PERSON4 please confirm. We can do Czech for sure, and we have the English copy of ORGANIZATION6 model here. But we don't have segmentor, that's the problem.",
            "Yes.",
            "I I don't hear you, are you muted?",
            "So in worst case we can use PERSON11's ASR and my segmentor.",
            "But are we. Like postpone the demo or to give a demo with like worst case scenario workers and very restrictive set of languages.",
            "So I think the set of languages is ok. So we can from Czech ASR. And we have the segmentor for Czech which we have tested before. So that is reasonable. But we would not have the German input because we don't have any German ASR. And for the English with the with the segmentor of ours it's not as good as your is. So that's that's a clear drawback.",
            "PERSON7.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Good morning.",
            "Morning, morning, yeah, sorry.",
            "Do you think that it will be so so bad to ask for a re-schedule of the demo which since actually we will not be able to show all the power of we add in editor models of ASR and machine translation. And I think ready, the project officer I I really like the the Czech demo actually. But I think that we will not be able to fill one hour and half of demo just this kind of input.",
            "Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So that's.",
            "It's actually a definitely a good good thing to say. Well we do not have a control over power outage of servers and.",
            "We should have some like plan so to say. We should have a set which is resilient to that. So I see that as, like regardless whether we ask for postponing or not. I see this as again a very important like lesson. I'magine that this would have happened during the congress itself. And it is possible that this could happen during the congress. So we really need to be we need to have backup plan for one or two sides going of power.",
            "Ok.",
            "So I know that the there is when the corona virus was starting and when when they were not sure whether the whether to like how to handle the congress when they were still considering to run it. They already had and I think they always have a plan to have replacement building so so in case someone like some there is a like bomb alarm they still have chance to to put these 400 people elsewhere. So we have we need to have the same thing. So so about the deadline for the parachute plug or so on. Will PERSON10 let you know immediately after he learn something from the workers? Yeah, so like when. I think that we, if we want to postpone the demo, we definitely need to send the e-mail by today say 2 in the afternoon.",
            "Well, we can also tell PERSON15 if he prefer to see just the Czech or to have a -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's I think I think that would that would look better. Because that would document that we're not like using false excuse. It would say that we have one site problem and we can show limited demo. Because I imagine it could be firmly difficult to find a slot for all the participants. And also how much do we need to postpone that so by how much?",
            "Well actually it depends based on.",
            "I wish I could give you an estimate but it seems like the estimate from construction workers. Optimistic.",
            "I would say volatile but I will not want to use that word so postpone.",
            "Yes.",
            "So when when is the construction going to be over because.",
            "The construction it will be for another year.",
            "Oh, ok.",
            "Yeah, but the power outage.",
            "Yeah, yeah because like we are experiencing also network failures. Like 2 days ago serious one. And that's because there has been a building completed for our department our school of informatics. And they are now changing the network so that the other building is also like connected, fully connected with with the machines there. But often they misconfigure things and we loose our connectivity like fully. So that that has happened in the last 2 days as well. And they they keep touching thing these days. So, but that's there is equal risk as I see it for tomorrow as for 2 weeks from now so I don't see any difference in that. There could be.",
            "There is a risk, there is a risk 2 weeks from now but there is a definitive power outage right now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As far as having some sort of back up location we cannot duplicate our server infrastructure elsewhere. It was very difficult even to get a second server room that we can expand. It is not possible within ORGANIZATION6 to get another server room and to have some some sort of. We could.",
            "I mean I don't know I can discuss with our server admin maybe we can move some like some of the essential servers to the to the other side. So at least we have some basic servers running but I mean that just moves the critical infrastructure to a different failure point. You know the power.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Building.",
            "And that involves like moving a server is half a day. So.",
            "Yes and and the real problem with that is we we don't have physical access to the server room - we want. In the other building, in a old server room it can go whenever we want. The other building is very strict about that, only the IT admins from that building are allowed to open the server room, they have to be there all the time as we have to actually schedule whenever we need to go in and press the button.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So, and I'm not sure that that will increase the reliability of our system.",
            "So I think that we need to replicate your your workers elsewhere. I think that PERSON13 has already prepared a docr machine for segmentor, hasn't he? Did that happen? Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so I did have for the segmentor and we have a start alone machine here dedicated only for segmentor because our machine did not support docr. But I spent week and I spent almost like more than a week in starting the segmentor and its dependencies but I I never successful.",
            "Really? What what did we send you for the segmentor? Do we just send you like a zip because that doesn't need any dependencies.",
            "Yeah you sent a zip doc. So it failed during installation, there were some issues with.",
            "Oh I remember going back yeah I I seem to remember that conversation and you were trying to build.",
            "Well, if it's if it's just a matter of servers, of course ORGANIZATION4 can make vailable some web server. But it's not something we can start in half a day actually.",
            "Yeah, I was hoping that this this should be able to, so so PERSON4. I'll probably go outside because we have 2 microphones here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So we have 2 microphones in the same room and that's not good idea. So I think that it should be easy enough to deploy a docr on server. So I think it's really should be doable within a few hours so half a day. But so what what there be an option that the zip image that PERSON4 has from PERSON13 would be simply forwarded to ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION4 would get this segmentation worker running. Because that would solve it. We would not have the German ASR but we would have the English good segmentor and we would have the Czech.",
            "I can make running our server, pretty fast I can grant you also our SSH access to it. If you give me your public IP. So that we can restrict SSH just from your IP. And but it will be a completely new server so you need to install docr and all the other things by yourself.",
            "So PERSON9.",
            "And then make it running and configure it properly I think it's not that fast. But if if you ask it I will start it.",
            "So PERSON9, what do you think?",
            "So I checked, because right now I couldn't send you a docr image even if I wanted to. Because.",
            "You don't have it.",
            "Servers are physically off but the docr image which I sent to PERSON4 was uploaded to ORGANIZATION7 drive so. That link.",
            "Ok. If you would like to make this kind of test at least I'm just going to ask permission in order to run a new control machine.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Meanwhile, please, test with PERSON4 the Czechs demo, please please please please.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So my question was now on PERSON8 whether there is any update for the autoplay or not? If there is any chance to have it. But obviously the autoplay is nice to have feature.",
            "Yes, ok, so. The autoplay is definitely it's impossible we cannot the web up in conti based on on the simple player which depends on your browser. What we cannot with is I have, ok PERSON4 already has a copy of a script I posted. The idea is this. Instead of playing the video exactly is on Youtube ok we we already add to process it in order to to make it faster to the stream, ok? And additional step is to prepare to the video a 5 seconds of a clip, it's a clip. It right now is 5 seconds it is it's a parameter so we can change it. It's it shows the literal logo for 5 seconds. During those 5 seconds people connecting to the demo will have to refresh and refresh the page on the publication platform and then click play. They have 5 seconds they all should manage once they click they are all sort of with the everything else. The playlist is already playing on the on PERSON4 side so the streaming is already ongoing and the the transcript is also going and all pipeline is going.",
            "Yeah, ok. So I think it's good idea so the the solution is that there would be an image shown and I think that if this image if the first frame of the video contains also like instructions that remember to click play and then remember to.",
            "Going to be shown on the subtitles.",
            "Yeah, but the image, the image could also include arrows like where you should click.",
            "Please.",
            "Ok, it took a whole day just to have the logo.",
            "Oh. Whole day. Ok.",
            "I mean, I do not I must rest I do not know anything about FM peg about video editing and stuff.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Ok, so I'll have a look what what is available. I though it's easy.",
            "Ok, the scripting relies on a single static image if I can edit that image.",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly. This is what I meant, this is what I meant a single static image which has these arrows.",
            "Arrows spotting down I guess.",
            "Yeah, yeah. No animation because remember the image will be shown static. Until people click play. So it has to be static. The information -",
            "Yeah,. Ok, this is somewhat doable.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, I can work on a. Despite all of this once we have the image the whole proce there are 2 steps of the recording so the actually it takes let's say 50 minutes to run video so for the demo itself.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So and this this is time PERSON4's servers has to run it because there is no way for us to share the video and code it right so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Guys.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Have to download the video again and run this processing.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Which, guys sorry. Which kind of operating system do you prefer on machine? PERSON4 is fine for you? Santo 7.",
            "I mean probably we have the problems if the docr contains running the same system as the as the host. Which is 18 0 4 I think. If that's possible.",
            "So PERSON4 can you confirm that the machine where we tested the image his was Ubuntu 18 0 4? Can you log in there just to check?",
            "Yeah, yeah, I can log in definitely.",
            "Also our our machine is machine and the docr image I don't know how well docr works when you're running a different.",
            "She not be a problem but for me is the same.",
            "It is open to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "L LTS.",
            "18 0 4 8.",
            "Ok. I'm going to prepare the virtual machine. Just please send me your public IPs in order to grant you SSH access to the virtual machine ok.",
            "Can I send you a public key?",
            "I think yes. Yep.",
            "I would prefer that.",
            "Oh no no, because actually there is a kind of firewall in front of this kind of virtual machine. We have to. I I have to check, I check it.",
            "I don't have a static IP.",
            "Yeah, I understand exactly. Ok. Let me let me check it. Meanwhile please test the fall back solution just just the Czechs one.",
            "Yeah yeah, so. PERSON4 please let us know whenever we should.",
            "So obviously we we can test English and German right now because we don't have segmentors for English.",
            "No no, but Czech Czech input.",
            "Yeah so for Czech I'm connect with PERSON3 and he's helping me with fixing with MT wrapper.",
            "So so let us know whenever this.",
            "Yeah sure sure I'm just connect to him.",
            "So in the meantime there we still need to prepare the slides so I'll I'll be doing that. If you have any. The link to the slides is already in the document. And if you have any work plans like future plans to be mentioned in this demo at the end of the demo session, please put them there to the slides. So create, feel free to create new slides there. This would be particularly I would expect ORGANIZATION6 to mention something, for example the ASR end to end systems. And also ORGANIZATION3 if they have any end to end SLT experiments or plans.",
            "We should probably ask PERSON2 to take a look.",
            "Yeah. There is so far nothing in this slides and if you add something then make sure that you know how to comment it during the live session. So I I can try commenting myself but there should be someone to step in in case like more details are needed. But this would be very vague these these people would be some of them would be probably technical people but some of them would be simple like potential users of of our systems I guess.",
            "Yeah so the question is even how how useful is talking about end to end ASR mean to the users.",
            "Well it I think it is useful to if we can illustrate it then it is useful. So the what are the main benefits of end to end ASR.",
            "Right now works better.",
            "Does it work better in in the word error rate but it's that's still offline set up and not online. And it's not well connected with the segmentation. So I think this is this is easy enough message to to present. Because people understand that the offline and online use can be different and if we have a system which is better in offline mode it is very good idea to try to to also adapt it for the online use when we want it. So. Yeah. So PERSON14 I'm sending you the 3, and also PERSON9 in in copy, the 3 machines that I came up with with static addresses from which will be mostly connecting.",
            "Ok.",
            "But if you actually could allow the whole sub network then I think that would be safe, so.",
            "I I probably will rent SSH well I have to reason about it. But don't worry.",
            "So it's - So the first 3 numbers in the IP addresses are all the same so allowing all of them would would be safer. So PERSON4 what are we waiting now for? What is what is the current problem?",
            "Current problem is MT wrapper.",
            "So what has happened with MT wrapper?",
            "I don't know so. It's pretty messed up right now. And PERSON3 is helping. There is just like just one little bug which is ruining the complete pipeline. When the Czech is getting translated, into English. Because English is the pivot language.",
            "And how come that we didn't have this problem before?",
            "Because we were using MT cash.",
            "Ok.",
            "And it was like super. MT, MT wrapper is quite, it's complicated but it's very sophisticated. So in all to effort it it need some time.",
            "And can you go to the in the meantime, do you still have the older set up so that you would launch it with the older set up?",
            "Older set up.",
            "So this I suggest that you have like various versions of the script. And the older set up would be using the MT cash not MT wrapper. Which doesn't suffer from this broken pipe problem.",
            "And if. Is like I'm really regularly the script, so it's difficult to.",
            "No, but whenever you have something that works, give it a name and don't update it and don't touch it. From that point on words. We need to have a version to to rivet to.",
            "Yes, I agree.",
            "So PERSON9, are you in the meantime, you have located the the ORGANIZATION7 drive link, right? So whenever you get access to that to the machine, you can get you can try to get the segments running, right? And we're waiting for PERSON10 to let us know whether the power will be on during today. So PERSON13, how is your model, so can you, in the meantime tell me some details about the models that you have been training and you said that something new will emerge today or.",
            "Ok, so I've been training models for each of the 7 source languages the ASR source languages. The translate into as many of the ORGANIZATION8 and ORGANIZATION2 languages as I can get data full. So that's pretty much all of the languages apart from like 2 or 3. When there's no data in.",
            "And it's a single model for all the 7 inputs and 43 targets, right?",
            "7 models, each have a single source language.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "And translate into roughly 40 target languages.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "So the trained on from. So in the models I used in first year there was a cap for million sentence pairs per language remember. So I removed I removed that cap but because obviously there is a lot small data for some language pairs and others. I've used smoothed distribution sound put with them for the smooth distribution. And the same with sub. So for some language pairs it's over like open subtitles data. For example so we try to balance. The English version is fine tune on of the sentence pairs. Kind of similar to what ORGANIZATION6 do but it's a simple when we don't use. But I don't need on that for the English version of that.",
            "Yeah, and these are now deployed as workers.",
            "So the English and German are deployed as workers on setting setting the Czech one up right now.",
            "Ok, yep.",
            "So hopefully within the next maybe half an hour will be live.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The others I could set up.",
            "I don't think that's necessary.",
            "Ok.",
            "And the older ones are still available as workers, right? So PERSON4 can choose.",
            "Well actually they're they're configured and they're like ready to deploy but they're not running. We kinda sure on GPUs at the moment, so if if we would it would be nice to have them running as back up I guess. But I may have to ask some people to experiments.",
            "Yeah. So yeah. So the thing is that we have not really evaluated this models and I find it a bit risky. To to just test them live.",
            "Right, right. So yeah the the English one is the model what was used in the edible SLT submission. So I mean we've test it yet. In that setting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah the other hopefully the the other models perform as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But there not tested.",
            "There is there is there is a big risk that well someone will just mess up the fingerprints. And if we're still so much fidling with the set up it can happen that we'll be translating from the wrong language. Or so. So yep. Problem is that at the moment really cannot cannot do anything because we're waiting for the segmentor.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So PERSON13 you have sent the translations of using there was using the older models, right?",
            "No, this is using the Ni models.",
            "Ok. But you still mention that something, ooh ok. Yeah. So maybe, no you cannot deploy these even for the translation because you don't have any GPUs at the moment right? So you cannot translate the files with the older model just for comparison.",
            "Hang on, let me let me take a look.",
            "Because PERSON6 is now or will be running blascores over these and comparing also to PERSON1.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "But again this this blascores would be full segment based and not the partial segments and the impression can be different again so.",
            "Ok. So actually we do have couple of GPUs free so.",
            "Yeah, take them.",
            "So I couldn't run everything at the same time but I can run your test sets through them one by one. And send you the outputs.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I mean I mean deployed as run it as a worker, right? The older model as well.",
            "Yes.",
            "But the critical question is whether the fingerprint differs, so that there is no confusion which model is being used.",
            "Yes. Yeah, the fingerprint is different.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so we have we have at most MT workers running at the same time in the past. So yeah we've come up with fingerprints. So they the each have unique fingerprints.",
            "Yeah. So I see PERSON14 is sending the.",
            "Yes, the machine is up and running at the moment SSH access is allowed to everyone. With the password. I will change this of course. But meanwhile please check if the it's what you've expected. It's the correct operating system or not. In order to become root sudo minus I and the same password, ok? It's it's good virtual machine and I will switch it off after demo ok? Otherwise PERSON5 will kill me.",
            "Yeah. Thank you.",
            "No worry. I hope this this will help us in order to accomplish access for demo. Ok. Tell me if it's the correct operating system. It's it's ubunto ubuntu 18 0 4 LTS.",
            "Yeah, yeah that's it.",
            "I haven't found configuration for also dot 4, but I think that is just a minor.",
            "Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.",
            "Ok. Another recommendation. This virtual machine has been deployed in the let's say PROJECT2 production infrastructure we have is the the one where we run also mediator and presentation platform. This means that actually you can reach also the other machines. Please don't. Please don't, access just this machine. I I tell it because you will you will be you will have the power to become root. And this could be.",
            "A disaster.",
            "Yep.",
            "So I've manage successfully to log in and but, well I don't have the the files and I have never really work with docr, so PERSON9 can you step in? Does it work for you?",
            "Sorry, I'm I'm getting the call from PERSON10.",
            "Ok, yep.",
            "So PERSON7, coming to the question of testing these models. So actually German model was running during the last test we did with PERSON12 into Romanian.",
            "Ok.",
            "First test she did was using the old model, the second using the new model.",
            "Ok, I see that.",
            "She thought the new.",
            "The new one was better, yes. Yeah, yeah. That's good.",
            "And there was a lot less.",
            "But that was the, that was the ASR segmentation workers which are not accessible at the moment at all.",
            "Right, right. So yeah I guess it was tested on the ideal conditions.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, so I have the pipeline done. PERSON3 fixed there were there were 2 little box and MT wrapper. And there. And we can see it running now.",
            "Ok, so should we go to the PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION4 platform view?",
            "So I'll be back in a second.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can also resize maybe presentation platform. How far we are from starting the the test of the demo?",
            "It's PERSON3 we're done. And just a thing.",
            "Ok, ok ok. I wait.",
            "I also implemented I frames so to see ORGANIZATION4 and in the same. Like a compact window.",
            "Paste the link to the ORGANIZATION7 document.",
            "In the in the same repository.",
            "But so that people know worker watches.",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "Allright.",
            "Yep.",
            "So it's it's it's really it's the classical comedy of error going on at that construction site. They they power line on Tuesday. Plan to then completely dig it up and you know view the view the damage yesterday and the and they didn't have another one so this morning they're getting a new digger to dig up the power language. They have done nothing yet. Like literally nothing. And supposedly the electrician will get back to PERSON10 at 1. And then we then we will know whether they can fix the damage today or not. No, I don't know how much I place in that whether he will be at lunch break at 1 or whether he will actually calls PERSON10 at 1. It's it's over there.",
            "Does couple of these.",
            "I I I suggested that to PERSON10 he he disagrees.",
            "Ok. Guys, do I have time to make also presentation platform virtual machine resize or not?",
            "Yeah so there's I firm estimate file which I post which I have pushed in the.",
            "Please, paste web page link on in the Github repository so that we can see the file as as well. So that we know where it is in is somewhere in cruise control.",
            "Ok.",
            "Thanks for the the news, well. So I'll have to leave before like I have less than an hour now. And I'll have to go home and then like be with the kids in in yeah, whatever it's compli.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So between 1 and 2 we will synchronize by e-mail. And at 2 we will send the e-mail to the project officer ted we have we give them the option to have the full demo in what do we say week? Exact same time? Or more? I think week should be enough but.",
            "I I should hope that week will be enough.",
            "Yeah, so. So ok, so this is the plan for the few hours now, until we learn from the electrician. And PERSON9 please now try to getting the segmentor running on that virtual machine that PERSON14 provided. Because that.",
            "Yeah, I'm working on that now.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok.",
            "Thank you PERSON9.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So I'm updating the ORGANIZATION7 document on on how you can set up the thing. So.",
            "So you have to download this extension, ok.",
            "Yeah, so this extension basically enables iphone policy.",
            "Yep.",
            "This one. Well it's not bad. Probably I don't need to resize presentation platform virtual machine. Just have to check what we run during workshop. Just to be sure. But actually it's a good.",
            "So I need to start a few more instancies of the PROJECT1 worker and start test.",
            "PERSON9, if you have some problem reaching mediator and so on, I have seen to open probably some ports on the file wall. So please tell me if you get stuck somewhere, ok?",
            "Ok.",
            "Guys, we have it running now so let's start.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, so you have to download that file the easier set up is to just go to this page. But you probably need the extension so.",
            "Me?",
            "Yeah, everybody. Like who wants to see both subtitles and paragraphes. Then yeah. Then they can use this link which I'm just highlighting in the ORGANIZATION7 document.",
            "Ok.",
            "I can share my screen if you guys want. Because I have a ORGANIZATION9 client and it won't share the complete window, extended window. It will be like.",
            "I think it's ok, yeah.",
            "Yes, ok.",
            "Look really strange on my side but maybe it's just a matter of browser.",
            "Well.",
            "And.",
            "It doesn't look strange.",
            "PERSON8? PERSON8 is here?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, yes, thank you. In order to get the 5 seconds of pre-video do I need to like do anything?",
            "Yes, so at this time you can you can ru. I merge my my latest updates.",
            "Yeah, I already pull it.",
            "Ok, if you run the one shot one shot preprocess script. Ok? You give it one the input name and the output name. And that does the the pre-processing and it depends of 5 seconds of the logo before that.",
            "Ok, so I need to run the pre-process again with with the same same and it will automatically take the logo.",
            "Yes, the logo is it's the same folder.",
            "Ok, ok. I get it.",
            "The script expects the original MP4 video from Youtube.",
            "Yes, yes, I understand. So yeah, let me done it so that we just to run it so I can heard.",
            "Sorry PERSON7?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Do I need to do anything in order to correctly see the iframe solution? Because actually I'm able to see at least a part of the presentation platform in the bottom of the of the iframe, but the upper part it isn't displayed.",
            "So can you share the screen so that we see what you're seeing.",
            "I think it's because of the iframe policy of, maybe she is opening on ORGANIZATION7 Chrome and ORGANIZATION7 Chrome.",
            "Ok, which browser works?",
            "Firefox.",
            "Firefox.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON8 in which directory is the preprocessing script?",
            "It's the same set up set ups FFM peg with the longest name possible.",
            "Yeah, but I don't see that preprocessing script.",
            "Ok, let me check.",
            "Maybe I have let me check.",
            "Ok, I push the master at 10 something I think so.",
            "So by the way, I've opened a private window with this URL to to see both this subtitles and paragraphs. And the video started on auto in autoplay for me. So it's browser dependent it really some browsers play it upfront and some don't. I don't get it.",
            "So it's not one check process instead of preprocess I think.",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok, ok. Yes it's working and I'll get the video ready.",
            "Yes, it's going to incode the thing twice so it's going to take a while.",
            "Yeah, no problem.",
            "Yeah, also the version you're running will just have the logo on on a white background. I'm I paint the image will be instructions but I I'm still testing that it works.",
            "Ok, ok. And PERSON7 in this set up would you like to have the opening instructions.",
            "I didn't get the question, sorry?",
            "So with this set up, would you like to have the opening instructions, the basically.",
            "Yes, I think that I think that, I think every every video should have this instructions. They, maybe not 5 but, well 5 is ok. I think all the video should have this 5 seconds delay at the beginning.",
            "And the thing is that PERSON8 again after 5 second you will have to reload the page.",
            "Yes, so, I thought about that, ok. The point is the the 5 seconds of logo are not meant they only work after the refresh. So only once the playlist is active. That means FFM peg is already streaming.",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly. And that happens only after.",
            "Only after the refresh.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm also preparing now a different, a completely separate video which can be streamed before, it is going to loop and that video is going to show the instructions. It's going to say once the countdown reaches the 0, refresh the page.",
            "It behaves differently for me, so I don't.",
            "I have no.",
            "I don't see the problem that you are.",
            "Oh, ok. The issue is this. PERSON7, I think you're lost, I lost you.",
            "Wait a second PERSON8, because we lost PERSON7.",
            "Yes. We also lost PERSON4? I don't know.",
            "PERSON9 is still there?",
            "Yeah, I'm here.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, let me repeat the let me state this idea just so, yeah, sure. Ok, the the current proposal is this. When we are not showing anything, we must also be showing something. Otherwise people won't won't have a let say ok. The set up is always have a playlist available. When we are not streaming something. So when the demo is let say not active, the playlist we show is going to have a loop showing only the static image of the logo and instruction which are saying \"Watch, watch the stream and when you see the countdown below reaching zero, refresh\". When you refresh.",
            "A good idea I don't know if actually we are going to have the countdown. We have the countdown?",
            "Well, I though we have a countdown. Ok. The point is.",
            "Please please check it carefully with PERSON4.",
            "I cannot check anything with PERSON4 because, check it from here.",
            "So guess guess what happened. The whole ORGANIZATION1 network was like stop working. So this this is the network disruption that I.",
            "PERSON7, do you have, PERSON7 do you have a backup as speaker for tomorrow?",
            "We do PERSON4 has a big data plan, so. He has already working he has been starting that from his cellphone. Yeah. But the problem is that if the servers are affective by this, then we do not have a second.",
            "So what you're telling you do not have a second server room of side.",
            "We have 2 server rooms at different sites in LOCATION1, but we don't have the entry points to them. Like I don't know how to log in to them. So I think they the machines in the server rooms are not affected by this network error. But they could, you know there there is the network administrators are now like running with diggers everywhere. Only only technically not physically but it's, yes, they're re-configuring the network. So they, yeah. They can dig into any wire at any moment.",
            "Of course the ORGANIZATION4 virtual machine can host all of you guys. I have just to check disc size.",
            "PROJECT2 is now sponzored by ORGANIZATION5 AWS.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "No, no no, we are on asian unfortunately.",
            "This is crazy.",
            "At least we are really doing our best in order to test.",
            "Yeah. Ok so PERSON4 if you are connected. You're now muted probably so.",
            "PERSON8 was explaining.",
            "Yeah, I'm connected.",
            "Before a network problem. PERSON8. Would you like to repeat it? PERSON8.",
            "Yes. So, ok. I can only explain what I can manage to do. Not something else. So. The idea is, ok. The the problem I see still is that. People are going to connect to presentation platform. They are going to see whatever playlist we have left on the on the web folder. The plan is now this. Before we run, ok, when PERSON4 is not actually streaming. A video which is going to be subtitle and everything he is going to stream a different video, that video is going to be static. Is going to be of course is going to be a dynamic playlist but it's going to show something static. That is going to be the the logo and visual instruction saying to the peopl to people \"watch the the countdown in a subtitles\". Are we still going to add the countdown? Ok. So.",
            "No no no no. Are we still going to have the countdown? PERSON7, PERSON4, do we will this countdown instructions?",
            "We don't need it anymore. Because we, yeah, we we tested it on Tuesday night when we were running the 10 machines or 20 machines in in the lab. And they're whenever we connected a new machine, all we did was to open web page on the PROJECT2 platform, click play and click like live, which is clicking the very last bit of the of the slider of the video. And that joined the live streaming. The subtitles were always in sync and the the video was also very close to to in sync. So we do not need the countdown anymore.",
            "Ok.",
            "So the instructions has to be fixed or we need to put the countdown in order to tell people when to refresh their pages.",
            "So they the question is when the refresh is needed. In our experience the refresh is needed when we change the video.",
            "Yes.",
            "Exactly.",
            "When the FFM peg is stopped and started again.",
            "Exactly, so the first video, the one who shows the logo and just instructions is the first one. The second one is the one which actually plays the video demo. So we're going to stop one FFM peg in order to start the second one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And here probably refresh is required. And PERSON8 prepare the first video with the.",
            "I'm working on it. Does not exist yet.",
            "Is going to prepare the first video in order to show the PROJECT2 logo and instruction telling people to refresh their pages when.",
            "When we tell them. When we tell them.",
            "So PERSON8, could you look at this error which I got from the one shot process. I think it's the FFM peg version again maybe.",
            "There is a file.",
            "This is about frame rate. Videos are supposed to have a, you see the 48000 that is the audio frame rate.",
            "Ok.",
            "Can you show me the the input video you are using? The name.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok, so the name is is this NK use cz mp4.",
            "I only manage to test videos with 44 and 100.",
            "Ok, which.",
            "We can we can test this logo after we let's just hold it for a moment. And let's test our original set up and once.",
            "Ok, but may I ask you just a second to make FF probe of this video? Write you the -. Ok perfect. This is correct, it's the same as usual PERSON8.",
            "It's not the us the same as mine other anyway the script should be creating the logo with the proper the proper audio frequency and it's not working and I don't know why.",
            "It say that it cannot find the.",
            "Find the file, yes.",
            "Some some wrong path somewhere.",
            "Yeah, not a problem so let's hold this for some time and let's get back to original set up. And you guys can switch back to your screen. Where you see the where you see the 2 presenter window in iframe. And.",
            "Ok, the script is, do you have the the PNG logo locally at. Everything I'm making is supposed to be run from the same folder of course. Not meant to.",
            "Aha, ok.",
            "You need logo dot png logo dot png to make this work.",
            "Yeah I have the white logo png and logo png in same folder but the video is.",
            "Yeah, but where you running the the call from this folder.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I the video so in the current folder.",
            "Just a side note, everybody should avoid any remove commands in their shell scripts.",
            "Yes,",
            "Disrupt.",
            "Oh. Just comment this out it's or.",
            "Temporary files and they are but yeah you can comment your line.",
            "They will just remain there. Yeah.",
            "Ok. Find, ok, this. You're going to get a lot of temporary videos concused inside this so.",
            "Yes.",
            "Watch your. PERSON4 can you scroll up I saw I think I saw an error.",
            "Yes.",
            "I guess I somehow the yeah the the logo it's failing to generate the the movie of the logo from the image.",
            "I think it's the FFM peg version. If it's working for.",
            "PERSON8.",
            "Yeah.",
            "May I ask you to prepare the video for PERSON4 and upload it?",
            "Yes, where?",
            "Just upload it in ORGANIZATION7 drive. ORGANIZATION7 drive.",
            "I already have a copy here but.",
            "ORGANIZATION7 drive just do it in ORGANIZATION7 drive and and I have a very short command which should download it.",
            "Ok. Virtual machine could be also used to as CP files and.",
            "Ok.",
            "I know I don't know nothing regarding your internet connection so PERSON8 is it possible?",
            "I can only a.",
            "Hold this and run the remaining the old set up. So. Shall shall I start it?",
            "Yes please do so, what should we do?",
            "You just have to so.",
            "Reload.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely reload.",
            "It is playing.",
            "But I haven't started the system. Just do when they ask it, ok? So I'm starting in 5 4 3 2 1. Yeah yeah.",
            "So I'm going to interrupt you because I've been watching it and I my video has already stop playing and I still see the subtitles coming so my video was 10 seconds at least ahead of the subtitles.",
            "So the sub video also stopped in my system and there are still subtitles. Basically so these are the very last sentence which I still render rendering.",
            "But how is that possible that the ASR is so delayed. The ASR still getting some input that doesn't make any sense.",
            "Ok, wait a minute.",
            "So in the.",
            "Ok it's taking from, no, that is. Something is wrong.",
            "So in the meantime PERSON13 I've seen that in, there is oh, so there is just belgian or whatever language tag as the beginning of Romanian outputs right? If you look at the Romanian outputs there is always this BBB.",
            "Oh, ok, I didn't actually look at the outputs.",
            "I did so.",
            "Ok, so this is some from my side I think.",
            "But how was that playing happening, how come that it was so that I saw the video so much earlier than the subtitles.",
            "Yeah, that's.",
            "Well, sorry guys.",
            "Yeah.",
            "First, please consider that could also be the case that the ASR server is still just processing things and maybe it's not that a powerful machine and just a little bit slow. Moreover consider that we are all streaming everything internet lag. But I would like to the noise problem. Have you seen that from the Czech ASR the label noise underscore. Is outputted. And it's gonna be translated and making a mess in the translations.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, it does, yeah. You're right. Ok, I'll make this. So PERSON7, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So can you take your sub the ORGANIZATION1 presenter and see if the very last subtitles are very are related to the video or they're like some rubbish.",
            "There was, so I see sometimes forgotten sentences or sentence parts. Which is strange. So as if there was some sound input missing during some like portions of that stream. But when this is not the problem then the quality is good. So I don't know whether I don't know how to check but we should be listening, ideally listening to the sound which is going to the ASR. I think that in your new set up when you are probably directly sending from FFM peg to the EB client. It's seems like that there could be lex or skipped parts of audio and there could be also this edit delay happen.",
            "Yes, yes, you're right.",
            "Ok, but except from these I really liked the the demo. I checked both in the just presentation platform and also I really liked the splits screen in the -",
            "I think the split screen is good for us but it is bad for the. So and we also have the problem of jumping subtitles so it's again the segmentor is not perfect here. So the the split screen is complicated. I have a smaller laptop screen laptop here and it's quite impossible to fit it so that I see it well.",
            "Ok.",
            "I don't think that audience will manage. I think the audience needs to show only needs to see only the PROJECT2 platform subtitles.",
            "Ok. But I enjoyed also the split screen it was really interesting and I check just the English translation and except from the noise problem the translation was good. I understood the at least the phrases. Something that really works it's really nice.",
            "So PERSON7 I'm starting it just again I made a little change in on how.",
            "Ok.",
            "Output of FFM peg is fed to the EB client.",
            "So I'm going to open the PROJECT2 platform only as if I was the participant. I see the last video bit there.",
            "Yes.",
            "And that's only the last segment. So it should ideally be the the loop looping video that PERSON8 was talking about. I'm going to enable Czech and English, yes. And German. And I'm going to, well, but when I refresh, so you tell us when we should refresh, right?",
            "Yes. So you should refresh in.",
            "We can refresh later, that I don't think that's a problem of.",
            "Ok.",
            "Or actually I can refresh whenever I see this subtitles appearing.",
            "Let me run it a once, let me see if.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Things really works.",
            "So should, is it ready? Is the video playing?",
            "It should play.",
            "No.",
            "It's not.",
            "When after FFM peg stop streaming the playlist stays there. So what you are saying now is the last.",
            "Last bit, yes.",
            "Of the previous playing.",
            "Yeah exactly.",
            "Ok, I'm meanwhile I ok, I'm making videos in 48000 audio for PERSON4. I'm uploading them to the machine I let you know when I'm finished.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Thank you PERSON8, but may I ask you to move it from TMP. Leave it in the PVAD mean because you know that it needs to restart.",
            "Just restart the loose the TMPS.",
            "Just just as backup. At least we have a copy of all the files somewhere.",
            "So PERSON4, let us know when we should.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure. So it's strange.",
            "Meanwhile, PERSON9, I'm going to open a set of ports in the firewall for the virtual machine. So if you have some network problem probably it's me that I'm updating, ok?",
            "Yes. I'm just gathering the files right now anyway.",
            "The videos are uploaded, they are in the home of PD admin. They are called please wait and refresh on countdown so they are, they are called as they say.",
            "So PERSON7.",
            "Yep.",
            "Help here.",
            "Should I come over?",
            "Yeah, probably, that would be better.",
            "Yep, yep.",
            "So here...",
            "Ok, so I started the docr and compile and built it from sources. And I'm gonna be.",
            "So just to let you know we're not there just yet because PERSON4 can now play like stream the video. But we are not good at sending it at the same time to the PROJECT2 platform. We need to figure out how to add the output from FFM peg. PERSON4 could you mute yourself while yeah, yeah. So I need to be in the same room as PERSON4 so that I can diagnose but I'll I'll have to leave very shortly. And.",
            "So maybe first we have to schedule the next test session this afternoon.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So schedule something I'll I'll be busy and my machine will be busy with my kids and their like school duties. So I'll be at home with with the kids and they will be using my machine from during some time, not all the time. So schedule anything. You need to unmute yourself.",
            "And about this, ok. Ok and about the segmentor if because I have most of the thing set up, already set up. It's just some like installation issue. So I think if PERSON9 can assist me like one to one help, this can be diagnose quickly. Is PERSON9 here?",
            "I think he needs for a moments.",
            "Ok, ok, ok.",
            "And. Is it fine for you to be back at 15?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's completely fine.",
            "Ok, we will use always this ORGANIZATION9 call.",
            "This one will be busy. Like please provide another ORGANIZATION9 link because this is going, yeah.",
            "In any case I can provide the usual 40 minutes. PERSON9 is on we will link in the document.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And.",
            "Some point.",
            "I'll be busy until prob like sometime after 15 probably so well join without me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For sure. And also it'll be good to learn from PERSON9 if he's succeeding with the substitute server.",
            "Exactly.",
            "And I have a question on PERSON8. The FFM peg.",
            "PERSON8 is not here. Right now.",
            "No I'm here right now.",
            "Ok.",
            "Sorry PERSON8, scuza.",
            "So the question is, the FFM peg command that you crea that you use to create the times the short snippets of the of the video.",
            "Yes.",
            "It outputs something to STD out, some data. Do you know what it is? Because.",
            "No I don't keep the locks.",
            "It's not the locks, it's some data it's binary format. It's, I'm not talking about some error, I'm talking about the standard output of that command. And I have no experience with FFM peg you have now much better experience that I have. So. What is the output of FFM peg, how can we find out what the data is. Can we somehow find out what is the output of FFM peg?",
            "Well, the one in input to EB client it's raw file, so actually.",
            "Ok, now ok, now I understand the question, sorry.",
            "If you write the output of FFM peg into a file actually it will be a valid PCM file.",
            "Yes.",
            "This is this is what we assumed. This is what we oh I see that, the PCM as 16 LE there is.",
            "Yes, that is raw audio.",
            "But that has caused the delay. That's the problem. So it has caused the horrible delay in the in the set up. So this is what PERSON4 did in the morning test. Like when it work in the morning. So I'm trying to figure out how come that there was this huge delay. EB client was receiving the the sound. We saw the correct subtitles. But the delay was in seconds, like 10 seconds easily.",
            "Well the, the audio features are the only one which the presen the ORGANIZATION4 architecture is able to process. So maybe you would like to resample the video.",
            "What's resampling? No, we need, we need to avoid buffering from FFM peg. So FFM peg has some output buffer and it doesn't emit the sound quickly enough.",
            "Well, when.",
            "Well that that piece is already on copy so there there is no way to make it faster. And.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Re-encoding.",
            "Re-encoding. The re-encoding is.",
            "The re-encoding is already taking care in the pre-process script.",
            "Well, I I think there is a problem with FFM peg or some buffering of of standard output. So maybe Linux buffering on the pipe is is stepping in. So PERSON4 can can you try using this unbuffered we have this unbuffered prefix. Please put this in front of the FFM peg as well. So let's try that. That's. Like it is, that our machines are too slow for this video?",
            "Well, in principle it could be I mean the. If the video, you are you are passing through you're calling that Linux set up, right? Is that it.",
            "Well PERSON4 listen to that and I'll mute myself and PERSON4 will now talk.",
            "Oh ok. Just to make sure, PERSON4 you're running the Linux set up right?",
            "Yeah, I run it the set up, yeah.",
            "Ok, ok. The this path, this script expects a pre-processed video input.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "The encoding so it is already been done. It is assume that it is already done and this call just copies the input to the output. There is no re-encoding. So it cannot be possibly faster than this.",
            "So what I what just saying that could it be the.",
            "The EB client could also delay it itself, I think. Because is goin. Well, is going to establish the connection and and everything. That is going to take some time but there is no way to to make it shorter. You cannot prebuffer EB client.",
            "That's strange.",
            "We can consider, you know, for the future. You can, we can try a different set up which has. We could have, I don't know EB client already running from a queue, a some kind. And then I don't know FFM peg right to that so there is no connection establishing delay. Or EB client but yeah, that this at this point. They cannot be done.",
            "This picture is really is really.",
            "Yes, I mean.",
            "No, exactly, for tomorrow it's not possible to do a different solution.",
            "Yes, yes I I agree. So what I was thinking that could it be due to the quality of the video. The quality of the video is like too high.",
            "No.",
            "No, no.",
            "The connection face of EB client cannot be affected by video quality. It's not something you can fix.",
            "No, no I'm saying that maybe FFM peg is intentionally causing delay. Due to the quality of the video.",
            "But it's not FFM peg. PERSON8 PERSON8 said that the when EB client starts, PERSON8 tell me if I understood.",
            "Yes.",
            "When EB client starts, there's the end shake phase with mediator. And this probably is introducing the delay. And this cannot be avoided.",
            "Yeah, I see, so what do you - So there is the delay.",
            "Connect to the mediator then the mediator establish the pipeline and then the audio is getting process from is getting send to ASR.",
            "Please remember that everything as being prepared for face to face conferences. So, and not for play video. So I think that actually we are doing really the best solution possible at the moment. It's not possible to reduce also.",
            "Yeah, so in that case in that case the best solution is to have the machine following its own sound that we have done beforehand. So the EB client should be started all the time and it should be listening to the sound output of the machine. And we need to ensure that we run the FFM peg streaming simultaneously with a regular play of that movie. And the same video will be started from 2 like running in 2 streams. One stream would be playing it to the sound cart and the EB client would be stealing that sound output. And the streaming with FFM peg will go through the web server to to all the participants. And that will avoid the lag at the EB client start up. Because the EB client will be prepared already beforehand. And whenever someone else would say something in Czech on that machine then yes that would that would also get to these pipes. And it would also get subtitled. I think that's the safest option now. So the these the streaming from FFM peg to EB client has this lag of start up which is inevitable. And that's why we should not choose this. Ok, did I get it correctly?",
            "If you are able to make the other option working.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'll also I tried grabbing the standard output from your FFM peg command. Which is supposed to be PCM s 16 little.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I tried to play it with A play minus F S 16 underscore LE. And it was playing like very slowly. So there was a mismatch in the in the sampling rate. And I'm wondering if there is if there is any other difference in formats if it's PCM.",
            "PERSON7.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Copy and paste your comment please so so that I can check it.",
            "Yeah, it's again on different machine so it's it's not easy. But I'll I'll so for, PERSON4.",
            "I can do that.",
            "Yes, PERSON4 paste the FFM peg command and I'm pasting what I played this way. So I used A play minus F S.",
            "I think PERSON7's right about the very noise which which is being emitted in in the very beginning. Because I see underscore as a subtitler so.",
            "The file with from.",
            "Shall I paste the command in the chat window.",
            "Yes, so please do. So what I've pasted into chat window is how I played it. And the way to obtain this file was to run the command that PERSON4 will paste and that command and captured the output to this yeah, exactly. So you see these standard error being standard output to this the file with STD out. So when I did this sequence of FFM peg and playing with it with A play I heard like very slow speach. And when I tried S44 then there was some horrible noise and some, so so I was not able to reproduce the sound properly. Which indicated in my setting I was not able to confirm that EB client is receiving the correct sound.",
            "Yes, I'm going to check it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it can be.",
            "Ok, so let's I suggest to end this call now anyway. And PERSON9 should let us know any news from the electrician. And also, so there is horrible echo, can you mute yourself PERSON4?",
            "Ok, sorry.",
            "It's so annoying to be like in you have to always switch and like be in the same not be room, same machine, different machine, yeah. So PERSON9 please let us know about the electrician. PERSON9 are you here or not?",
            "I think PERSON9 is away.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "So he, please tell him when he appears reappears to let us know about the elctrician. And also the status of the segmentation worker. And between 1 and 2 we will make the decision and yeah. It's seems more likely that we'll have to postpone the demo. I'm afraid. But I think that we should give the option to have this simple and now walk over to PERSON4 to help him with the set up that I have in mind. And PERSON14 you can debug the debug the or double check, tell us how to play the standard output of the FFM peg so that we hear it correctly. Right?",
            "In order to fix it I just need probably a couple of minutes.",
            "Yeah, sure, yeah.",
            "I will write you the the commands in the is it fine for you?",
            "Yes, yes, perfect. Ok.",
            "And e-mails in order to define what tell.",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok. Yeah, ok, thank you, so I'm I'm like leaving the call now. PERSON4 will probably remain connected and I'll be sitting for few more minutes at his desk. But let's avoid any more connected machines. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "PERSON9? Is everything fine with the virtual machine?",
            "PERSON4? PERSON4? PERSON4?",
            "Hi PERSON9.",
            "Hello.",
            "Hi.",
            "I was trying PERSON4. I was trying to get PERSON4 attention. The FFM peg problem check the command PERSON8 copy and pasted in the chat. With this one actually he's able to verify that the command it's playing audio correctly. Check it please. PERSON8 has been faster than me.",
            "Oh, can you also paste it to the thing, can you also paste it to the ORGANIZATION7 doc, because.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "On the machine where I can test it. Chat is not available there. And.",
            "I was not on the call for second, so any news? Either on the electrician or on the the set up of the segmentation worker on the machine?",
            "So it seems like the succeeded.",
            "Say it again?",
            "It seems like the build for the docr container succeeded. I'm now uploading the the train model to see if I can run it.",
            "Ok, so there.",
            "And as for the reconstruction.",
            "Yeah, so I'm about to leave now but at 1 or at quarter past 1, please send us all an e-mail with 2 status.",
            "I will update you as soon as I.",
            "Yea, yeah, yeah. Whatever ORGANIZATION10 or e-mail. And it's not only the electricity it's also the the segmentation worker.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, ok, thanks, so yeah. I think that's that's it for for this session so let's let's get in touch afterwards, right?",
            "Ok.",
            "Did you paste the.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Did PERSON14 paste the the FF the FF play command somewhere on the ORGANIZATION7 doc or am I going to.",
            "Yes, yes, yes I did it.",
            "Oh, ok, I cannot find it but ok I trust you.",
            "I'll I'll try that.",
            "It's under next test session section.",
            "Yeah, ok, so we're leaving out, ok, thanks, bye.",
            "Bye, bye, bye.",
            "Super.",
            "Oh you guys are still here. Of course. Yeah, the segmentor is running.",
            "Yes we are.",
            "I'm running 2 right now I don't know how much the machine can do if you need more you can let me know or you can scale the service yourself.",
            "I really, actually I don't know how many segmentors are required for the demo. But the machine should support several instances of of services because actually it's a good one. I were fixing connection policies and I forget to finish this part. If at some point you have problem accessing the service tell me. PERSON8.",
            "Ok, so if there is nothing else immediately to discuss I'm gonna leave the call. I will keep you guys updated by ORGANIZATION10 about the power situation.",
            "Ok. I think also we can close the meeting here because we will, we are all going to leave for lunch. So thank you. Thank you guys and see you later.",
            "Bye.",

So I'll I'll comment on that. PERSON10 - Please tune, there is 2 seminars at all. Like just in a rough this Monday, both speaking, OTHER8 and, just join them. Yeah, so what what PERSON10 wrote, is where get document, That he will prepare the for the Monday seminar. I confirmed that it will be good. The Monday seminar will be done through Zoom. So I will get ready for that by follow by connecting Zoom notebook. And following the sound output of the machine itself. So we'll see, how the sound quality is degraded, When people are connected to remotely. This is also something, that would be worth measuring. So when you are bored, it would be good to, s pass the to - Well, you have not probably received the credentials for the Zoom thing, but -",
            "No, not yet.",
            "Yeah, but we we could try it, So that I would stream some of the audio files, from here through Zoom. And you would record those and then we would have like a secondary audio, Which is often degraded quality, And we would see we could measure the word error rate increase by that.",
            "Um-hum, Um-hum, Um-hum.",
            "So this is this is simi very similar to what, we, should be doing with the compression, that PERSON3 still has not provided. So that would be, that would be, good thing to try. And then try to get fe.",
            "You mean recording the audio if. Recording the audio you mean wording, whatever we hear from the speakers.",
            "Yes, yes. So you would be a participant, I would be sending the audios, So I would be - My microphone would be such to the playback to the monitor of my playback. I would play the recording, that we have from some past, Like from the the microphone, like AUDACITY base recording for example. And then, I would send that through Zoom. And you would receive that through Zoom. And that would give us a new audio. So you'd be recording your sound output. And that would give us a new audio, That we could asses the loss in in precision through that.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Yep. Okay, so PERSON10 provided his input that's good. And you did setup, it's ready, including the videos, right?",
            "Yeah, including the videos.",
            "Okay, yeah, so please,,, please here sample path to the video. So that just an as an example. Yeah, that's good. Then you have been working on the forced alignment. And are, like, w putting this more to PERSON6 right?",
            "Um-hum, yeah right -",
            "So how?",
            "Today, we have a meeting, I have a meeting with PERSON6, so I'll tell him, how to run the forced alignment.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And I'll them.",
            "Yeah, I suggest to use probably a ORGANIZATION3 document along with the call. Because he is in LOCATION4. And the sound quality is pretty bad. When he starts talking, immediately it like it degrades and and gets lost. So he can say short and easy things, but not complicated things.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And the, the chat is not good for that. So I suggest, that you -",
            "Yes, so far I have not that human the.",
            "Yes, like is another option. So, but whatever you do,, - So actually, try to use as much primary resources as possible. And the primary resources, that means, There is the README that goes with the forced aligner.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So go through that README and improve that README. So that the next person, who who has to start from scratch will have an easier position.",
            "Um-hum, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so that the OTHER5 is fine, discuss that on OTHER5. And you don't need a ORGANIZATION3 document. So we use the the primary sources and and OTHER5 to to explain if if there is any problems. That that's great, okay. Then - Okay, so you have done all the log from Mock conference. Okay. So again, please, please, put the path here,.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, I'll - PERSON4 will try to forward it to for exploration. So that we know. And then, you are doing the ASR for PERSON12 and PERSON16. That's great and you are working on SL, OTHER2 of of what?",
            "For the - Just I I mean, that I I I so that you release some data for OTHER2.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So I downloaded data ASR and I, but PERSON1 questioned me to, to doodle MT. Those ASR -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And I re I retrain ASR with MT, Than the MT and ORGANIZATION4 MT, And saying may it is kind of.",
            "Yeah, synchronize with PERSON1.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Because he is done, he has done some of this maybe himself. So just make sure, that you are in very close very close touch with him. Okay, great, that's good. And the - So not implement, just integrate. So it's, implemented by PERSON17.",
            "PERSON17, yeah.",
            "And then, logs from -",
            "Logs for for PERSON8 and.",
            "Yeah, but this is actually the this identical. This is identical to doing the OTHER2 runs.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "So this is exactly the same thing.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah it's the same thing, yeah.",
            "And logs for, Lang yeah, that is for the for the manual transcription. Right?",
            "Yeah, yep.",
            "Yep, so when doing these, please, make sure, That you preserve segment level timing. So the idea is that for forced aligner, We need to chop a long speeches into smaller ones. So when the transcribers are revising the transcript from the ASR, They should keep many of the timestamps there. And they will modify the sentences. In many cases they will have to like rejoin sentences. So the timestamps of, of a sentence beginning should not be interesting, They would have to be removed, but many will remain. So as soon as the correct sentence beginning coincides with the 1, That was proposed by ASR. We can reuse the time stamp and then we can chop at those timestamps. So by preserving the timestamps in the manual revision, 1st you make it easier to like revise that. You you can make it easier for the human to jump to the appropriate part of the of the sound. And 2nd, the sound can be broken up into the sorter sounds for the forced aligner.",
            "Um-hmm.",
            "So please, come up with the format, That mixes the segments from the, from the ASR, the sentences. And the timestamps, I suggest it would be something very simple, Like just the numbers. If there is a line, which contains only numbers and columns, It is a timestamp, and other lines are the transcript. So it would be like interleave lines. Sometimes, there would be no timestamp between the sentences, That's ne that's not a problem. Sometimes, or yes, there could even 2 timestamps after another. And no no text between them. If for example, there was long piece of silence. So so I would suggest just interleaved segments and timestamps. As the input to the annotators. Right? PERSON4, recommends to keep a seg-level timestamps in the format of interleaved a lines - some lines are text, some lines contain just the numeric timestamp. More text in a row. Yep. So okay, thanks. So that was PERSON7. And now we have PERSON1. We also hear someone, that's probably PERSON1, right?",
            "Yes,.",
            "Yes, yeah. So your your sound quality is is bad. So I'll I'll have to leave very soon myself, so please PERSON17, I wasn't in touch with your for a while, So please, briefly tell us, how is life in LOCATION5?",
            "How is life in LOCATION5? Can you hear me?",
            "Yes, it 'it's bad sound quality. I think it's because you probably don't use any headphones.",
            "Is it better now?",
            "Yes, it is better, much better.",
            "Oh, okay, okay. It was my kick. Okay. So have - Yeah. Maybe for PERSON7. I have finished the audio visualization tool.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Have you have you tried it? Does it work okay?",
            "Not yet, I I I hadn't have ti I haven't time yet, so no. Like this is my to-do list for for the next week.",
            "Um-hmm, okay, okay so then, just let me know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah sure.",
            "And I have also trained the model for for, I think it was 27, no, it was,, Basically for all the languages from from the data set in ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Um-hmm. And can we integrate this? Is it, is it the same PROJECT2, or whatever, that we have integrated?",
            "It is the same, exactly the same, PROJECT2 as the as the 7 to se as the 6 to 6 model.",
            "Which I don't know whether -",
            "Which I which I have integrated in -",
            "Okay. Yes, so please, this is another thing for PERSON7 and you. Please, synchronize on this, so that we can really use this model. And it is now the ideal time for evolution, which of the models works better. Please, include them in the evaluation of desk set OTHER2. Right?",
            "Um-hmm.",
            "PERSON7?",
            "Um-hmm um-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That's that's good.",
            "Yeah. And and also, I haven't really evaluated the models, So so well, so I will have to evaluate in on all languages yet.",
            "Um-hmm.",
            "And it is still possible that it that it is too small for all the all the languages. Because I used -",
            "Okay.",
            "I I used the very sm like I used the vocabulary of 64000 just 6 languages. And now I use the same like a vocabulary, for all the languages. So it is possible -",
            "Um-hmm.",
            "It w it won't have enough vocabulary, But i will have to to test that as well.",
            "Yeah. Okay so this is - Please, just proceed with this and do it. So the the the deadline for OTHER2 has been extended. It's the 20th of April for the submission, or f the system outputs. And the deadline for the paper submission has not been extended. And that comes only 4 days after that, on 24th or something like that. So please, if if it works, if your multi-ling lingual model is included in the evaluation, Regardless if we choose it as the primary submission or not, Please, described that as well. So please, talk to PERSON7 and PERSON1 where the paper will be and yes. And and and have the description included.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Great, that's good. Okay. And any other thing?",
            "From, I don't think so though.",
            "Yes, Tuesday at 4, would that be a good time for for these calls for you?",
            "Tuesday, I think yes.",
            "Yeah. So I'll I'll I'm trying add this actually question on everybody. I'm trying to move that from - Yeah. Move away from, from Thursday to Tuesday. And I hope, that it will also, help us to get more people here. Because well, is only only s only the 3 of you or 2 of you. I don't know, where the others are. Despite I sent the e-mail this morning to remind everybody.",
            "Yeah, I I also - For me, it was very like l very much like the day the day saw it.",
            "Okay.",
            "So usually you read the e-mails in like, later.",
            "I see, yeah yeah.",
            "And when you just said it and when you just sent it in the morning, That I'm later.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I know, I know, but it's -",
            "10 minutes after the call started so.",
            "Yeah, but it is it is actually a regular meeting. So that's, why I thought that people should be coming anyway. And this is a confirmation of regular call. So I'm now moving in to to Tuesday and and making the regular for Tuesday hopefully.",
            "Because because I I thought, that the the you would be move it already this week, When you resend the e-mails.",
            "Yes, yes, but will only PERSON1 f updated the doodle. So it's maybe others for fine with that, but still the they didn't join to - Okay. I'll - Never mind. Yep. And, and as so LOCATION5 is doing good or bad within the? -",
            "Yeah, actually actually you would think, that they would do more, More sayings the the government.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, but they were quite slow to react so.",
            "Um-hum, so. You don't have a trouble.",
            "Yes, so last week, everyone was just, yeah, well, They call it spazieren, or something like like that. Like they were taking walks.",
            "Yeah, Um-hum.",
            "Of on the streets like as if n as if nothing was happening and so. And so that would now, They are writing more more cases per per -",
            "Per population than in LOCATION8, but it's like -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And the LOCATION5 is the most infective after after LOCATION3. So there is a LOCATION6, LOCATION8, LOCATION3,, LOCATION1, then LOCATION3 then then is LOCATION5. So it's like -",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "A LOCATION7 is a -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but basically, that I I have ordered instant food. And I have food for months, so I don't care.",
            "Okay. Good, that you bought it because it will be out s foc out of supplies soon.",
            "Would I did actually, I I ordered instant food from a LOCATION2 company called ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Okay.",
            "And they make these food, That contains a 100% of everything it it it's just like dust, like flour so.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So thanks for the details, I'll have to, get, go home at the moment. So PERSON1, maybe if can very briefly say the most important parts. That's the submitted papers, thanks a lot for that again. So is PERSON1 listening?",
            "It looks li it looks like he's video is frozen.",
            "Okay. So maybe he is a promote the connection.",
            "So PERSON17, if you could document what we said.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In in in the in the ORGANIZATION3 document in to-do list.",
            "To-do list.",
            "Yes, sorry.",
            "So PROJECT1 Surge 2020 document.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So thanks thanks to all. Please, keep this, you can still be until 11: 30 on this call so. And then it will probably end. So feel free to discuss whatever it's you like and I'll I'm I'm leaving. So thanks a lot. And and next Tuesday, hopefully there will be more people. Thanks. Bye bye.",
            "Bye, bye, bye, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Okay, I'll be back here in a minute.",
            "Um-hum, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi,, PERSON1 can can can you hear me? Yes, we are we we can't hear you in - Hello, hello PERSON1? And PERSON1? Can you say something? No, no, no, no, nothing from PERSON1.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah, I can hear you PERSON17.",
            "Yeah, I have one more question.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah please.",
            "I actually forgot how to how to send, Or or how exactly do send data through through the pipeline ev client, When I want to ASR for example.",
            "And I'm not sure and I'm not sure, what are tho all those fingerprints and so on. And I don't have them anywhere written.",
            "Okay, okay. So, basically, so you want to get ASR out put from when of the ASR workers, Like our ASR worker or ORGANIZATION5 ASR worker? And I mean get the ASR put and if you did to the your, MT many to many MT. Is that what do you want?",
            "Yeah, well, I I'm just like, Basically to to have all the like possible command listed somewhere. Is it there repository, somewhere, where I can see all the commands?",
            "So that's not like a command, But we have prepared some scripts, which does ASR. And add this together, but, if you want, added on OTHER5?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can check.",
            "I think, I am there, yes. I will just have to -",
            "Yep, so.",
            "What is the name of the OTHER5? PROJECT1?",
            "Yeah, PROJECT1 OTHER5.",
            "Key. No, I just have to guess the password. Nice.",
            "Aha okay, so fingerprints.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Okay, thanks. Because I I was trying to run something through it.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "This week and -",
            "Okay, okay. At 28th you were talking what like how do get,, descripts how to get ASR and and -",
            "Yeah, I I just wasn't sure, how the call it, But but basically, I just called and it and it always just said, That that it doesn't know the language or something so. I didn't know more than to write there.",
            "Yeah, okay, then. Okay, so so PERSON1, he has,,. I think,, so for to 44, I think we are working on. PERSON1, if you like. So I'm talking, what your point number 4, Where you wrote about, evaluation of 10 OTHER8 to OTHER3. And OTHER8 to LOCATION2 MT models OTHER2.",
            "Sorry, could you said it again? I didn't hear you.",
            "Yeah, I I I I I'm talking to I'm just saying to a PERSON1. So he has internet and he was evaluating the 10, OTHER8 to OTHER3 and OTHER8 to LOCATION2 MT models for OTHER2. And I think, this is what - I I started to work, but I could not make it, completely. Because I PERSON1 - I I need to came to relay, shouldn't type the different MTs front, Give me like, from give me and yeah, ID. In ORGANIZATION4, have to be treated differently and I I'm not get time OTHER3. So now from today, I have,, all the feedback for this. And I'll be happy to, on on on this so. Yeah, that's was all thing PERSON1. So I I I I already have the scripts, which I modified from you, So I just make a few and then in data. I think, that they should. So if you have already further tasks in this data, we can. So I I would think, the, if you have anything, more,, That you,, I I I can do for you, then that you can let me know. You can could go than I think, that's all I have. And also,, PERSON1, so this week I I'll be able to fix, the a segmentor thing. Because that it's a little other branch for a segmentor division. And I did not have time to fix it. So hopefully this time I'll I'll make, I'll make some clean option the segmentor, So that really have this, segmentor. And and to some 1 segmentor instead of 2 at all. Okay, okay, okay. And and PERSON1 did the - Seriously, we were discussing to PERSON8 with regarding the segment-level. Segment-level timestamps. I mean actual audio. So did you, b will you successful, on that successfully. Okay,, sorry obvious I I works. So I'm saying, that, yesterday, we, you and E PERSON8 - We and PERSON8 we eval discussing with PERSON8. Regarding how to get segment level timestamps of the of the MT segment. As in the actual audio so. So, will you successfully running that? In getting the actual timestamp of the MT. As video time in in in the audio. So. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you tried it. Okay, then, that's all from - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, so. So PERSON17, I I have -",
            "Yep.",
            "So you have a create a many to many MT models -",
            "Yeah, I'm just going to start the evaluation on the languages now. It's just, just for technical reasons, I can do it all at once so.",
            "I didn't hear, you must can you repeat that?",
            "Yeah, I'm going to start the evaluation now, Just for technical reasons I can't do it all at the same time. So I will have to do it separately for each language.",
            "Okay.",
            "And -",
            "So.",
            "And and and make it more complicated is that the - It's basically like I think it's 42 or something language -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Like per a I'm going to to evaluated on pairs with OTHER8, if that's okay.",
            "Um-hum, um-hum.",
            "Because I because it was trained as OTHER8.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. From, or from more language to OTHER8. And then from OTHER8 to again, all the languages.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So so by En OTHER8 at the center language, You from all the 42 languages to E OTHER8. And from OTHER8 then to all to languages.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
            "And can you side the source for these, an MT - So are you using the ORGANIZATION4's model?",
            "I am using ORGANIZATION4's data.",
            "Aha, aha.",
            "But I'm using the -",
            "So the thing is ORGANIZATION4 also has a many too many models. So I I was just finding, if you using the same, Or you have trained, separate, kind of lape.",
            "Yes, so I I was I was using the many too many model, That they had before.",
            "Aha, aha, aha.",
            "But it was like totally unusable, when we tried it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I I just yeah, yeah, it recently work yeah.",
            "So so that's actually, why I I I made this fun.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "But I but I'm not sure, if it is usable on all the languages it, But I I know, that in 6 to 6 it works a quite well.",
            "Aha, aha.",
            "And they also tried it in the, paraphraser. And they -",
            "Um-hum, um-hum.",
            "May be some evaluation on it, likes, Some of their matrics, like fluency and and I do not know what, What they do there, so so probably it - They should have it somewhere in in their in their paper. I don't have it, but I am going to evaluate it on on the data, That I have myself. Oh, oh yeah, the evaluation data for - Yeah. I know, that someone wrote me something about evaluation data, But I'm not I don't remember exactly, what it was.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Evaluation. Now, we only have 5 minutes left.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so o-o on which data should I should I evaluate it? So so so the w so that we can compare it with with the other models.",
            "Which data to evaluate? I think, I'm not sure about this question. Because I didn't know the test set. I think, PERSON12 would be the the right person to to answer your question, Thus until I PERSON12 has been supervising the test set.",
            "Yeah, so - So so my question was like - Sorry. My question was what what PERSON4 was saying, About about comparing it with with other models. He was saying something like that before.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Right.",
            "And and right, okay.",
            "And so, what is that about?",
            "I'm not sure if I if I can say something to you, But is you write e-mail to PERSON4 and PERSON12.",
            "Well, PERSON12 who? Maybe I will just check the check this thing, this document, If there is something about it. Yeah, I I also received the mail from PERSON1.",
            "Um.hum.",
            "Following table issue, I evaluate some MT workers from the the. For quality, latency and flicker. Yes, so it is OTHER2 dot test 2015. Is PERSON1 here?",
            "Yeah, he is tipping and he he is here.",
            "Yes, so, so you wrote, it the e-mail about the about this. So perhaps the - And can I find the the data set, that you used somewhere? Do you have it somewhere available, like? Or if you find it somewhere, can? - Okay, okay, so so i so if I just the use it from the there, it would be the exact same data set, okay. Okay. Okay, then, thank you. Okay.",
            "So I think, if we go offline yet.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't think system works.",
            "Yeah, I don't know either.",

            "Hi.",
            "We set it up so that we use loudspeakers and this microphone. This microphone, so that hopefully that so I can actually I can leave that on. So thanks everybody for joining this call, and sorry for being this call is to agree on what we will be doing in the next two years. And I wanted this call to happen before the review because it at the review someone asks we need to have one opinion on or we at least need to know like where are the where that where our ideas differ and how do we. And if you yeah, if you look at the document, I see only two people looking at the at the PROJECT1 minuting demonstration. Do all of you have the link? So PERSON6. So can you send it PERSON4 to to PERSON6? So it was in your email, PERSON6. I dunno if you can find it. PERSON4 will send it again. So the the point on PERSON2 do you see that document. Yeah. Beyond the same well not only the page but document. It's called PROJECT1 minuting demonstrator and we me and PERSON4. Selected the first line. Okay. Okay.",
            "PERSON2 do you want to send to set it to.",
            "I just send it in.",
            "Okay, yeah yeah yeah. So here at the top of the. Not at the very top of the document oh yes. The consents with the that's what PERSON4 edit recently. We are again trying to to use this meeting as source for the minuting task. So I hope that you are all fine with being recorded and that we'll then process the data and then eventually publish as as a corpus of meetings. As type. So there is a link to ORGANIZATION4 document sorry to ORGANIZATION4 forms, so please sign in by entering your name. And and and saying yes. And this is for, this particle meeting or is it for all the.",
            "No this is for all PROJECT1 meeting I just added to the agenda because maybe not all of you are in the the PROJECT1.",
            "List so it's mainly the link is here for PERSON6. And I don't know where is, we haven't seen him today, maybe he forgot about the call but it's not too important and otherwise we have PERSON5 is not here but you can surely report to him, so that's that's. I don't see that as a big problem either. Yeah so, we need to tick off the milestone related to minut and a a its a yeah there would be about 20 months to develop this demonstrator. So this is we are just going to discuss what type of of tool we want to develop and then the development will start first person months on this are scheduled only in January next year. So there is still plenty of time to like think in your free time on this. And then there is a lot of time available to know that. Is a table which summarizes our internal breakdown, of person months as we allocated them to the various tasks related to to minuting. So to clarify minuting data is it work package one? Minuting demonstrator is in work package on integration which is is. Is yeah. That's six. And then these are five, so that's like the that's the internal that the the system our original. So this is these? I think that in in integration in work package six. ORGANIZATION1 has many more hours, many more person months than these 25 person months. The division between the various tasks of integration and and the minuting demonstrator is our internal decision. It has never been reported to the ORGANIZATION2. So you are, you have a lot of flexibility here. If you know that you are spending too much time on on other s asks on integration. We can decide for a form of minuting demonstrator that that reduces the force needed. So this is this is totally up to you to to make sure that you fit in your overall thing is obviously money. So what what normally happens in the OTHER1 Republic is that we spend more person months and less money or the same money, the allocated money on our tasks. That's because usually we are not able the salaries because there. So is difficult to to to get to the salaries. And also. Highly qualified stuff so we have more people working on this who have a lower experience. So this is this is our general reason why we spend more person months then planned but the correct amount of money. And the main point of view is is to make the division good for you. Yeah, so the that's it. So that's the the main message is that ORGANIZATION1 should sp. Like two years on this full time. Should spend a year is within the approximately 20 months of real time, because the demonstrator has to be ready somewhat before the before the of the end of the project. So that's that's that's it. And we, we have only limited are in the development of the system under the hood. That that that can fail that's pure research. But I would like overall the minuting demonstrator to to demonstrate also the user interface. So I see two main PROJECT1 so that people are happy with it and can use it for creating minutes. And the second step is the automation of the minute creation. And these two goals are more less independent they can one only one of them can succeed creation of minutes in the user interface that people like. But if our automatic minuting will fail. I would like to have good user interface where there is someone taking the notes or doing the the summarization behind the scenes. As this on users. If you wanted to, we there is no like requirement to do this but I think its useful to test it all users. So we could test it on users and we could say here have your meeting. We have this magic, automatic summarization. And while then while then meeting is happening. So this is what I would like this is what I would like to to a achieve. And what else is in the notes. Yeah the two independent PERSON4 is taking the notes. I dunno if I can open the document. Obviously we would need three machines to to to this though. Yeah. So. So this is what I described I would like to see the demonstrator very flexible for the wizard of. Job of the person should be made automatic and. Yeah so the simples implementation I always see is project with PERSON6. PERSON6 have you seen the minuting mockup figure from the project proposal? So this is something that we need to find and paste here, its not not here in the document. So can you can you locate it in the meantime. The idea is that in in my simplest setup maybe you will find something even simpler. In my simple setup there is a single shared document similar to one that we are looking at the call. That that the call more or less follows. And then at the very bottom of the documents there is transcripts by individual participants. And to have these transcripts in the ORGANIZATION4 doc can you see. So so its a shared document the this actually these two are both in the same document as no no no no. So the first part first box in the the agenda that is distributed in advance and then the lower part of the box illustrates what the document would contain as a whole. So you see that there is the agenda as well its pasted there at the top. The same and how the home user interface operates with with the background server. And the first point was to discuss whether the server will be pushing data or the client will be pulling. And then. Times different people set various things that that like matches with whats illustrated at the top so at the top you see left to right what people are saying. At the bottom you see the transcript of this and even people to immediately correct what the ASR has like messed up. So that is the transcript is part of the shared ORGANIZATION4 document I could be looking at my own recognized speech and I could be appearing there as well. In the way similar to to the chat window that that now sees the like our messages. If we are looking at our speech translated to other languages. So this the transcript, get copied and summarized like shortened in some way and they populate the agenda. And you see these round recta rounded rectangles with with the people images the agenda by this automatic minuting AM too. And it is this pull easier to implement that's someone someone mentioned that you see the person that was the first. If you like for example click this AM button. It would give it would it will show you the transcript where it comes from. If I were to implement I would implement it is as ORGANIZATION4 document or any other open source I think also has this online version now. So any other online document and. So for one for every participant, there would be one agent this agent would be connected to the ORGANIZATION3 platform and it would be stealing the transcript from myself and it would be entering it to the ORGANIZATION4 document, because these ORGANIZATION4 documents can be call. I would say I would somehow well the webpage or whatever I would indicate to the agent, this is the ORGANIZATION4 document where my transcript should be appearing and this is the point. This this worker would be would be populating the transcript in some agreed annotation with some meta data that we could include like white on white background so that does it doesn't saying like at watched time that's this was said or some ID of that segment or whatever. So that would be one agent which puts the transcript to the document. And then I would like another agent and that only once like that's at any and the other agent that would get the transcript, it would also see the agenda. And it would run our system that we are developing its not we are these months still. But we will have something which will get the transcript and it will summarize and it will populate the agenda. And this could again be done in this shared ORGANIZATION4 document with the with the transcript text and then it would locate the agenda items again some hidden IDs could be part of that. So that the location is is easier and it would populate the the agenda in the ORGANIZATION4 document. And this could be run offline or live during the session not specific with in this respect at all so we can go for the easy offline implementation or we can do it online. So in my view we need for the integration we need these and that's that's it. These agents well one of them connects to our summarization like tool and the other one connects to the ORGANIZATION3 platform to get the transcripts. Maybe you are able to come up with something easier maybe the integ my vision. And feel free to totally break it as you. So at what else we have in this document as this is. What the user inter or what the API of our tool is. Our tool is one function that you will run by clicking on this generate summary button and the function has two. Our tool will already do the topic segmentation of the agenda topic segmentation of the transcript and the meting and the population. And the output of this would be the populated agenda. So something where extending the in one way or another so that would be the the output, the output is no long is not not really well. This is maybe the output is is yeah I dunno what what the agenda shows it to. Its probably already the output. Its like visual illustration of what our summarization tool will do, but we need to decide on how to demonstrate this in in some way. Yeah okay so that's that's I think everything from me, I've described the the problems right away. What you then you we don't have to come to any conclusion today. We still have weeks to think about this, but if you see any problems right away, we should be aware of them before the review. We meant until the end of the year.",
            "Sorry PERSON8 I have. Has its own microphone or.",
            "Yes yes the freely assume this. So if if not the diarization will that that's very good point but I think that we can for simplicity we can simply assume that every speaker is not separate channel. That's that's the general way of ORGANIZATION1 being used, like its I would say I think its its rather an acception that there are more people in the call. We we can say this as a requirement.",
            "Actually. I dunno if PERSON1 ever told you about one of our products which is called PROJECT2. Is it possible for me to show with you my desktop, okay but.",
            "Please do, if if you can share your that would be great. So its next to the coffee button.",
            "Okay. Do you see me, no. Okay. Do you see my screen.",
            "White box no. Video screen.",
            "Okay. Just a second. Okay, actually this is one of the ORGANIZATION3 products which is called PROJECT2. And when I read the, the agenda of today's meeting, I understood it might be interesting for you to at least see our interface application interface because.",
            "So at the moment we see only white screen nothing more. We saw VLC like welcome screen, but we don't, we see your curs, okay. Okay yeah yeah.",
            "Nice. Just a second. Okay this is the VLC. Its a video. Well PROJECT2 is used for reporting real time reporting. Which is not at all the minuting demonstrator use case. But it has some in Italian but what what is going to happen is that someone. Also different speakers are speaking and automatic transcription. And there exist a person who introduce a speakers tag on the left bar see th.",
            "So maybe can you can you zoom so can you s make the rectangle smaller so that we see like the the font bigger.",
            "And is there a way to to hide the right hand in ORGANIZATION1 like the participants the chat and all that, because it is occupying all of my screen and I I'm failing.",
            "Just a second.",
            "Okay yeah yeah.",
            "Hide the chat with the button on bottom right. Or.",
            "With the pin.",
            "To access here. Okay lets.",
            "That's better.",
            "The size. Okay, okay. Actually on the left bar we have the speakers name's used for court reporting so that the speakers names are in this demo judged public prosecutor transcriptions start. And in the text area, and there exist user who. Performs the autographic correction and fix autographic errors or ASR errors in real time. And also introduce the speakers names, read that the agenda of todays. I saw that maybe it might be interesting to get at least inspired.",
            "Yeah yeah, thank you that's that's that was that was a good idea. This is with different this is like the first stage the stage that I was considering for the lower part of our shared document. More positions like more cursors appearing in the same area and the text will throw from all the parties at the same time, as if we were all typing to to the area. So then then its obviously like difficult how to put the timestamps there but that's that's like. Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Yes exactly now use case we have just.",
            "If it would be good idea to start with this and edit the agenda and and the summarization to this interface or not, its up. Yeah.",
            "Well actually is the document the application doesn't work with architecture, and also like.",
            "So maybe PERSON6 I would like your.",
            "And also editing the text area time. PERSON6 Yeah so I was originally not on supposed to be on this meeting. He should've joined previously on so. I think what we are going for in the first iteration we ship the audio to where it can be downloaded and retranscribed from from. Because the tradeoffs that we do with the transcriptions are more latency specific we we push a lot of a lot of into media results. That's not something you can use in in a minuting application it should only work through completed completed sentence that you can actually.",
            "Yeah yeah so. Yeah so we face the same issues with machine translation and we have ran into the same issue the day before yesterday I was I failed to send an email to everybody thanking for. I also have a some videos which I will upload to to show like that the same problem affects machine translation. So it at the there will be some component which will be making some sensibility the ASR worker. So from your point of view nothing would be changed, you would be only sending the audio to the ORGANIZATION3 platform as you are doing now. And you would not be receiving anything. Which we'll do the segmentation into sentences and insertion into into this transcript user interface. So for your point of view from your point of view I don't think don't see there itself the application. But you have the two years to work on something which will show it and now its for maybe not you personally but for PERSON5 to decide. Whether you are find the ORGANIZATION4 Doc approach what weather you would like to make use of these two years of person months. To add this capability to your own platform. So this is like kind of an offer personally I would prepare an connecting to either ORGANIZATION4 docs and even even the open source libra office. So that it is easier for other to pick up, but you have the option to use your person months to expand or add a from this yourself. The the general, this this also like is related to the general IP as it is handled in your open projects. The idea is that everybody then should like sell the results of our project we need to sell it to everybody under the same conditions, kind of including ourselves. So so I dunno how how about this but its so that that's why we always put things just to open source but for company you have to be more careful and. So th decide your for yourselves what is the best use of these two years of of person months so that you monkeys. That would do the that would do the interface based on my my requirements, so find some some benefit for you too. And I but you are responsible for coming up with the solution and and we we just need to approve that, the design of of this is also like on you you can you can have your decisions. Yeah so so at this point you like need to step out from the settings which is closely tied to the ORGANIZATION1 internals where you were only thinking about how to send the audio with low latency and receive the messages. Either of the user interface of the ORGANIZATION1 application, or this ORGANIZATION4 doc hacked with two workers. Whatever fit for you whatever is easier for and think that you have only the two years of person months to think about the the wizard of Oz usage. So I think it would be great if the if what you design and develop would work with humans behind the scenes and not our automatic summarization as well. Because then if with it, and you can sell this user interface as an independent application and the the commission would be only angry at us that our science failed. But overall as a project we will have succeeded. Think that it is nicer to have it real time, yeah.",
            "But real time is not required.",
            "Demonstrator is so maybe read again and that I don't remember it myself, but the read what's exactly as written as specification of the demonstrator. Because this is what we are going to be checked against. So read the specific, like what has to be done in order to satisfy what has been promised. So I I know that PERSON6 has never text, he has never seen that. And its too long time ago that that I I wrote it, but ORGANIZATION1 had a chance to to edit and must have kind of confirm what is what is there. Um-hum. Yeah.",
            "Sorry guys, I also had the same doubt before. So I re-read the grant agreement. Actually in work package 5 there is never written test to be real time. There is just a note in work package 6 task, minuting. And this is the only part where live is mentioned. I dunno if efficient. To require the live there are not but its the only point where its mentioned.",
            "Yeah okay, that's thats good so I think in we can always say that its impossible to do it real time with the current development of the technology. So the this kind of safe wrote to design so that it can in principle work in real time. But we happy if it does not work in real time at the moment. I know that the design decisions can be radically different for these two use cases. Same time.",
            "We have these two person years. But still we should we should somehow explain that like we should do some reasonable amount of work so at these single export is and we, copy paste. The transcript and agenda to to text areas on a webpage and then you click the summarize button and it will do something. That is also demonstrator, but I would be hoping for me. In in the end the single webpage where you have two text areas who pays the agenda you paste the transcript and you click the button and it will do some summarization. That is a demonstrator. And that means actually no time on your side. That. That that's what we are doing research into, so that's a that's this is what we have to do. So we have to do some topic segmentation based on keywords, so right now we actually. Yes. Yep, and it is totally blue so I keep reminding everybody that this can horribly fail. But the the outcome, so with machine translation everybody knows what the task is. So you get text in source language and you expect text in target language. Here the summarization has so many different ways of being handled, that I want to to have this task defined. To run shared task on on this summarization of meetings in in the coming years. So so that there the whole research moves into direction that that we want. So that's the way I see it. Full pipeline working but we can totally fail, but we will not fail what we will deliver is the definition of the ends of the pipeline, and how that fits into the the user interface. You can try to redo the internals and be in this task."

            "Yes, so – okay.",
            "And I'm sure that the mediators because I see the ASR workers.",
            "Yes, I can confirm –. The mediators –. It is the exact same session as yesterday.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And – I'm looking through the logs now. I see PERSON19 –.",
            "Yes, hello.",
            "And I see PERSON3 –.",
            "Sorry for the delay.",
            "Morning.",
            "Zoom forced mee to update, so it took a while.",
            "So in the meantime I can confirm that well –. Yeah, you know, the platform is up, the publishers are fine and –. I seem to average the top of my log –. Oh yes, that again, so I need to log.",
            "So we still don't have anyone from ORGANIZATION3, so let's keep waiting and during – during the time thanks for the –. Thanks to PERSON21 for putting things together.",
            "And I would like to check who is ORGANIZATION2ry broadcaster, If it's PERSON34 only or if it's also some guests.",
            "By the way, I can confirm that this issue, and.",
            "Sorry, can you remind me of the –. Can you give me a name or us – a fingerpring for – for our segmentors so I can fill the – fill the logs?",
            "Yes, the.",
            "Because I –. There is too – too much past activity and I –. Yeah, there are too many matches.",
            "Okay, will be shared with you. So share and slack, yeah, please check. Okay, so, I heard from PERSON23, So he says they needed to shut down their clusters yesterday,",
            "Oh –.",
            "Because there is – new logs not working. And probably they to get them started.",
            "So yes, I can see activity from the – the segmentor you just – sh. Yeah, from the –. Danny, you share –. The last activity is of –. Yes, is for yesterday, and 2: 21 p.m.",
            "2: 21 p.m. yesterday.",
            "Yeah, I see – I see the line, the – the – the last registration from the service.",
            "So PERSON23 when chance that be able to do – that the segmentor worker.",
            "And this is bad.",
            "Yeah, so the dog, the segmentor worker be to demo the Czech we have our own segmentor, Czech. And this has been a problem like since – since a long time, We – we did try to replicate the s infrastructure for segmentor in our systems like – like the –. We – we never managed to get it running.",
            "Yes, I recall, so –.",
            "Like, few months ago did manage to run the segmentor worker from a workshop machine, which – which PERSON25 stopped, If – if I remember it correctly.",
            "Okay. Okay, I – well I – I do recall we – we creaked –. We return machine in case of extreme emergency that is –. I was talking about that you bound to the return machine that was supposed to –.",
            "Yeah, yeah. The –. So we –. Basically I think we used this when there was and when there was like serial.",
            "Yes, so –. Okay, I have located this machine. I can – I can it up, but more than that I don't know – I don't know about this state, so –.",
            "It recall me PERSON36 touch.",
            "Yeah, Fe PERSON36 is not showing up, not log it's not log on and –.",
            "Yeah, so – so while we're waiting for PERSON36 if you don't have anything to work on, PERSON21 and, I don't follow you at the moment, we can discuss the agenda while we're still waiting.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, so, so let's do it. So here I started proposing the agenda with timing and essentialy the agenda will mimic what we have shown to the project officer and other users, But we will add a block of presentations for all the interesting work-packages. And this could be seen as – as the basis for our review meeting them, The differences that will have probably about 20 minutes per the work-package for the review and only 5 minutes per work-package for this user and advisory work-meeting. So in the document I'm highlighting which work is –. I think should be presented. So it's DATA, ASR, SL Team, Machine Translation, Minuting, Integration, Dissemination and Ethics. This gives us eight work-packages, eight dones, 5 minutes. That's fourty minutes, And that together with some slack-time will be an hour on presentation including the – the very beginning overview. I think we –. I could also cut the overview shorter, but I think we – if we fit it win within an hour that will be good. For demo we had 40 minutes last time and that would –. So I'd like the whole session to fit into 2 hours, And I don't know whether we want to remove some of the demos or if you want to show all. So do you have any opinion on – on this? I think we also faster with the demos in – in real run. So they actually didn'd take 40 minutes but half an hour only. I want to leave about half an hour for discussion and –. So does that sound good?",
            "Yes, I simply call that you know, grounding the demos on th last event it was really quick.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And – and, yeah, we – we didn't have that extensive of a feedback, so I – I remember –.",
            "Yeah, I expect –. Yes, that's true.",
            "Taking notes –. Just a tiny between videos and then –. You know, most of the feedback was at the end, so –.",
            "Yeah. So, there is – there is true –. The target group was slightly different. It was mainly user – prospective users, while this is mainly fellow researchers in the field. So, here we can go much more technical. And it's actually useful to go more technical, because they can hint us like what – what are bad design decisions in our system and what they're doing and what – what things should we try and so on. So, yeah.",
            "Sorry PERSON19, the work-package presentations – I'm not sure whether they're filling in, cause we've got – – time.",
            "The – the time is still here wrong, so that will be 16 –.",
            "Okay, all right,, okay.",
            "Yeah. Sic sixteen –.",
            "And this is LOCATION1 time of course.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right. Okay, go ahead, sorry.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, allrigh, 5 minutes –. Oh, sorry, the keyboard –. 5 minutes each, 40 minutes in total can extend to 50.",
            "So, if we –.",
            "If you, there will be crush in announers during the work-package presentations, so we want that?",
            "That's a – that's a big question I'm also asking –.",
            "Yeah, that could really extend them sometimes.",
            "Yeah, so I suggest –.",
            "Or not –.",
            "I suggest not t I suggest not to allow them during the presentations and to give them full – like the full package –. The – the presentations and then demo and then the discussion would – will –. While we would be showing the slide of – of the, but I know it's – that's – it's difficult.",
            "So, would you rather – would you rather suggest that we allow questions during the work-packages with planned –. So that we have 5 plus 2 minutes on average –.",
            "I think – I think if I was – if I was listening to this I would prefer to ask questions close when I heard it.",
            "Right away, yeah, that's right.",
            "But on the other hand, we need somebody then, who's going to keep time otherwise, you know – you –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You might have no questions the discussion work package cause for – for half an hour, so there just have to be someone to keep time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And be strick about it.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah. So let's – let's plan it –. 40 minutes in total without questions – questions –. Allow –. Well in – in total we allow 20 minutes. Allow 20 minutes for questions within this block. So that will mean that we will end at 16: 10 and until 16: 40 will be the demo session, so half an hour for the demo sessions.",
            "Yeah. 20 minutes –. That gives the last sl. Yeah, so 5 minutes for presentation and like 2 and half minutes on average for questions per wourkpackage. And we'll keep checking whether we're not running late. And if we will be runnig late we will postpone the questions to the end – block of questions. And what is important is that these future plans should be already included – if they are any specific or interesting – they should be already included in the work-package presentations. So each to present calls, challenges, achievements, problems – plans, problems – open problems – not necessarily all of them. So I think it's important to provide high-level overview – hig-level overview plus recent interesting highly technical details. Because this is – these are all people in the field. So the – the high-level overview is important so that they know where we are heading and the interesting technical details is what they can have comments on easily. Yeah, so let's quickly go through the packages, so that we have secure presentors and also if anybody has any idea of what should be there or what should not be there let's put it here. And then when you're working on these slides, please put the slides directly to the overleaf, which is linked below. And we'll review this early next week just without any call I s. So like direct e-mail in right. So PERSON3, would you agree to present the – the data work-package? I think it's – it's good to present this work-package because we follow the structure of the project and we are producing interesting data sets. So that's why I don't find data work-package boring as a presentation.",
            "Yeah, I agree, yeah. To present that one.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, so, yeah, you have listed a few things so we to test minuting data set and I would also add a – probably something about the space empty call this –.",
            "What do you think about the current systems, and – and I'll mention that the systems used with the demo based on this data set –.",
            "Yep.",
            "And also some working progress. Finished I think.",
            "Yeah, that's okay. So what would be the working progress?",
            "Yeah, the working progress is a crooling data from the ORGANIZATION5.",
            "So that has reports in U24E languages.",
            "So it the sa the same report and translating into languages. So that's really nice resource for –.",
            "Yeah, and dacing the main data. So I'm currently working on extracting monolingual and parallel data sets from that.",
            "Yeah, allright.",
            "So I can give – I can give a few statistics on –.",
            "The data s. The language pairs that I have data for ready and I can, yeah, talk about plans –.",
            "Yeah. So I think for all the participants of this demo session the actual domain is not that interesting and not important at all –.",
            "Right.",
            "But the domain specificity or the – the focus on a particular domain is interesting. So any techniques that we use for domain annotation at whatever level including this targeting data crawling is what we should mention. But we don't need to –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like provide then the details about the –. The domain is sufficient to say s.",
            "Sure, sure.",
            "Reports. And it's actually a mix –. And that – that is kind of interesting –. It's a mix of speech and all of its reports. So it's speech on auditing. And I don't know how do we go of all this, because we need different genre of – of the language, then then the in the domain data is.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So –. The crossover or of genres and how to deal with it. So the question is whether we simply concatanate subtitles with auditory ports and – and hope for the best or if we can so anything better.",
            "Yeah, that's the current average.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. So then for ASR we still don't have PERSON36, let's skip it and let's hope that ORGANIZATION3 will provide some presentation. Is there anything that ORGANIZATION6 is working on and they would like to add? So, soon we may or may not mention their ASR experiments, pre-training, check ASR on English moduls, which I find interesting. But it's not integrated, because it still will be window based processing and not to the extending hypothesis.",
            "So if we don't, I mean we are – we don't have any work report on ASR, we as well, so.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I think.",
            "No blem – no problem, that's good. So on SLT, PERSON9?",
            "Yeah, so, I suppose the high-level there – they're sort of. This two aspects, the SLT, this the – what we do in the production?",
            "Which I'm kind of less familiar with, but I know the but some of the details. And we rotavated their report, but the, I guess the idea of the SLT paper is quite relate to.",
            "And it is some pieces of research we added into the – the report. Particularly it was like 4 papers now on – on an SLT –. Or 3 papers, sorry –. SLT and then with the couple papers on incre –. Basically I can –. Online SLT –.",
            "Which were not in production, so I'm happy to talk about them. I mean I don't –.",
            "Yeah –.",
            "The report on the paper so I think I can talk for 5 minutes at least about –.",
            "Yeah, so exactly the – the idea is that you should pick some topic on this –.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Not necessarily within the production pipeline, and I think Okay, yeah. it's better to use the research papers, becasuse the production can be better then mention in the package.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So – so some of the papers you – you even do not need to list all the papers –.",
            "No, no, no, I mean –.",
            "Because this – this would then – this would happen then in the review presentation but not – not here.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I mean the papers are in the deliver but the deliver is not. Shouldn't be public yet, still don't –.",
            "Yes, that's right.",
            "One paper is on the review you know I –. But I'm happy with just going –. If this is ok I'll just go through the – the deliver, I'll pick some higlights, Yeah. future plans, I mean –. Our future plans are bit handled on personnel but we'd like to talk – dig a bit deeper and – and SLT –. So I can talk very briefly about that if everyone else wants to report. Because essentially, I think –. I mean ORGANIZATION9 maybe, I remember all this work-package to some extent. But we only get 5 minutes, so –.",
            "Yeah, you got me, yeah.",
            "Yeah. That was a message from PERSON36. Yeah, so –.",
            "Yeah, I think –.",
            "That's okay if we not reach 5 minutes.",
            "I think – I think it's absolutely okay if you choose just one of your papers, if you leave other partners out for – from this presentation and if you just talk about one interesting paper for 5 minutes. And at the end if you may mention that oh –. By –. Or at the beginning you can say: 'well there're other partners involved and they also do things, but' – yeah. We divided the presentations, so you'll hear of –. From others in other work-packages and there is no need to – to show case everything here.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, so, I'll mension that we have something to present in – in machine translation. So I know what –. So, well –. PERSON17 is also now working on –.",
            "Sorry to clarify just that you've written that, should I not mention that?",
            "Not so much so not, yeah.",
            "All's fine it also fits into six, doesn't it?",
            "Or actually 7, it could even fit in t word page 7 dissemination.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Shared task –.",
            "There is one package of integration, or we don't have integration report, do we? Or we didn't?",
            "There was –. It was not on the description of work, so –.",
            "That's fair enough.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's okay –.",
            "You just – you just put things together and tey work, so –.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah. Now, I suppose in terms of like selling the project it's quite a lot of work done into integrations, so we need to –.",
            "That's true.",
            "Make sure that I guess, maybe not on the PROJECT3 but at least to review and we need to make sure it's reported.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But –.",
            "The demo kind of sells it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If that works.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's a – that's a high-risk business. Okay, so, is there anything that you –. So ORGANIZATION6 or potentially ORGANIZATION3 would definitely like to be mentioned in the empty work-package?",
            "Or can we –.",
            "Yeah, PERSON3 and PERSON12 –. PERSON3 and PERSON12 have paper on multilingual empty maybe kit.",
            "Yeah –. It – it's maybe a little bit hard to explain the connection to the project without paper, because it's –. The – the main result is that they improves zero shot translation.",
            "And –. Which I –. I mean it's, yeah, tangentially related to the project. Like if we have to cover all of the language paths, maybe we –.",
            "Yes, some of them have to go zero shots.",
            "Or – or if – if you –. If it's – if it's really zero shot or if you also rely on a little bit of fine tunning then for – that for some of the languages we can have monolingual data on one side –. On the target –. So going from English into Kazach or all even the worst languages like Montenegrine or whatever. Then you will have target side monolingual data and you can have tiny little bit of English Montenegrine. And –. But you essentially want like a zero shot, because the – the Montenegrine data is so little, that – yeah.",
            "But, I mean, surely it's not all about – not all about the production system, I mean that's –.",
            "Yeah, true.",
            "It's a research and innovation project so – these are just related or not, but production is still okay, isn't it?",
            "Yeah, so I'll –. When – when working on these slides, I don't see –. If – if you have your slides ready, please, place it in, otherwise I think we can easily populate the 5 minutes with some other things. They –. We can talk a little about the document level, but what we are doing is not that –. It's – it's so hard to evaluate. Like if we don't have something we could really trust ourselves much. Or it's not like they –. The differences are not – not big enough.",
            "So the –. So, unless PERSON17 's come with something else, I will probably highlight the challenge of the document level evaluation.",
            "Hard to ec hard to see the any games different.",
            "Surely with the PROJECT3 it's also –. Okay, to highlight things they were stuck on.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Cause they might –. They suppose to be advising, they might have some advice.",
            "Yeah, but the differences are hard to pinpoint and – or summarize.",
            "Sorry, a question about the – the presentation, cause you – you them, the ORGANIZATION131 with the –.",
            "Yeah, that's the old – that's the demo.",
            "Are we supposed to fill in –. Add some slides into that, or –?",
            "Yes, you do.",
            "Yes, no great separate presentation.",
            "If you – if you had to, for some technical reason, you can do your own slides, but if it's not too big overdeal it's better to put them directly into this.",
            "Right,. Okay, okay, that's fine.",
            "Yeah, okay, so, –. Yeah, we'll – we'll prepare something for – for the machine translation and this is – this is definitely an interesting topic on its own. PERSON17 is currently focusing on something else, he's focusing on multisource from speech, but it's very much working progress, so it doesn't have any – any results yet.",
            "Okay, I'll – I'll try to produce a single slide covering – covering that – that paper.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that would be good. Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's good.",
            "Yeah, it's good thing.",
            "Okay, so –. Then on minuting –. What we will provide in minuting is –. I heard PERSON5 presenting this to group of –. Li, we had an internal mini-workshop on – on speech summarisation yesterday, so PERSON5 already has some overview slides. Some people may have seen this, but not many from this user advisory work-meeting, cause there was Luxembourg workshop organised by smart selector, whatever –. I've – I've – I keep forgeting that thing, maybe? And PERSON5 was presenting there, so we have a good overview of what we are trying to do there, and s. We –. The – the main message is that we are working on shared task in speech summarisation, in automatic summarisation of – of minutes. And we'll s take part in the call for workshop, so we'll try to have a workshop in 2021 on this with this share task. And for that we're preparing the data, so –. Yeah, I'll – I'll –. I think it's better to present the minuting data set briefly in the data work-package and here only mention again that this will be the data set. And the goal is to extract suggestions on the shared task organisation from the PROJECT3. But the problem is, that we have actually invited primarily empty and speech people and not summarisation people. So it's still one week to go and I – I'm thinking if maybe we could try to reach out and also invite some summarisation people for this. But if we don't get them, then that's not that big prolem. So on workshop invite also some summarisation people, or – or – general –. So one – one person that was mentioned yesterday by the – the – the future intern of us was PERSON16, so if we managed to ge PERSON16 that would be like person who'd brought enough experionce on the topics, for sure. Yeah, so we also will – we will cover this, on integraion –. Yeah, any comments?",
            "Oh sorry, I was just confirming.",
            "Yeah, on integration, there will be ORGANIZATION9 obviously, and do we s. Do you know if it's PERSON25 or –.",
            "I think it's going to be PERSON22,",
            "Yeah, okay. And I thing this –. I'll keep the slides on the pipeline there, because we have the pipeline and the bomb – the bombslides there, so here is the pipeline slides –. The risks of bombs, bomb discoveries and so on. And put there anything else you would like, so I don't know –. F. This is up to PERSON22 and he'll be back in office on Monday, right?",
            "Yes, exactly. So, yes, I think we're ging to make sure –. You know the – the update to the presentation platform and some other pieces.",
            "Yeah, that's good. And for the dissemination –. I don't think that we have to talk much about like public dissemination. But I think it's more important the scientific dissemination – the –. So the audible – the shared task is a clear thing to mention here. What else would you say? And – and the question is who will present this, so we don't have ORGANIZATION7 in the call and they actually didn't respond at all to this, because they like –.",
            "Yes, is anything –. Sorry. Is anything from presenting the – the dissemination to the PROJECT3?",
            "That's right, so we can leave out this work-package as – as a howl.",
            "I mean we – we have to do it for the review, but that's a different sort of s.",
            "Yeah, exactly, that's a good suggestion. So maybe if we instead –. Yeah, so it would –. Let's – let's leave out the dissemination, because we don't –. Yeah, I don't think it's – it's important to invite ORGANIZATION7 to – to join this call just to keep them there. – yeah. I don't know how to –. So the – the thing is that they have their own remote conferencing system and we are – have also one use case which – which use our systems and they actually added speech translation to their system, but they were much more happy with ORGANIZATION8 ASR than our ASR. And – and –. So they –. Yeah, I don't know if that's useful for the project to – to say this. So for simplicity yeah, let's – let's leave out the integration –. Oh sorry, the – the dissemination work-package and let's – let's mention our SSLT shared task in SLT, right? So just like one slide –. Not so much in production –. So not the – not the S – SSLT submission –. Our submission, but mention our SSLT share task, because we want to define the standard for life SLT evaluation. So, this SLT f. They – the –. The thing is to just mention that we want to do this and then we know for example that it's –. We – we know that we do not have the good measures for flicker and delay, this is still something not – not very like standardised. And we're – we're not happy with – what we are measuring there. But we would like this to grow better. And there is – there are other groups t who also run this life SLT evaluation tak, so we should sh connect to them more. And –.",
            "Yeah, I can – I can certainly have at least two slides about this,.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I can add the slide about the evaluation issue.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe I – yeah, I think I can, I can something for it.",
            "Yeah, Yeah, yeah, so PERSON19 will ask PERSON27 to provide one slide with key problems of SLTF. So the goal of the SLTF is to become the for the spoken language translation. But we're not there yet. So –. And – and – and – join in – in – in connection with the PROJECT2 test set, it really could be that thing. So, you would easily ask for the inputs, you would get the inputs from the PROJECT2 test set. The PROJECT2 test set would contain references for both ASR and machine translation and SLTF will provide the set of standard matrix over there. So that ca that can easily do the job, if – if done properly. So that's –. I think we should mention this goal and we say – we should say that the first version has been used that a SSLT share task and then people should point down all the problems and – and – yeah – help us in this – in this enterprise. So that's – so –. So the reason, or the motivation announce or cast SLTF as the sacreble for SLT, yeah. Yeah, okay, so that's good. And for ethics I will ask PERSON1, if she would be available, because this is slowly really growing the – as an activity. We'll have part-time person on that as well, because of –. We are really collecting the – the auto project meetings from – from this and from PROJECT1 and we also have the – an institute from LOCATION1 City Council, and our LOCATION1 City Hall. And we would like to put as much of this data into the research domain, so that people can train and test the meeting summarisation systems on this. And there you really are working with like life people contributing their own thoughts, to doing the consent correctly is important. So, I think that if we mention the goals and if we show our current forms of consent an our current practice, we can get some feedback, whether this seems sufficient or not to – to the others. So – so motivation have our consens practice reviewed by the PROJECT3 members. Or maybe they will provide pointers to people who know even more about the required things, the regulation and also like the good manners in this area. Okay, so that would be the work-package presentations and then the demo sessions. So here we'll again start with the brief description of the user interface, so the subtitle view and the paragraph view. So these do not need to be mentioned that much in th presentations beforehand. Or they can be if – if – if you like to, but you can also like delay that. And then we'll run the demo and then we'll leave 20 more minutes – 20 more minutes for any remaining questions or slack time, right? Yeah, so I think that – that makes a nice agenda. We have removed one of the work-packages. So –. And that's 7 work-packages, So that – that even saves us some time. 35 – – instead –. 35 minutes and questions –. Yeah, so someone is typing at the top. And yeah, I'll suggest to keep that – they are – that's three and half. Yeah, I think that's all good planned, so we need now to populate the slides and I think what is interestion to say –. So, if you don't have any further questions to the agenda and the slides that we are going to present, then I would like to try the – the demo again, right?",
            "Yeah, sorry, I – I have a question about the slides –. Okay, I – I d I don't think we're going to add more content, as we can only –. I – I think PERSON22 is going just to present it, by by speech I mean, but where should we put the slides in – in order if we – if we hava to?",
            "S well did –. I think it would be better to have some slides there, even if – if they don't have much content and I'll put there –. Yeah, so this is the – the overleaf, if you are not looking it –. You're looking at it, right.",
            "Yes,",
            "Yeah, so – so here we have the overview, it's low, the logos, the set of languages, that is iportant, the test events, that is also interesting –. And –. Yeas, so I'll – our – our architecture, so –. So I think this – this timeline of thest events fits nicely in the integration work-package actually, so –. So –. So project structure and then maybe section, if we have any sections, if that works, we –. Which one does this render well –. So I'm putting placeholders into the overleaf, and once –.",
            "You editind to – to match that with the slides –.",
            "Yeah, the slides are still a compiling for me, it's – takes ages. And I on't know if sections work –. Project structure –. Okay, so sections don't do anything here, so we have the – we have the coffee slides –. Open audience paragraph, yeah –. So, like – like this –. So this is work-package one – data –. Let's try it like that.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so I think this is – this is the way to go, so I'll put placeholder there to –. ASR – SLT –. Yeah, so we have now the – some of the placeholders in the overleaw and I think that's –. So then then there will be one on integration, Observed ob yeah yeah, so then there's the demos. Yeah, so that's – we have some of the placeholders prepared, I will finish that soon and I think you –. Is it cleaf for everybody in the overleaf where your slides should go now?",
            "Sorry PERSON19, one – one question this. I forgot, PROJECT3, could we just –.",
            "Yes.",
            "About the document.",
            "That's a good idea –.",
            "I remember question but I don't remember the answers.",
            "Yeah, so there we have the doodle poll –. That's not here –. Yep, yep, yep. Yep, the doodle poll here –. So we have one, PERSON24, PERSON37,, PERSON35, he's from ORGANIZATION1 in the Czech Republic,,, PERSON7 from the and that's it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And f yeah –. For the ORGANIZATION1, which is a Czech company, who – who do ASR and – and media monitoring –. They –. It could be maybe someone else. And – an actually PERSON15 is not available on the day of the final choice. Well that's –. So, I'll put that into the ORGANIZATION8 doc. So –.",
            "Participants of the PROJECT3 meeting, yeah –. Yeah. Okay, so are we now ready for the – for the testing of – of the demos?",
            "Oh, okay, demos check videos segmentors and –.",
            "Yeh, so let's try this first one, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I'll move –. Oh, it says my internet connection is stable, it's great –.",
            "For what is worth PERSON37 and I were – we're on the test yesterdays – yesterday and also Monday, so – you know, everything is still working.",
            "That's good.",
            "Available? It's just the workers, you know –. I think I –. That's everything is – working fine. So, when – when you'ready, please, switch to the ORGANIZATION9 presentor and – and start.",
            "So that –. Yeah, that's –. So what I'm going to do now is to present the slides, because I forgot the exact layout that the download pdf. Open it and share it. That's the screen sharing – yeah?",
            "Yeah yeah, well it's downloading, so it'll open in a second.",
            "So, I have this one, but I also need the – thou – the Firefox window to show, if I'm not mistaken.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, sharing my screen –. Desktop –. I'll share my full desktop –. I'm now hopefully sharing my screen and I'll create a new window as well. So you should be seeing the slides. Here we will go over the workpackges and I think it would be easier if I kept sharing the screen for most of these presentations and I would be moving the slides for you, right? So that we have fewer transitions of – of sharing. And then we'll get to the – to the demos, so the live demo, the subtitling of – stream videos and I should again say that we are not specialising in streaming. So people should open this link and then enter PROJECT2 at PROJECT2.eu and actually it for me –. The optimal screensize, you can reduce the font, you should allow the autoplay, which is here –. Are you seeing on my shared screen that I have my autoplay allowed?",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's good. And then the reload is for start watching the videos. So –. And –. So for –. I should – I should still go over these slides to highlight where this autoplay is to allow people have the time to set it up. And then if you cannot enable autoplay, then you will have to –. After reload click the play button and then jump to the end of – of the video. And in the lower part of –. Under the video you should be seeing the subtitles and you can choose which languages you want to see there. In some of the videos the –. The videos contain burnt-in subtitles, but these are made offline and very likely also manually editted. So you can compare that with the automatic transcript. Yeah, and, yeah. So this is it, so go to the link. Here is again the user name and the passport, remember to Shift reload for each new video. We'll be showing three videos, German short speech, which – with burnt-in subtitles, three minutes of a German lecture and Czech speech on ORGANIZATION2. And from these three we can now demo the last one, right PERSON37?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yea, so let's try it. So everybody please open the ORGANIZATION9 platform, log in and when I tell you, and – or when PERSON37 tells us, you should shift reload. So the subtitles –.",
            "So –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We can start any moment?",
            "Yes. So PERSON37 please start and everybody should be watching the subtitles and the subtitles will say to reload and at that point you will click Shift contro and – yes. So I'm reloading. I have to reload again because the –. I was too quick. Yeah, and now I select the languages and I see the logo spinning, so I don't have to click anything. And there is –. It should start the streaming and the subtitling. Yeah, so I'll keep the screen sharing a little while on –.",
            "Yeah, because the –.",
            "Because the translation is still running.",
            "Yes, exactly, yeah.",
            "So I don't know if you have watched your own s PROJECT2 platform or if you have watched my screen sharing.",
            "I was watching your screen sharing.",
            "Yeah, so the sharing –. I don't know if the video is – is lugging or if the video is okay, but –. It means that you din't have any sound, right?",
            "That's correct, I didn't have sound, but it was in Czech anyway, so –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's probably distracting for me to have the sound. Yeah, it – it ran fine, the – the video look fine to me.",
            "Yeah, okay, so that's – that's a big question. I think the –. I think we should do it as we did it, so we should invite people to open the platform, because then you have the sound. And if some of them are Czech speakers so they will see that there is a huge lack accumulating and Yeah. that's because of the segmentation. So the – the segmentor is waiting for long segments to be confident about the sentence boundaries –.",
            "And only then it is putting them to the presentation as subtitles. So that –. I think it makes the English easier to follow, but it makes it rather inpractical for like things where for example there would be slides –. So if the visual information is linked with speech in very timely fashion then this delay would be really distracting.",
            "Yeah, in this case it didn't matter, because there was just there is people talking, I mean I didn't know who was talking when the words were coming on, vut, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah.",
            "It was like two or three persons behind, and –.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Well –.",
            "There's one thing I found a little bit awkward with the English subtitles, cause there are two line s of subtitles, yeah?",
            "Yea.",
            "And changes first line and you get to the new second line.",
            "Yes.",
            "I they could be shaded slightly differently, then I'd give the –.",
            "Oh,",
            "You know what I mean, and then shade oen moves up –. So innitially it would be –. Say –. The top one is black and the bottom is grey and then it would move up and then the top would be grey and the bottom would be black.",
            "Yeah, or ground –. So the – the bottom one, the most recent one should be bright, shining –.",
            "It could be just a very slightly different shade, just like a track, because I can't see when it moves up and I have to read the words in the previous line like oh the newt line. So if we could have some – to show you that.",
            "So what you –. But there is a –. Yeah –. No, but I'm wondering whether you would prefer a kind of scrawling, so it would be line an interleaved colour so that the – the words remain in the colour and the new line –.",
            "Yeah, yeah –.",
            "That is difficult, that –. It would –.",
            "Yeah, okay, sorry, okay, yeah.",
            "Another option is that we would be adding the words and then just discarding it. So would no way to – to scrawl.",
            "Yeah, I think probably the scrwling is probably useful, it's just that –. Yeah, I need to the red one line. I need some way of following that line on the screen and not reading it again. So some kind of visual cue –.",
            "But the – the lin should remain there.",
            "I think it's –. I haven't watched enough of this, probably better if the line remains there in case you don't gt to read that all, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so, I don't know if we can insert any colour coding in – in that. I – I don't think that's – there is any support for colouring in – in the subtitle presentor.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay.",
            "And – and – n.",
            "There is none.",
            "So we will have to leave this for the next week. I mean sure this – sure this is time –.",
            "Yeah yeah, the next week is fine, just a general – just a comment for myself. I'm sure there's time to be possible –. It's not – it's not –.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So – so PERSON21 c if you can ask PERSON22 to include what is our future plan for the layout, so Okay. that's – that's what we have discussed with PERSON25 and it should be the para kind of paragraph view, so longer piece of text on the side. That's –. There is some mock images on this. So – that would be good to – to have here s in the integration work-package. So we adress presentation platform. Please include the planned layout of the view. Yeah, okay, so that –. I think this ran well, there was some some negation flip and all the possible errors –.",
            "I'm sure you noticed.",
            "The – the – the translation was kind of readable, though, mybe that was wrong, but they were kind of okay, readable.",
            "Yeah, it was – it was readable and it was mostly correct except for this –. Yeah.",
            "Like the – the happy birthday to me, and –.",
            "Yeah. I c I can't stop for herself.",
            "Yeah. Yea yea yea, there was actually he –. One of the – the – the guy who was saying this, so it was – the delay was very big. You – you didn't –.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so I think that – that's good, it – it run. So right now we cannot test any more things, because the segmentors are down, right? And –.",
            "Hi guys, I – I – sorry, I just – I just got here – got down filtring off my e-mails back from the vacation and everything is on fire.",
            "Yeah, yeah, it's normal, Welcome, it was the same –.",
            "It's literally everything is on fire because there was 35 degrees in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have just had the first demo, we have discussed the –. So the –. You are in the document as well. Are you watching the –.",
            "The document? Yes. I – I have covered now.",
            "Yeah. So what is important in the document for you is the work-package on ASR. So below this there is the overleaf link to the slides that you should edit. And we have volunteered you to present –. Or well, you can obviously find PERSON6 – PERSON6 presented, but 5 minutes of presentation of work-package on ASR. It 'up to you whether you would like us to mention our experiments with fully new ASR. The most interesting bit is that we are pre-training Czech ASR, or we are actually continuing training of a downloaded model of English ASR to get Czech ASR and that works interestingly well. But it's not integrated, because it is Window based so it doesn't have the growing hypothesis proper that we need for the integration. And you have your own –. So PERSON23 was experimenting with this, so –. You – you know more what is – what is the current status there with the integration. So, please, think about interesting content. The people who are going to be present at the meeting are listed here, higher up in the document, so you may know some – some of them. And some are Czech quys as well. And the –. For each work-package you should present – people should present the goals of the work-package, the challenges, the achievements so far, plans and open problems. Not necessarily all of those in those five minutes. So this is technical people mainly, so we need to provide high level overview, so that they're on the same with page our goals. But then we don't need to give the intermediate details, we can go directly to the –. We send highly technical details. Because they – they have the background knowledge in the area. So they need to know where we are heading and where we are stuck, what are our problems and what – what we have achieved.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so –.",
            "I'm – I'm probably gooing to look for someone else to do the care keep cause I'm not the most knowledgable person about the ASR, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, so, please make sure they – they do it – they do the slides early next – the latest, because in – on Wednesday is the session. The timing is in LOCATION1 and – and also ORGANIZATION3 time so we should start at 3 with some overview given by me and then we'll go over the work-packages. The block of this presentations should lun – run for one hour in total including the discussion on those, and then from 16 –. So from 4: 10 we have 30 minutes for the demos. So we have just tested the first – the –. Well one – one of the subtitled –. One of the stream video subtitling, and PERSON21 and PERSON37 are stuck, because there is no segmentors running. And I don't know if it's –. If ORGANIZATION3 can revive them or who is – who could revive –.",
            "I – I'm looking to it right now –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I need to se what – what service I can reach and – and where I can the I remember the – putting the – the – segmentor workers on your machine that not work so well but we do have some other machines.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, I'd like to ask – request PERSON36 if he could hand me system and getting the segmentor workers started in, because last time we tried and we didn't succeeds and we had to abandon it because we had –.",
            "Last time I also for weaker so I couldn't get them to run –.",
            "Yeah, yeah –.",
            "And we explain results to the member of –.",
            "Yeah, exactly, yeah, I don't –.",
            "I have another machine they are running on, and I would start them now, but I think –. Until I get more inside into why they didn't run on – on your machine there is nothing I can do.",
            "Okay but I – I really like it one more chance, because it's really important that we –. Because in situations like this –. Yeah, in situations like this it's important to have the – the duplicate, the segmentor worker on our cluster too.",
            "Okay, so, I think that globally we're finished. Remember here is the overleaf link for the slides and there is a placeholder where the work-package slides should go. And I'll finish the placeholders and I suggest that we keep this Zoom call running and PERSON36 can notify us when – if he succeeds with the segmentors and if we can still have the – the demo test, the dry-run for the other demos during this call or not, right?",
            "Yeah, should be just a few minutes.",
            "Yeah, okay. So let's – let's keep working on our things separately, but with this call on.",
            "Sure.",
            "So, it seems like I can get you the German segmentors right away, but that English ones I need to – need to keep locate. I started one German run now, it start somewhere.",
            "Yeah, so let's – let's – yeah, wait for little more for the English ones as well and then let's try all the demos at once. Rather than trying the German demos and then interrupting us again.",
            "So yeah, it seems like, unfortunately, I gen only get you the German segmentors right now. And we have the backup servers that are still running, but it seems like they only have the German –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The German segmentor installed.",
            "Yeah, okay, so in that case let's – the – let's run the German demo now, so that we test the German one and then the – –. Should be suggest Monday or what – what other day – or – or Friday.",
            "I should call back to speak, we can try Friday?",
            "Okay, yeah, so let's – let's plan Friday for the other – for the remaining demos. These also include the paragraph view style, so it is important to – to run them. So Friday, what time? S. Well that's whatever at eleven? Or –. Would you –. Would – Friday at eleven be – be good time?",
            "Yes, this time sounds good to me.",
            "Checking my – I'm checking the –. That's fine, okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. Run for English demos. And I will again make the Zoom call –. Cancel, my meetings, schedule a new meeting –. PROJECT2 with dry-run two, that's Friday the fourteenth at eleven. I'll again put the passport 1234 there, in the Cloud, yes. So, I'm putting the credentials to the same document. So. So PERSON37, whenever you are ready for – for the German demos, let me know.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So what you just copied, PERSON21, is for the Friday.",
            "Yes. I put it on my calendar, so I can –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm ready for the German segmentor.",
            "Great.",
            "I am too.",
            "Okay, so, I'm still sharing my screen, so we have just finished the Czech speech example and we have two German videos to be shown in the same interface, which is PROJECT2.ORGANIZATION9.com. PERSON21, just double checking, are you present during the PROJECT3 sessions next week, right?",
            "Not the nineteenth, I won't be there.",
            "Okay so –. And PERSON25 will be doing both presenting and also like helping with platform in the –.",
            "Yes.",
            "So – so – who would be the best person to ensure that else, or who – who can volunteer to to the chat window?",
            "Oh that, –.",
            "Yeah, because PERSON37 will be busy, yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So everybody please if you do not see the – you are all in the chat window then please place it there, because normally you cannot copy – you are else from the – from the screen share.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so, we are ready for the demo. I will again keep my screen sharing on, so that if you do not want to listen to the sound you can only keep watching the shared video through my screen sharing. But there will be additional delay. And if you want to have sound remember to use the tricks – the autoplay and all that in your own browser window and remember to shift reload when the subtitles. So I'm now moving to the – to the –. Yeah. So I'm now moving to the browser window and I would like to ask PERSON37 to So I'm now moving to the show us the first German video, which is German short speech and it includes burnt-in subtitles, so you can see how our ASR is working compared to manually edited s correct subtitles. So, yeah. Now is the right time to reload your web browser, so that your streaming will start. And I see that the logo is already moving, so the – the reload worked well and I can select German and I will select s English and –. I would like to watch English and German, yeah. And I'm waiting for – yeah.",
            "I don't think the German segmentor the screen is, because there are no segments and –.",
            "Yeah, exactly, there are no segments.",
            "Word translations.",
            "And also –. So it's probably segmentor's fault, because also – there is also like cashing happening, or update.",
            "If you see – yeah, if you see the presentor, like quest you would see like the text is still grey.",
            "Yes. No, no single –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Full stop has been inserted.",
            "So again the segmentor is inserting any punctuation?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. But I can see capitalisation,.",
            "That is –. I – I have no idea why that is. Like this is even the – the instance of the segmentors that we have used in the production and they have worked.",
            "Yeah, well, so let's – let's stop the call for today and PERSON36, please, keep debugging with help of PERSON37 and PERSON21 and then on Friday we will test also the German. Hopefully it will be working on Friday.",
            "Okay?",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, okay, great, so thanks to all for your participation. On Friday, whoever is available as – as watchers, please come to the call, but the call is kind of compulsory only for PERSON36, PERSON21 and PERSON37. And – and me –. If – if I'm able to – to come, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Okay, so thanks you all and keep working on the slides. If you have any questions, e-mail me, thank you and see you next week, but we'll be in touch all the slides in the meantime.",
            "Thanks PERSON19.",
            "Yeah, bye bye! That was a good one.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "PERSON37, should I keep – should I keep actually the call running so that you can use it with PERSON36 or it doesn't matter – is like it's better?",
            "Okay, yeah, well, I'll close it."

I hope for everyone got the message so can be used as,, I donno, stuff that you don't want to make, write the emails for, but should simplify communication, hopefully. What else. Ta, da, da. Yeah, I guess that that's it,. Yeah, PERSON17, how was the how was the PROJECT3 deadline, you make it? You're you're muted.",
            "Sorry. Oh, we didn't submit it.",

I thought, you know like two days before -ore the deadline but finally found out that it's not there. Can you can hear me? Because I'm a bit -",

            "Frozen here.",
            "No problems. Okay, so there's that,, n well, than if I'm if I'm correct than the next possible deadline is the ORGANIZATION5,, in,, exactly 30 days. No,, a little bit more than 30 days, so. I donno, do you plan to resubmit or not resubmit? Try to submit it for the ORGANIZATION5?",
            "Yeah, we would like to submit it,, to the ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Like prepare something. So n just now we had some like discussion with PERSON21.",
            "Mm-hmm.",

            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And it's it's that instead of,, normal processes that you first back-translate, like the some suggested process by ORGANIZATION1 guys have used that for pre-training you back-translate or train on back-translated data -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And then you finetune on original data. And,, instead of back-translated data we wanted to use the paraphrases, which are done by back-translation -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But,, with the constraints, so that the paraphrases are the most like distant from the original, originals. Yeah, and so the hypothesis was that in this way, we can get like better score when when we pre-train it that the source is more distance from the original.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Or like the back-translated source is more distant from the original, on which we finetune later. Okay, I don't wanna to dis I don't wanna describe it more, like I have some numbers from it, like interesting findings or some like observations, because I we also,, tried PROJECT4, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And the interesting thing is that,, it actually ignores the second source. When 1 of the sources is orig, or original ou input.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah, so now we have to like investigate further, how to change it or and when we change it, where it's going to be better or it's gonna be sub-optimal or something, yeah.",
            "Okay,, I guess,, can you please fill it like in 1 or 2 sentences into the doc so we have the, notes about it?",

            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And,, they didn't get back to us over the weekend, but I guess that's okay, so we gotta just wakin waiting for them and we expect that during this week we get some reply. And hopefully, they'll say that everything is okay and they'll start doing the experiment but. I donno.",
            "I h I hope that next Monday we will least know that they are starting to do their part, right. But yeah, is good to hear that,, we have everything done. On our side.",
            "Yeah, I like last week I just sent them I'll. So I push the ball on their side and,, they told us that they will check it and told us that it's not a good idea that, to add another machine translation system for,, Czech-English. Yeah, we also think is not a good i. Like because, in his way, we need to have more participants to cover -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Like sufficiently all of these MT systems. But still, I think we can run it. And when we find what we w like enough about those,, PROJECT9 systems -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "We can switch them off and replace them by the PROJECT8. And li I mean like in the exper like when the,, experiment's already run -",
            "Okay.",
            "And running, and so I just told them to start and they yeah. So I prompted them today and they haven't replied yet, so.",
            "Mm-hmm. Okay, so -",
            "Let's hope that ch they will check it check it,, as soon as possible and do not do not refuse to do it because of whatever.",
            "Yeah, that's that's good, I guess,, if they don't reply until Thursday or Friday it would be nice maybe to nudge them a little bit, like whether -",
            "I, like last week in the email I sent I like I told them that we would like to aim it to the ORGANIZATION5 deadline.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So the statistics or the experiment should be done by the end of the August, so.",
            "Okay, that will be nice, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so let's let's say that that's fine, it's going according to plan. And agai.",
            "Well, according to plan, like -",
            "Oh.",
            "All this experiment is it's -",
            "In progress for like 8 months already, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. According to current plan, right. So.",
            "Yes.",
            "Hi. Muted still.",

            "Oh,, it's it's hidden, yeah, yeah. So yeah, we were just talking that the Taco is currently been,, sent to ORGANIZATION1 and we are waiting for response and,, the. Okay, maybe PERSON11 is oh, it's fine. Okay, so and,, the PROJECT4 was, er, is that the plan is to try to submit for ORGANIZATION5 now. Like, er, er, they didn't make it for the PROJECT3.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so long story short for PERSON11. So we found in the end, we found nothing interesting in the experiments that we have run so far.",
            "What?",
            "I can -",
            "I can I can send you details in the, or like write down the details o to the agenda, and also send a link to the table where we collect results and maybe you will find something there, but. We have some i further ideas which is like with that which should what that we want to try, but yeah, so.",
            "Well. How come nothing interesting?",
            "We want to retry it for ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Yeah, but, but how come nothing interesting? It's, because it's all as expected that the,, s, quality estimates are totally useless and. Or what,.",
            "Wh wait to quality estimates there was nothing. No, -",
            "So I'm I'm maybe I'm confusing it, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This is with PROJECT4 translation and -",
            "PROJECT4, okay. Yeah, that was the paraphrases.",
            "Yeah, paraphrases. Yeah, so -",
            "Mm-hmm, okay, yeah.",
            "Like they were like two branches,,, one was data augmentation and the other one was like truly PROJECT4 translation, and yeah, so like in the first part. With like we had better numbers but in the end, this was still like in the process of learning, and on Sunday after the deadline, I had even better numbers. So it wasn't ready yet for like in the time of deadline.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So we would we would have claimed something that is not true or. Yeah, so.",
            "Well,, not the full truth, not as good as a -",
            "Not the full truth, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And,, with the PROJECT4,, it happened that,, like when we train it,, it's it's just decides to ignore the other source. And so now I'm investigating how to force him to take advantage of both sources or like 3 -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Not to just rely on 1 source in the end.",
            "Yeah, -",
            "So if like I -",
            "And that so the true PROJECT4 is what data set?",
            "It's, it's originals, and to these originals, I create,, paraphrases by ParaBank rewriter, yeah?",
            "Yeah. And -",
            "And so if if I replaced the par. Like in when I train the system. And if I replace ORGANIZATION3,, input with shaft ORGANIZATION3 input or blanks, empty file -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "It just remains the same.",
            "Yeah, so I think -",
            "And if if I do it and, the other way, so I replace the originals with empty, so it just translates to empty.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So,, in the training phase, I suggest that you do the same thing,, that you also,, delete,, the original channel and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "S train to only 1 ORGANIZATION3. And also that, the question is whether,, you want to make it positional, so that the first encoder is always empty or the source,, and the second encoder is always ORGANIZATION3 or empty, or if you want to swap it as well -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So that ORGANIZATION3 can appear in the first encoder as well and the original can appear in the,, second encoder, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then -",
            "That's how I wanted to try like to try to swap it but I'm afraid that then,, like the final score would be like 2 BLEU points lower than -",
            "It's possible. Yeah, but it's it's, -",
            "And if I then if I train on originals only. So that's my impression ot of what happened so far.",
            "Yeah, that -",
            "I haven't tried these experiment yet, but yeah, I'm going to try it but this is what I -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Don't like, it's -",
            "So only disabling it during the training so that you keep it positional and it know it learns that it should trust primarily the, the source, the first encodator -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And only if it's empty it should trust the second one. That is, I agree that this would probably get a higher BLEU score. And I would do one more thing, and that would be,, damaging,, the, either of them,, so I would actually replace,, content words, for example, or start with totally random words replacing random words to the random words,, in the source channel. So one of the channels should contain the good information, one of the channels -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Should be damaged. And it should learn to,, like,, k recover from this. And,, the question is what types of mistakes,, we should create in the data. So,, it should be primarily,, mistakes which are possible for the human user, so that -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "The human user coul. I would probably start with typos, so,, talk to -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "K,, correct, who is the author of corrector, PERSON10 Na, no. No, not PERSON10. The er, PERSON16?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So get in touch with him, because he and PERSON19 I think, if I'm not mistaken are working on,,, like automatic creation of, or it may be already,,, Ja PERSON14,, cooperators of errors, or a system which creates errors. So,, we could damage one of the sources and lead the other one okay, or damage both of the sources,, but in a different way. Like randomly, obviously, but they are different already. And then it sh it should learn to merge this information, so -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "I would suggest noisifying the training data.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "By the way, the corrector, I think it's PERSON5 and PERSON6. With PERSON7 -",
            "No, that's the old one.",
            "Yeah, okay. Okay. So yeah, it's bo it's possible that PERSON16 is actually working on something similar.",
            "Yeah.",

            "So please ask him and -",

            "So yeah -",
            "Don't feel bad about like the missed PROJECT3 opportunity,, but it's, even if we miss a deadline it is useful because it has pushed you towards,, actually getting the thing running, getting it trained. Yeah, so it's a pity but not too bad, it -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "It progress, you are making progress.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe,, PERSON17, you're, okay, you're at work but you're, right? This week. Or recently.",
            "Yes, but tomorrow I'm planning to come to LOCATION1.",
            "Okay,, well, I'll return to LOCATION2 on Tuesday -",
            "Oh.",
            "Evening, so -",
            "On Tuesday evening.",
            "Yeah, but okay. Okay, but we can -",
            "Okay, so I can come on Wednesd or I can come to LOCATION1 on Wednesday, I just want 1 day go to LOCATION1, so if you are there on Wednesday I can come there.",
            "Yeah, Wednesday should be fine.",
            "Because on Thursday I will be in Slovakia already, so.",
            "Okay, I'm just interesting in more of the details to -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "The yea you know, to -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Er, so I can also start thinking about it little bit and maybe trip in -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "With ideas.",
            "Yeah, okay, like no problem and maybe I would also enjoy like somebody will like help me helping me with this, because yeah -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "We are working with PERSON21 on it, but he will slowly -",
            "Well, he is officially employed by ORGANIZATION1, right, so.",
            "Yeah, and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's that's so I think he'll slowly back off from the from this,, project, then yeah, we he promised me that we should finish it but,, like maybe the experiments that we want to finish and not some like extensions.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, s.",
            "There could even emerge,, IP issues. So, I've switch off my,, camera because I'm,, starting to -",
            "That's fine.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Okay, so maybe if that's everything,, I just want to mention PERSON11, I created the Zoom, I sent the email and hopefully, we will be using it for some,, more like technical stuff, something that you know, it's just -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Too much to write an email in my opinion. There was a question whether we use it for conferences, but basically, we decided not to because I donno if it can record and whether you even can make create conferences there.",
            "You're talking sorry, you are talking about ORGANIZATION2, not -",
            "ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Not Zoom.",
            "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I meant.",
            "Yeah, exactly, I was confused.",
            "I meant ORGANIZATION2, yeah, yeah. Okay, sorry about that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So PERSON17,, you actually looked into that,, you cannot have a call of more than 2 peopl, more than -",
            "Oh, just somebody told it during today's lunch, I think PERSON9 or someth wha that you can't have more than th 2 people in the call -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "When you are have the free version -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And you also cannot share the screen or something like this.",
            "Okay, well, I was wondering whether we can use ORGANIZATION2 at least when I call to PERSON4, it's PERSON4, right? I always mess up the manes so I sorry. So,, I don't know, if we are going to call like,, we the 3 of us, so it we cannot use it, I guess.",
            "You say using ORGANIZATION2? For the -",
            "Yes. Because sometimes. Well, there were some issues with my connection on Whatsapp, so maybe ORGANIZATION2 may solve it. Well, we can try it, n I don't know, tomorrow or something.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "If it would be just bo,, just me and PERSON13, we can do this -",
            "Yes.",
            "Only by ORGANIZATION2, but if -",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON17 will we'll be together we can try through right Whatsapp, right?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "That-s no problem.",
            "Well, we would we would we would use the Zoom might be bet definitely better, but Zoom is reserve only for this time, so we cannot actually use this room for the for the, er, lunch meetings, right. So. But it's it's it's okay, I guess. So a last thing is,, PERSON4 is trying to,, install PROJECT8 for GPU. We are currently he has he has run into some issues with specifying CUDA libraries. And we are trying to solve it. I'm not sure PERSON11, I've noticed that there is a in the PROJECT7 directory, there are several PROJECT8 subfolders or subdial subdirectories.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Do you know anything about that? Or I guess we should ask PERSON2, right, he was compiling it.",
            "Yes -",
            "He probably has,, the best experience.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like I'm I'm not completely sure,, what are the issues will with the CUDA compilation -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "In PROJECT8. The CPU version was fine, right? You were you had no problems. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I just ran the script and -",
            "And does it -",
            "It worked.",
            "Does it fail in the during the compilation or already in the configuration or like generating a Makefile by CMake?",
            "It's a.",
            "Yeah, go on.",
            "I'm sorry. Yeah, but,, it was not finding CUDA and on the final,, C,, I think it's CM, the CMake command.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And it even though I'm I'm using I'm passing the Parabol, the path to the to the correct coder,, it doesn't find it,, I don't know why.",
            "And so and so you compile it logged into one of the DLL -",
            "Actually, I was using Chronos because, -",
            "That's a different, that's a different machine, so they differ in co hulp hardware configuration.",
            "Yeah, I explained that.",
            "Better to go to some DLLs or TDLLs because Chronos it's -",
            "Okay, yeah -",
            "Like outdated.",
            "PERSON13 told me to do this today.",
            "So the thing is -",
            "So I'll try this.",
            "The thing is that I think it should be it's a good experi like exercise to compile it in Chronos, because the issues were with finding the correct paths. I think the problem is, and again, we still haven't figured it out, but it might be that even though,, PERSON4 specified the correct root directory, where the CUDA is installed, it the Cmake libraries cannot really find the subdirectory structure, because it couldn't find the NVCC compiler, the N the Nvidia compiler, right. And it is located in those subdirectories, so there might be problem with some path name resolution or something. But -",
            "Yeah, I'm making something wrong.",
            "Yeah. So until we resolve that, I told PERSON4 that he can try,, running training on the TDLL, because in the PROJECT7 project directory there is already PROJECT8 compiled against the TDLL 5, so it should be working if it's compart correctly. So -",
            "Yeah, I didn't try yet, but.",
            "Yeah. So we are sort yeah, so it's progressing, I think you kinda getting used to working on the cluster, I think you have all the access that you need, so it's fine and it's it's it's alright.",
            "Or there is or I can link you to my PROJECT8, which is not my PROJECT8 but PERSON21's PROJECT8, so. Yes.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you want to train -",
            "And -",
            "Something, so either use the PROJECT7 or ask me to or I can link you my.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I -",
            "And once you succeed -",
            "Mm-hmm? Sorry.",
            "Just please, please remind me once, once you succeed with the compilation, what is the goal,,, what is the first task to deal with,, once PROJECT8 is compiled?",
            "P k or, currently I think that,, that's good thing to do is,, to try train,, some larger or you know, reasonably large model on GPU just to get a gist of how to actually set up the environment variables. And how to a co n check that, er, even though you're on a GPU machine, that you are actually computing on GPU and such like you know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I do know that there can be problems with that, so.",
            "These are still like,, toy tasks,,, we haven't - Yeah.",
            "Yeah, actually, you told me to train with Czech-English data set, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "And -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "I will do that -",
            "Yeah.",
            "As soon as I fix this -",
            "Yeah, mm-hmm.",
            "Or I start using the PROJECT7.",
            "And I can link you also to the hyperparameters that I used for training, it's cause -",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "I haven't figure out them like myself but also copied them from PERSON21 and he copied it from ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think those para like hyperparameters are -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Proved to be optimal or something.",
            "Just one thing,, that I wanted to mention,,, I my Ph.D. student PERSON4, who is in LOCATION2 in person, also has,, just, will be starting to compile his own PROJECT8, so please,, if you can, PERSON13, if you can,, email PERSON4 just -",
            "I guess -",
            "PERSON4.",
            "Or like let him -",
            "But I think -",
            "Let him know that he can turn to us.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. That's the -",
            "I -",
            "It's the phrase, right?",
            "I told him, but I think it could be also useful if,, PERSON22 and PERSON4,, would be,, also directly connected, because they will be t running into the same type of types of issues.",
            "Yeah. But just please le like,, push him so he contacts us, er, because well, it's in his own interest, right, first of all and second of all, I might -",
            "I told him already that he can contact you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'll I'll t I'll t, repeat it again, so that he really does.",
            "Okay, okay, that's that's fine. Okay, so this is the technical stuff. And I guess, hopefully next week, we can start talking about plans for the PROJECT6. Like currently the thing is -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We need to look up,, some,, related work we can start like build on top of it or something like that because I currently have,, only limited knowledge about the state-of-the-art. I know that Mi PERSON17 was,, mentioning some papers, like at least with,, relation to ORGANIZATION6. So maybe -",
            "You mean the constraint, -",
            "Yes, yes, there's the those ones. So yeah, I think they are already linked in the doc or not. I still need to read them, at least skim through them, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah, we can we can.",
            "I read them. There are 2, right? And -",
            "Yeah, okay, so yeah, so that's good. So I also -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Try to try to catch up and yeah, we can start brainstorming about the possible, -",
            "I have to I forgot,, to write to PERSON12, I have to -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Ask him about. What's the -",
            "Well yes.",
            "Status of implementation of,, those col co these constraint decoding in PROJECT8 and how can we improve it. Because if I understand it or remember it correctly, it only. But, so, yeah, I have to write him.",
            "I lost the end, I donno if -",
            "Yeah, he's go he's going to write to ORGANIZATION1 -",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "What's the status on the -",
            "Yeah, about the about the code, right? But,, it there's a better version of ORGANIZATION6, right? There's a -",
            "Yes, but the thing is that we would ideally want to work with,, PROJECT8 because it's definitely going to be faster. And I still hope that we will not focus on the,, like im developing new technologies, but like let's let's work with the data and try to figure out how we can exploit the constrained decoding techniques. As they are right now.",
            "But if it's not implemented in PROJECT8 yet -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So then we have to either for s PERSON12 to implement it on or like that's really compli this will be complicated, or rather implement it ourselves.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "And I wouldn't go for ORGANIZATION6 yo ei n like even though it's already implemented there,, ORGANIZATION6 is slow to train, or much slower. And yeah, in the end, we have to all work with PROJECT8, so. As soon as we like change to PROJECT8, so it will be better.",
            "Well, okay. So another thing I will look exactly what is the deliverable we're supposed to deliver in, let's say,, 17 months, for the PROJECT6. Because I don't think that we actually promised a. Like the constrained decoding should not necessarily be the part of the final product. So as long as we have some interesting research with results we should be fine. But -",
            "Okay.",
            "I need to double-check on that. And in that case, we have much more freedom because we can we can implement or experiment in whichever framework we want to, so -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "That's it.",
            "I am sorry to jump in, but -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "I have to go, so,",
            "Yes, definitely.",
            "I -",
            "Yeah, I th I think I think that that should be everything, right? There is nothing else to discuss. Or nothing urgent like at least,, if you rem, like, forgot something you can you can send an email to the to the,, PROJECT2.",
            "ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Yes. So I think it's fine, so I guess let's let's cut it here and let's see each other next week.",
            "Okay, bye.",
            "Okay? Mm-hmm. Bye.",
            "Byebye.",

            "Hello, hi PERSON13. No. Meetings. Hi. Hi PERSON5. Yeah so, can you hear me? Can you hear me?",
            "Yes. Ok. And PERSON16 is also connecting. That's great. Okay. And PERSON11 and PERSON16 so you are on the same machine with PERSON4 or on a separate machine?",
            "PERSON4 is next to me, can you hear me?",
            "Yeah, we can hear you.",
            "PERSON4 need voice picker. Do you have it there PERSON9.",
            "Yes okay. PERSON4 can you go to PERSON9 and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So he's going.",
            "Yeah. So we are now in in a second, I need to hand this over to to PERSON4 our new colleague. Who will be working on PROJECT2: And as soon as PERSON4 connects you will also see him in in like in the picture at least. So since PERSON16 is starting his PHD studies I would like to relieve some of the like technical duties of PERSON16. And that is why we were lucky to get PERSON4, so in a second, he will join. And for the dry run in LOCATION1, this will be the first opportunity for PERSON4 to get and get acquainted with everything. But from now on I would like PERSON4 to be like the most responsible person to be like supervising the whole system as PERSON16 was has been doing so far. So that's the an introduction of of new person. And then for this call, I would like PERSON16 to lead the call, and you know that the live event is happening in week and a day from now. So we have just a seven times 24 hours for any preparations. So that's that's very limited time, an during that time would like,, some like dry run to happen. Maybe Thursday, or Friday. This is up to you to decide. And I would also like primarily PERSON4 but with the help of all of you to scrutinize the bugs or limitations that we know. And that we have recorded in in our ORGANIZATION8 document from the last session. I don't like any. Any of the bugs any of these bugs will be resolved or fix by next week. But we need to to like remind ourselves of them, and, work on fixing them at least, by designing test cases that that that reproduce the bugs. Yeah, so this is slightly the very overview picture. If you are looking, at the at the agenda for the call today, reminder of the coordinates it's in LOCATION1 next Wednesday. Is anyone interested in coming to LOCATION1 or not, I expect I don't expect anyone, but I have to ask. Yeah. And the setup is there English and respoken English. And we should be quickly able to. We should be able to quickly switch between the two. So this this us for me. This is the main challenge for, for this event. I would like to have the setup to be flexible enough so that we can easily, change the source language. I'm less interested in in. Well, it's also something that we are testing. But, that is not the main target for me now. The language is that we are covering. So I expected that we will launch all the systems that we have. If there is some languages that we don't have. Then well, we will not ham not have them in the subtitles, that's that's okay,. But we should set up. We should test the the full setup as much as as many languages as we can. Still the main thing to should be the switching between the different sources as one of the English streams would be better or worse. So that's that's my my goal for that,, as I said please pick test run session. I would suggest for Thursday or Friday.",
            "This is not good for us.",
            "Okay, so what day.",
            "Thursday is national holiday in Germany and. In Friday off.",
            "Okay, so tomorrow.",
            "It has to happen this week then tomorrow is the only day.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So what what are your options. So Wednesday, at what time what would be the the best timing. So PERSON16 when are you available? I'm. So I'm not available in the morning, at all, but I don't have to be there.",
            "In the afternoon.",
            "Yeah so what time.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yes yes, we can hear you.",
            "So in the afternoon? Let's say at one.",
            "So would that be okay for everybody.",
            "It would be good if everybody will be available on slack, I think that we don't need live calls very long.",
            "Wednesday afternoon is okay for me.",
            "Yeah great.",
            "Fine, so I badly I didn't get any before this so.",
            "Yeah so, we have only agreed on the test run which will happen tomorrow in the afternoon and everybody. Yeah?",
            "Do you need people from ORGANIZATION10 I don't I think I'm gonna have trouble joining tomorrow.",
            "So we need the systems running. And we need response if the systems are not running as expected.",
            "Right right.",
            "So I dunno if PERSON11 can.",
            "I can start the systems today. I'll be able to check slack some with the if we are starting at 12. UK time tomorrow, I can check for maybe a couple of hours.",
            "Yeah. Okay so that's that's it's an acceptable time. That that's good. Okay, and then. Yup.",
            "We as ORGANIZATION2 we are lunch at 1 so we would probably back at one, one and a half. You know one thirty or two.",
            "Yeah yeah. But essentially everything is running from your point of view, so there is no no involvement should be necessary.",
            "Exactly yes. Yeah everything is just still running.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It will be running.",
            "Yeah, one important question is not for the test session but mainly for deliberate session know, whether it is different workers and different mediator. From the ORGANIZATION6. Because we don't want to the ORGANIZATION6 sess the ORGANIZATION6 session to im to suddenly interrupt the live event in LOCATION1. This is something which is critical. So is it different setup? Or the same setup.",
            "The mediator is actually the same. We can setup a second one if if you want. We. We'll have to see, if we do all workers will will have to register to the second mediator so.",
            "Hum. But then the the benefit of having a separate mediator is that we clearly see which workers are available where. And if overall one of the sides is short of resources well then, we have to like somehow compromise the the like scale down the setup. But it the clear the two setups are clearly separate. So it cannot happen that suddenly the ORGANIZATION6 setup would would break and and steal workers from the LOCATION1 setup. So this is something which I would prefer. I dunno what what everybody else thinks. Yeah so I, yeah. Everybody is quiet so I suggest that we indeed should use different mediator right?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Testing echo, it works.",
            "What. Yeah yeah PERSON2 we heard you what yeah. Mediator. The question is whether the test session should already run with the new mediator. And I would suggest it should. So.",
            "So okay, we. Okay we already have we have a different, separate I dunno if we can use that. Alternatively we can add a second instance machine.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And use a different set of ports, so the switch should be extremely fast. I don't think I think one mediator to our machine will impact performance.",
            "Um-hum yeah.",
            "And so yeah, I just need a quick meeting as a ORGANIZATION2 and then we can set this up. And we we we select ports we have. And share them with everyone.",
            "Yep, thank you. So this is this is a message for everybody then. When you are preparing the workers, the details of the mediator will be available here in this ORGANIZATION8 Document, where I just asked PERSON13 to enter the details.",
            "Which ORGANIZATION8 Document is that?",
            "PROJECT2 okay that's important. So you don't have the link, do you have the link for the remote for for the review yeah. The the document that we are looking in the morning at. So I'm just pasting the link there sorry that was the wrong place where I pasted it. Technical call. This is the correct place. So here yeah. That's. And to make things clear this PROJECT2 second dry run LOCATION1 is our only document that we will use for the for the LOCATION1 session. So every all the questions all the preparations all the setup for LOCATION1 will will be only in this single document. Yeah so. Let's now very quickly go over the languages. Because PERSON11 probably remembers by hard which target languages his models support. Do you PERSON11?",
            "Okay so we definitely have Hungarian, German.",
            "Yeah so.",
            "I think Polish.",
            "So Hungarian, impossible to read it. I'll make dark or no no no highlight green. So Hungarian, German, Polish.",
            "Yeah, Spanish. And. I think that's it. We may have, we may have the other languages but just, we don't translation system.",
            "Yep, so please. So I'll just mark this as updated. So. Yeah so PERSON11 once you. I've asked you in the document to to highlight the languages that you can support. This may be important for ORGANIZATION2 so that they know what languages should be in the subtitling platform. And there is also one thing which is not discussed here yet, and that's the subtit sorry the streaming of slides. Slides streaming setup. And this is something that PERSON2 and PERSON19 put together in LOCATION2 during the the PROJECT1 session. And essentially, we don't know how to reproduce it or I dunno how to reproduce it. So PERSON2 are you here? I'm not sure if PERSON2 is listening, he seems to be present on the call but. Okay yeah, so the question is whether he has dug out the scripts the the setup for recording and streaming of slides to the to the presentation platform of ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Sorry what? Streams sorry slides whenever stream through the mediator, they they were streamed directly.",
            "Okay well, yeah, so I didn't know. For me it appeared as as yeah as in the presentation platform, so PERSON2, are you going to take care of this in LOCATION1 yourself again or. Should someone else be working.",
            "I asked my colleagues to prepare all the computers in the room and well I have to tomorrow and Friday to do it so. Yeah hopefully.",
            "Okay, yeah. And this is not related to any of our tests, so this is to be tested only in LOCATION1 right? Like yeah. Internal you will test it at at ORGANIZATION4 premises tomorrow or on Friday or but then this will be tested only in.",
            "Small problem, ORGANIZATION2 to change the URL which the media is taken but that should be.",
            "Hum, yeah.",
            "Yeah exactly should be a it it is just one parameter on the presentation platform.",
            "Okay yeah, so at this point I will probably like leave the call myself, but PERSON16 will be still be here right PERSON16? Is your connection stable now? And I would like everybody to walk through the list of critical observations and that's that's what we have here further down in the document. One of the the critical observations is this question by PERSON10 and for each of the problems that we had in the past please discuss whether we are running into the problem again. Whether we have a test case for this so like test unit test for that so that we can reproduce the problem. And whether there is any chance to to fix it and how critical the problem is for for the overall setup. So as I said I'm not expecting these problems to be resolve for the LOCATION1 event. But I expect them to be fully resolved in some way for the ORGANIZATION11 congress, so that's that's what we are aiming at. LOCATION1 is for us, there will be live people live people but they don't need us at all, again its only our our test case. The ORGANIZATION11 congress is the reverse, we will be kind of needed there, yeah.",
            "And since the test case are we are we sure we gonna gather all the data. That we need or that we can gather.",
            "So what what data you mean?",
            "Yeah, I suppose basically all the audio, can we gather the can we keep the audio.",
            "This is something that ORGANIZATION4 will again have to decide in the retrospect. But we will be recording it, so that's something that we normally run PERSON16 will make sure that the recording is is happening.",
            "I guess basically the audio and then all the outputs components along the pipeline.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Segmentation the MT and so on. I don't I'm not really sure how I mean we can we can record sounds of the MT but. Yeah, I'm not sure how well we'll setup to to capture all of that. It is hard to say at the moment will be useful but. You know as much we can capture and then if we have to do some hacking and processing to gather data that's okay but.",
            "Yeah, so we have collected our logs from the PROJECT1 session but I'm not sure if PERSON16 ever had time to like organize them. Do PERSON16 what is the yeah yeah exactly. So we have them somewhere so. I think it's important to to have like clean collection of things that are repeatedly usable and that will be whatever tests or or test sets we we create from that. So this is we are definitely going to record the audio, because this can become a basis of of a test set. The logs are useful like for immediate debugging but later on its better to always work with the live instance and debug the your actual current code. So we need what we need is is the input and maybe kind of expected outputs. So that we can run cruise control over the whole setup in in some way. So I'm your question was probably aiming at like the the interaction between the ASR and machine translation. And also the the final presentation of the subtitles because we had the flickering effect, PERSON16 remembers. So there is there is many things that that will go wrong because of the components are not exactly like well well seem together.",
            "Audio then we could we could even just replay parts of the conference, and replays since what happens.",
            "Yes yes yes yes. So we can do this already with the with the recordings that we internally have for for from the PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So this actually this LOCATION1 event comes for us a little bit too early, like its but its that's life. So let's let's just make use of this gather some new problems observe whatever still wrong. And then we'll keep working with just the recorded audio over the coming months to to polish the the pipeline.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Okay, so if there are no questions on me then I'll I'll disappear and please go over the over the problems and discuss how important they were and and how to best resolve them and all that.",
            "Yes yes, I have a question for you PERSON9. PERSON19 asked me if if can have an official recap. By you instead of I be I have been taking notes, but it would be nice to have an you know an official minuting let's say. A recap by mail from you so.",
            "From from. Yeah and and he mented specifically for this call or all calls or whatever.",
            "Actually he was this call. So.",
            "This morning call okay that's important yes. So I'll I'll make sure that we we like let everybody know when the document ORGANIZATION8 document is up to date with all the request. And it it should appear yes you writed it make sense to to have it also like separate outside of the ORGANIZATION8 document as a fixed thing in your email.",
            "Yeah thank you.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thanks and I'll then ask PERSON16 how far you've got, and I'll see that also in the ORGANIZATION8 doc. Yeah so thanks to all.",
            "Hi, so I'm going to share the screen. And we are all can go to. Can you can you see my screen? I can't think so. Can you hear me?",
            "Yes, you're back.",
            "Yes, I'm. Sorry. Hello again.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hello. It works.",
            "K.",
            "We can see the screen now.",
            "Yeah, so. First was the question from PERSON7, ASR fixed. So can you.",
            "Yeah so when we look to the logs that we got from meeting. The incremental ASR wasn't working as it was described by ORGANIZATION5. And the updates weren't looking different in the description by ORGANIZATION5. And the timestamps were missing, so there was no way for us to tell the difference between stable text and unstable text. So stable stable text would be never be revised on unstable text can be revised. But without the timestamps we can't tell this. Now I did some testing and spoke to PERSON5 about this and did some testing with the text client, and everything works fine but the text client. And PERSON5 wasn't really sure what the difference was and the setup so. Yeah.",
            "My own experiments with the ASR output including the incremental one, the timestamps are there.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "They are there, you should not be relying on the timestamps of the entire package. If I if you request unsegmented text you get the get that output and something called a token. And boundaries of the whole will just be with the first token and the end of the last token. On on the level of individual tokens. And sometimes the start and end times don't match exactly. So I had basically good success but. Doing the different matching it's just a. You receive a token again that overlaps the token you already have. Then that's where the resending starts, I suppose. And everything.",
            "See see I actually have some matches the text. In order to. Sorry.",
            "No. There are timestamps they are timestamps for each token.",
            "Okay it's just we didn't get them in the WG session.",
            "You usually have to you you have to modify the client output them. They are in the packages.",
            "Right, but they weren't there in the in the and the the. It wasn't just the timestamps were missing it was the updates I mean we looked at the logs and the updates. Did not work as. As described, they I I think I've I can't remember the details I mean I wrote an email about it. And then we looked to them, the text client everything were absolutely fine as described. That's, you its. So. So I was a bit confused.",
            "As a worker you can request the same language that is spoken by this text and you will get with the segmentation. So the punctuation with the capitalization and and with the protocol with the text client. And yes.",
            "About they way. I think we are requesting text yeah cuz I don't think we don't really want unsegmented text.",
            "If you are requesting text then there is absolutely no difference with the.",
            "Okay, but it was different. I mean we looked to the logs and it was different so that was that was the question, I don't read the. We cant really explain the difference. Cuz we haven't had a dry run since then we don't really know how to how to debug this.",
            "You can you can always the client and just send an audio file.",
            "Yeah but that works that works fine. It did not work in the dry run. That that was the puzzle.",
            "Really be no difference then.",
            "Yeah but there is a difference.",
            "There is not difference for the client between audio file and receiving stream.",
            "Yeah, its not there is this one thing that I haven't fully investigated. There's and argument that you can supply to the text client think something like ORGANIZATION7 and like that.",
            "There is a real time mode and if you send I would recommend you that you use that.",
            "Real time mode doesn't work.",
            "And and that that the ASR workers don't like that. With the real time mode though, the client will send the audio file one second per second.",
            "So which mode in the dry run?",
            "In the dry run it would be live audio so obviously real time.",
            "Yeah so maybe its the maybe there's a problem with the real time mode. Ok yeah. I I I don't. Yeah.",
            "One important thing is that I I use two clients, one for one instance of the client, can you hear me?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "One process was was audio client and here is unsegmented text. And another client or anot and and it sent it through pipe. To text client and it didn't send any any timestamps to second client. So the timestamp.",
            "Use case. I cannot use that. If you want translated text then request translator text.",
            "Yes of course, but but we don't use audio into translated text. But but audio into unsegmented text and another another client worker for unsegmented to segmented.",
            "Why.",
            "Why? Because this was, this way we don't need so many ASR workers. We need translations into many languages at once and we used only one.",
            "Multiple fingerprints with the client and multiple output fingerprints, you can you can do that without running multiple clients.",
            "But it didn't work. For for us. It was.",
            "Modify the client and add it that code but you supply one and you can request English, German, French, Italian, Spanish. All at once and you will receive all of those messages.",
            "This setup employs several ASR workers at at once even they were identical. So we. I checked it on I we tried this and it used many ASR workers so we switched. Can you hear me am I there? Some network connection error. Really? Confused. So PERSON10 I think that if if you need fingerprints in MT you should you should measure the times when you receive the messages. And they will match or is why you get the fingerprints right now.",
            "So we have to on timestamps.",
            "Yes.",
            "And and I'm not really sure how that's gonna work. But. But the problem is we need. Because I mean when I I run the text client its really clear from the logs you know I can see the ASR output coming in. And when the timestamp code written that can detect I can tell a difference between stable and unstable text. If I look at the logs from the WG I can tell very strange things happening, I'm trying to find an email that I wrote. Yeah. The text the text updates have non monotonic start time. So sometime the start time decreases. I'm not, well this I can tell from looking at the text, cuz we have no timestamps. But you know sometimes it, its sort of transmits yeah, and this is not a specified. So it transmits and then the next update might sort of roll back the start and translates. Transmits some earlier text. But I don't see this in the text client I just see this in the logs from the session. I don't really know we weren't monitoring detail what was going on in the session I dunno. But I was just. Maybe we just look and see what happens this time. Maybe its I'm not really sure.",
            "Yes. So new meeting, its important for PERSON4. So monitor of all sound channels, the monitor is there but its only on the laptop which is sending the audio, do you think its important for everyone? To have access to to the incoming audio? To and everyone who is abroad. Who is remotely. Remote.",
            "You mean you meant live monitoring or or just recording.",
            "Any comments? If not then then we edit to the list with with very low priority. Cuz obviously could be interesting but not very important, cuz sometimes I I. I inputted different language than expected so. So there was German ASR with with Czech speech. So obviously it was very very bad subtitles. Yeah, so another point. Can we somehow in the platform. Web browser to su, there is simply so many updates. So there is some long discussion.",
            "I mean one thing yeah I think. The presentation layer isn't isn't ideal sort of refreshes subtitles and so on. Its a bit difficult to describe but can we capture some video of the presentation layer? So that we can actually kind of. You know replay it as an actually you know cuz we, I think people have written down. What happened to the presentation layer as they were watching it. Slightly different memories. What to be mean. If we just had to capture screen grab video, not the whole thing. The whole thing just isn't really necessary, but for some part of that I think it might be easier to to discuss afterwards.",
            "Yes there is. Yeah. I think we can manage it if we have.",
            "Then it should be possible to capture it and archive it. Will do it.",
            "Someway to figure out. Things look like, I dunno if it screen grab.",
            "Yes this is the so we need just to don't forget to run it. It should be pretty simple. So so solid. ASR models. Okay. I think this is clear but who is going to work on it. We would we have many or maybe PERSON18. Ask him. How far is the, is the test set. ASR quality simple you shows. People are disturbing are always up to or subtitling. Disturbance. So any wrong word is critical. Any other comment and yes. Lets move. They wants record to the ASR to the avoid it. We need somehow handle it. Any ideas or anyone who working working on this. This is some particular. And otherwise we don't have anything. Final hypothesis. You seem to oscillate between hypothesis. Particular setting and processing to. Single pipeline. They queued. Setup correctly, the new updates should have priority.",
            "Yes, we we are working on that on a newer version the published worker. I cant promise you that it would be right before the for the next event, but you would like most likely be ready for the the.",
            "Have not seen this at all, but now it. Empty deliverance some output was number segment. Yes. So this is the. This should be, or maybe. One of the reason is that empty very long segment and there is not enough space into subtitle window so. First option to fix it which would be to change the subtitling window. Similar to lecture translator, so it there is very long text. And you see and they either can read the whole paragraph at once. Or second as.",
            "That its that is risky because the the presentation platform is not, you know. Is not enough display space to actually display a paragraph so we need to we are forced to to to to split I think. Currently we have two lines of text. We are set to display up to 42 characters per line right now. It is computable but we did some test. We run a test internally and that is usually you know, what is. Easily readable via DIR person. So, we are right now we are configure like that. We also. We have an experimental setup which just dumps everything everything that gets sent by, everything comes to the end of the pipeline. That appear to not to do it work was. So. We, okay, testing, okay lets say its very hard for us right now to replicate a situation that is just bad as I have been told it was during the event. So maybe.",
            "So do you need test test case to find.",
            "I, yes I think if the if there are recordings of the the audio from the event. May actually be useful to to replicate the the amount of of published text we should expect.",
            "Maybe we watch the presentation from PROJECT1 or do replay and watch. Watch the subtitles and when this appears and we and to a test case for it from it. And will be possible that there will be two options to show the subtitles, one will be similar to translator so on the screen they see see the history. Or of the speech and when they, they click on some button they see slides and and only one one line of text.",
            "Right now the the presentation platform you can select you can enable or disable individual languages and you may want to see or not see.",
            "Yes I know.",
            "But for for each language you select, for each language you enable you will see its own panel with its own text. And the amount of text depends on the configuration of the publisher for that language. We can we can theoretically configure the publisher for each language in its own way. But we cannot change it live, we would need to restart the whole worker. So all the instances. All the publishers. Together.",
            "I mean this this would be a brand new feature of of the publisher or it would need.",
            "Its not exactly new we have both alternative, one one well the oldest one which is the one set to 42characters per line. Is the one which ran during the the last event don't exactly remember when it was. But it was a two day event I remember on the second day we we switch to an experiment. And the I don't exactly recall what it was, but it seems to perform worse than the the. So we actually I think we use the for them. It ran in the morning of the second day, and then we switched back to the old one. We still have both implementations available.",
            "What was the difference?",
            "One lets say the old one attempts to feel. So if we if two short messages are are published in very quickly. They are they are so the first and then the second one they appear on the same line. But that, lets say it we had feedback immediate feedback that was very very unpleasant to read. So we si switched the the second implementation. Which just published each piece on its own. That was apparently too fast and we also got feedback on that. That was, just too fast to short messages to quick and they were. They were running so fast you cannot read them. But then at least it was, it was more responsive so. The other one that delays build up as the presentation run and so the delay increased increased increased until until the subtitles were.",
            "So maybe some of the, some of the comments about about this are on the on the on the new setup. Which you already sold by.",
            "I would call it sold actually, we. But we have not been able to replicate any of the okay, we have replicated the situation its not it has not appeared to be as worse as bad as it was described. So I think we still lacking some some information is missing because we cannot replicate such bad performances.",
            "Okay I mean we have some comments about and feedback maybe they reported to the situation experimental setup. Of of the mediator and there were many. The updates of the subtitles were very fast so they maybe maybe it was this experiment. Which was which was replaced back to this.",
            "The word were jumping too much. It would be nice if it was somehow possible that you would scroll by lines and not have the have a single word jump left and right and yeah. I found founded that I was using too much time looking at the place where I should be actually reading.",
            "Yeah, and do you remember which day was it? If it was second day then it was this experiment.",
            "No I think the second day would be scrolling too much, because the message and they would just. My problem was that the work was jumping left and right on the same line. When coming in.",
            "Okay.",
            "Oh think I remember. Yes okay this issues was we think it was due to partial hypothesis being combined in a line instead of a line. This was supposedly fixed by the segmentation worker I think I have not. Heard any update on that so I I thought that was fixed, maybe I'm wrong but.",
            "Okay. Real time display is critical in this interpreters respeakers to. Actually the interpreters told us that they have too many problems with catching interpreting and they don't have time to follow our our ASR.",
            "Our ASR which they do not want to follow subtitles. Maybe only they ask them to to do it. We ask them to interpret and you do not want to follow the subtitles understand the language speaker.",
            "I know there was one point when he said, it would be useful. And actually real interpreters, when one is interpreting the other one usually does this for the the one that this writing down numbers. So the do not have to remember that. Actually, the inactive interpreter writes down these numbers for the other one to, to read.",
            "Yes, but they but they the screen are correct so they have to understand follow on their own without our our tool. She perhaps only the last bit of deliverance translations to the presentation at once.",
            "I do not see why UDP would make this better I think. It could be handled higher level. What it means is the ones everything to be asynchronous I suppose.",
            "It is not. I assume that is from from, from. That is not technically feasible either.",
            "I know it is not it. Yea, it would require to do the architecture again.",
            "Take the first point that everything should be passed through as quickly as possible. Changing the underlying wire protocol is not going to make much difference I do not think.",
            "He should have chance to because sometimes people suddenly. Telling you which subtitles are you seeing. You can see several like windows presentation interface, and which. Sending any content and it disappears. Have to kill all of them.",
            "There is actually something else about this.",
            "Yes.",
            "Stop the client by pressing control c. I believe the signal is not being caught inside the client, which means the client never sends a done.",
            "Yeah I can confirm that.",
            "Yes that's not how it supposed to be is it.",
            "Yes.",
            "No its not. Its session should be closed properly so the the correct way to to shutdown session is to close. I dunno if the to accept to accept standard input, but if it is then control d would be the the way.",
            "Okay okay. Very good comment.",
            "The EB client does not read from standard input.",
            "No, they they.",
            "Oh it does. It shoul its not a big I don't think its that difficult I'm not a C programmer but I think its not that difficult to add in the the client signal by pressing control c and then properly.",
            "But they will be cases where the session is not shut down properly I mean.",
            "In normal case. Because I think the normal case is stopping, most people do it with control c, especially when they are sending an audio file.",
            "Okay, this week or very very soon we should review all all my scripts and I should check this. Because pipeline which tends and I pressed only one control c. And it it seemed to be stopped but later as I I saw some processes in background like.",
            "But doesn't the server notice that the socket is closed.",
            "It does but it takes quite long time to to shutdown to to cut there is a that monitors the activity. The value is computable if I correctly, I'm not sure, but its on a long timeout lets say. I wouldn't to to, yeah sorry.",
            "So it only notices that the socket is closed, because there is no no activity on it.",
            "Exactly yes.",
            "Okay yeah yes. Yeah.",
            "No we don't want to because. Especially well the architecture is was designed to conferences so. So I think quite a long silence from a speaker is a is actually expected from time to time. So it well, if we shorten that timeout it maybe.",
            "Okay. Czech ASR anyone here Czech ASR. Yeah I spoke with the interpreters and they said that what would have been but only the specific terms yeah. Which nowadays, but. Do interpreters want to not to see the whole, whole output but only some specific times. They said that they would have done far better if they had the presentations ahead most of the, then from the translating English Czech quite hard. But even the English was not that easy. Unprepared. So. To ASR. From the systems ASR is possible adaptation. Are you working on on some speaker adaptation ASR or.",
            "Not right now as far as I know. We used to have some some of that speaker adaptation but. End to end system. And I do have the ability hybrid system, language model adaptation. Names for. Could be recognized.",
            "So any and do you plan any. Wait. Do you plan any updates on on the quality of the ASR.",
            "Yes always.",
            "And there would be something until May until the congress.",
            "The congress is early next year.",
            "No its in May next year, or.",
            "PERSON11 has has had to. There are definitely. But don't know the example right here.",
            "Okay. So debugging all the subtitles until I shown output. Anyone knows what is chopper? Its its PERSON9's script which shops haven't.",
            "Repeated text.",
            "And sends shorter lines than. Instead of 150 it sends only 100 and the rest with the next message. Its. To find current update. Lets go for one. Yeah yeah. So we are back to incremental ASR what we did at the beginning. Yeah one one way of the timestamping is is that these the timestamps in in the text. And then when we need to make some protocol on the content from the timestamps.",
            "Seems like a bad idea. The bad idea I mean it the timestamps are coming we are getting timestamps into empty without having having to embed it to the text. Or anything like that. That is just strange. But truly there is a way to send a a I mean isn't there a way send timestamps in the protocol without actually just pasting them into the text.",
            "The timestamps.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Further up in the document. Yeah two timestamps two different timestamps into text. And there is a release called.",
            "Yeah,, stop off sad.",
            "Yes those are strings and I believe I think we make use of the.",
            "Okay, so I'm looking at the logs and the offsets are actually empty. The start and stop did have something in them but they were bogus.",
            "Yeah but there there is the quite strange. Timestamps, I know we we use them and we use them somehow but its.",
            "To PERSON16 yes is there is in this that's transmitted down the between components there is a slot for the timestamp. So we shouldn't embed it with the text.",
            "Yeah ideally there there is definitely some meta information in the packages which is not should go into the text. The text text from the segment.",
            "Exactly, yeah. I think the empty probably isn't sending all the timestamps I have to check that.",
            "I would be surprised if that was the case.",
            "I think it is I think its just.",
            "Oh okay right. Stand correct.",
            "Or. Where we can bypass. The timestamps are necessary or they come from ASR and they are necessary only in presentation, aren't they?",
            "Yeah I think they're necessary components to know when you know you see two sections of the text with the same timestamp but you know that the ASR is updated as output. Yeah. And I think you do want. You do want the actual timestamps you don't want other components having their own timestamps I don't.",
            "As far as I can tell from looking at the, we should be populating all of the timestamps fields. If you are requesting the text output. Not. I would have to look at the output from the client again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To make sure. I mean I think the the the the output of the client as it is I think its not that useful, it does show you usually zeros or empty fields or a stuff like that. Because its not looking at the correct fields for the.",
            "But no actually it not even designed to correct to propagate data, its just make a.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just it was meant just to to see if stuff was was getting back. Well I'm not the right now but I I remember packages are sent back to the client then its up to the the client to the same. EB client selects just the text content from the the token messages I think.",
            "Other information as well, however that information is not usually populated in the packages and so its actually always going to be I think its always a zero and one. And no matter what actually back.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But its its a small modification to make this work.",
            "Yeah. Okay, can you repeat it or write write here into summary I didn't hear you now.",
            "I don't know if we need those options. Because an option exists even using right now which is use the mediator protocol. We put the timestamps in the fields in the packages for the mediator where they should go.",
            "Yeah but it has to draw back that then we don't have access to immediate result. And empty and so on and we don't know which component.",
            "You always the immediate results if you request them in the client, you can request. If the same client and the same connector requests anything you will not get double connection. For example if if your client is English audio and it request unsegmented text. An English segmented text and German text. Requested only once, even. All the.",
            "Lets try to any and if its not necessary then I will go for this. This is. Question was that the ASR than the English one despite this just a first it has most likely that like English was spoken exclusively by non native speakers. As a consortium we should collectively create a reasonable big non native English speech outputs. Select some interesting English documents and have. Possible. For extremely long German sentences. For user should be wasted. So this is comment on the. The size of content that is displays to the user. That we solved for. So PERSON10 this is what the timestamp look like in the.",
            "This is what we had from dry run and they they they're following a very regular.",
            "Yes, which what client are you using, what is your input.",
            "It will be it will be the segmented text yeah.",
            "So you are inputting text?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes the inputting the text client is not supplying.",
            "This isn't this isn't from the text client, this is from the MT client.",
            "Yes, I think I think.",
            "There is no empty there is an empty worker. The client. Translation, what is your input, is it text or is it audio.",
            "I don't think it can be audio.",
            "Because this definitely is the text I remember the text client just has these bogus offsets because the text information has no time. There is no there is no sensible of.",
            "Okay, how do we get it then. Because so it EB client it works fine.",
            "EB client.",
            "Sorry?",
            "EB client transmitting audio, I can show you my log output, looks more.",
            "If I may EB client only accepts audio as as input.",
            "Yes and then then we have also text client which accepts text. But I think.",
            "We lose the timestamps from the ASR. Because when we got a text the timestamps are gone.",
            "Yeah but we should we should fix this.",
            "Yeah. I think we need them in order to know when when the text is being updated, when its transmitting from unstable to stable, otherwise we have to resort. Tryna match all the text and that's gonna be.",
            "Question if this timestamps for the text client are set in the sensible way why are you even getting partial translation.",
            "I I don't know. We just get what we get.",
            "Very much.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON9 did some distinguishing of of partial, not partial hypothesis in his chapter. And he did only on the.",
            "Yeah I mean, that that is kind of doable but the point is that this information is available, the ASR. I mean when I use the EB client I can get this information so when I'm using the the system. That we have set up for the dry run, the information is being lost. So it just be useful if the information could be retrieved.",
            "Information okay, so if you use the text client there never is any time information to begin with. There is nothing being lost because there never was anything.",
            "I don't really understand because there was audio so audio.",
            "The text client sends on line at the time and each time you see this will automatically increase the offset by one second and have one millisecond.",
            "Okay, so I'm talking about using using E using EB client where I send audio into the system and I get text out. Yeah so you are telling that's an audio client is it.",
            "Yes, my my log output that I posted the is an audio client and.",
            "So how do I know I've got an audio client to text client.",
            "Yes there is an audio yes.",
            "So what is the which oh the empty is neither its the worker.",
            "The empty is a worker yes.",
            "Okay, but it gets some input from somewhere.",
            "It does get input from somewhere but it does not attach timing information, it just pass the.",
            "I know I don't want it to attach the timing information but I would like it get the timing information from ASR.",
            "It does. You can see in my log output the timing information is there. If a time information is coming from actual audio which does have time information. It is passed through the the pipeline.",
            "So your log is from your empty worker is it?",
            "No this is from the client. I did did modify so it prints the correct fields and the packages.",
            "Yeah yeah. I've done that as well with the client and that works fine. What I don't understand is why the empty worker cannot access this information.",
            "I mean it really can.",
            "Okay, well that.",
            "Yeah, thats what we don't really understand, when it stop offsets, there these bogus ones.",
            "If I may, could it be this due to the the chopper?",
            "After the MT.",
            "No I think it it is before, because the ASR the, it is because the type matching in the fingerprints correctly I think. Okay we have some ASR set that produce text and some they unseg text. But but the empty workers they want text right.",
            "Right.",
            "Some some paths have to pass through a chopper which preserves the, which does not translate but the converts the type of the fingerprint between unseg and text. And that may lose the time information.",
            "Okay maybe yeah maybe that's why I got this weird ASR output.",
            "I I.",
            "The the the drawback or. I don't know the chopper was in between the ASR and the MT.",
            "This is this is due to the path selection so it has to be the because otherwise the the translator worker could not accept the.",
            "Chopper is something completely different. The chopper is something that that. That PERSON9 wrote that has to do with the subtitled presentation. There is a component in between ASR and MT we call it the segmenter.",
            "Yeah yeah, and that's fine.",
            "I just want to make sure that we use the same terms so that you will not be.",
            "Oh yeah, the segmenter is is doing what I expected to do as far as I can say.",
            "Yes, my output that I posted also has used the segmenter.",
            "Yeah; yeah I mean I can run EB client and I can get this output, what I don't understand and maybe we have to look at our code and maybe try and figure out what's going. Is why we don't get this from MT.",
            "Oh there are. Okay, so two things. You don't get a I'm almost output that you post is it is the from your worker is that correct?",
            "Yeah, yeah well it is this is, sorry PERSON11 can explain.",
            "The worker can print the time information as it find it in the packages. The packages which are really constructed by the client was sending the input and. If this is the text client it will send these strange offsets. And your worker is in the timing information, that does it never was.",
            "Yes so I'm completely okay I fundamentally don't understand the architecture so, I don't understand, to me.",
            "The time offset.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Time offset is not. The package was sent. It is a time that is just written into the package time information. This offset is supposed to be number of milliseconds.",
            "Yeah. Right. But I don't understand why we cant get it from the audio.",
            "That I'm not sure about. I mean the the client the normally EB client.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "This log output I just made now is EB client.",
            "Yeah no, that's good and I I see that as well with EB client but I don't understand why don't see with MT.",
            "Yes, okay. Even if you use your empty workers with EB client you still get this output.",
            "But, sorry I'm not that's why I said the architecture. Because I don't really know. So so in the dry run setup right, there's audio, yeah. Which comes from the speaker. The audio goes through ASR then goes through.",
            "To the client.",
            "The audio, the audio for goes to a client who who attach this timing information so, if the client sends one second of audio there would be a start and the stop.",
            "So the audio goes through the client the audio goes through the client first, and then then where does it go.",
            "Then it goes to the ASR which is, then have a timing information which is.",
            "Its the correct timing information is milliseconds since the start of the each whatever. RIght, and then this audio so this and the text comes out of the ASR and it somehow has timing information which relays to the time of the actual audio. Then it goes to the normalization.",
            "Yes the the ASR recognizers work someway in this in this audio and will have the timing information for each word.",
            "Right, so then it goes to the normalization. It goes to the normalization and that preserves this this time set. And then it goes to MT this time it has gone.",
            "It should I mean.",
            "Right so that's, so that is the mystery.",
            "I I well I have an hypothesis if I'm looking at this this pipeline written right here. So, if the if the text is actually dunked back on the client so it goes it goes to the architecture and comes down. Until it is in the architecture the the streaming is, the strea the the pipeline is composed of a serious of a messages, right? And also. But I my guess is that the text client outputs just a plain text. So that in that point, the all the others are lost I think. Because then it should. I think, no. It would then.",
            "Between ASR. Component between ASR, there's ASR normalization and then the some other and then sending it onto MT.",
            "No, no no no no no no. This component does not strip of any headers, that would that would completely destroy the whole pipeline, it does not do that.",
            "Hum, stripping of some headers.",
            "But but the component is not part of the pipeline, there are actually two pipelines. And its in between them there is the client but the these text client its outside of the architecture, right?",
            "The text client is is a client its a beginning and end of the pipeline.",
            "How can a text client end.",
            "Because in both and receives the final output. So its.",
            "So it sends in the audio and then.",
            "Not not the text client.",
            "Okay. Right, in the PROJECT1 live demo which client is sending the audio.",
            "EB client should be.",
            "EB client is sending the audio and the audio goes to ASR it goes to normalization so it goes to ASR it comes out of the ASR as text but it still has the timestamps then it goes to normalization and then it goes to MT but which time no longer has the timestamps.",
            "And I'm I'm saying this is this cannot be this cannot be correct that it does not have the timestamps because our MT workers are using these timestamps.",
            "Okay okay I get I get I get that.",
            "But I'm saying that. The time in your log output are because the timing information does not come from any audio information any audio timing but artificial.",
            "Yeah okay but I don't understand why who is where are these timestamps being removed the good timestamps that we want the ones that come from the audio. Are being replaced by these bogus timestamps, where is that happening.",
            "In the log output that you are showing outputs because there has never been any audio input.",
            "Wait there is audio. There is audio.",
            "Are you sure.",
            "Yeah cuz these logs are from the live the dry run.",
            "But we were using it during the dry run was working. I I very. Timestamps like this.",
            "I mean its quite possible that we are doing something wrong but I don't know how looking for it.",
            "Maybe it wasn't implemented or, we were lucky that we we. But we drop the timestamps at some point.",
            "All models would be completely going crazy timestamps again. But I mean I really cannot say what happened in that log file I guess. Maybe some implementation changed maybe someone.",
            "I appreciate that yeah.",
            "If you are on the client right now and and show look at the log output there, then then we can talk about because we know what the implementation.",
            "Okay that's what I've been doing in that works during the dry run.",
            "I see.",
            "So something maybe changed, but I'm not sure what.",
            "Maybe changed.",
            "Maybe we were testing at some point the text client also during the dry run and we check from different section in the dry run maybe there's a different time.",
            "So I think in the first day of the dry run this started offset and miss lets see, the start offset and the stop offset were missing.",
            "There was no coding. I added that of the first day.",
            "Right they were not logged. But this this strange pattern in this start and stop time was there. All the way through.",
            "The reason why I'm so I'm so sure that its the text going with PERSON1 through the text client and making this specific putting in specific pattern. Because otherwise the if the timestamps aren't it causes other problems.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "1000 milliseconds and then 1 millisecond.",
            "From the text client. But we don't really know why because there was definitely audio system.",
            "Some later portion of the logs maybe.",
            "That is the end of the logs.",
            "Then maybe some earlier section.",
            "Its the same.",
            "Maybe it might be related to this multiple clients that PERSON2 was talking about. If if I'm you have EB client and then you feed it again into text client so. If if you at some point feed your input into the text client then yes you are losing the timing information, you just rely on the normal pipeline from from the mediator. Requesting multiple output thing. I I think I understand okay I think I'm beginning to understand yes, I understand the thing you wrote at the bottom. The EB client only runs the ASR. And still has audio information then its pipe again so starting another pipeline.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Timing information.",
            "Right right that makes sense.",
            "This cannot work, this pipeline cannot produce useful results. If you want multiple. If it is not working right now than we need to figure out how it can work, but run. Request a.",
            "In principle we can, it is possible to specify output requests sorry, input requests, because it is it is upside down.",
            "Right now but, definitely.",
            "Yes, it is yes, we may have a different sample.",
            "I definitely understand how how. Could be that was wrong time information as I see it,.",
            "That is that is what I was asking was or between our MTN ASR. There was something there.",
            "Yeah. We can make it work all in a single pipeline, but it. Well, Yeah. Well, in principle for client you should be able to request, multiple, request,, and I do not remember you can have you declare one output, which is the audio you are providing, and then you, you can request multiple inputs streams, which is what you expect back from the architecture, and you can specify a different fingerprints and types of for each of them so. In principal if we, if we build ok. And if we can assume we had on workers to match to create the path. We could attach one session of client. Providing input, in one language, to a serious to a text, in a single pipe.",
            "They realize that they are also workers right?",
            "The publisher workers. We are using, you know, the the third, the part of the fingerprint which, the first is the count in the not the language than the county. Then you have, specifier, which, is orbitary, we use whatever languages is this minus Bob no and then. It may require I am not sure about that but it also requires, you know, harder in the client, which is not the case right now but then. This, this would require a whole piper, in the mediator must be able to provide this channel. So we still need. We still need to address the issue between the and text on, our in our all our segment is working, right now, or on some of them scripts?",
            "No the are all workers. Ok. So this should work in principle.",
            "Yes I think so. The only difference is that was that the proper presentation platform needs to be implemented as part of the presentation platform because it cannot be run of the separate script somewhere. In my opinion with the dropper is an aspect of the presentation anyway. Yes.",
            "Fingerprint, which think in some point is that using.",
            "It could be a worker and be and be pipe inside.",
            "You are probably right is actually part of the presentation. It is just. It is the choice of how to present that they presented the.",
            "Yes. If this is because, but I I'm thinking about he could be that all the all the. We with,,, multiple hypotheses, and such. It may disappear. Once the machine translation that like the translations workers are getting the proper at times input.",
            "And yeah, well, what we would be able to think about what strategy sues the downstream components of the moment, we just translate everything, because we can't do anything else.",
            "Right.",
            "So it would just disappear. And we have to do something.",
            "Yes, but having better input will will do better translations right. Yeah, and then we can. I mean, that was why I opened this whole thing up, because I thought, how can we we decide what to translate.",
            "Right. At the moment we can not because we do not have well, in the in the dry run, and we did not have the correct time-stamps. When I run the using the client. I can get the correct time-stamps. So that, yeah.",
            "We do not have access to these locks. I like this pipeline more because.",
            "You got these intermediate logs.",
            "Yes, it is much better.",
            "For example, in the in the command the German. Which is only only. But you also get the English translation and the German translation. You get all of this. I think the issue is we are losing the intermediate steps.",
            "No immediate fingerprints, if you want them.",
            "And yes, we can have immediate fingerprints um-hum. OK. So we are trying. But I have to check if this ASR workers as they are the outputs.",
            "So what is this minus I and minus F?",
            "Request in the in the in fingerprint. It is it is a bit confusing because for the client.",
            "I read, this is initial and final round.",
            "Yes."

            "Hello, hi. So I just talked to PERSON3, and he was not of the call, and he will join us in about fifteen minutes. So.",
            "Ok.",
            "I think its important that, that, he also confirms what what we will be presenting a the what what is what would be the technical.",
            "Of course, we can wait for PERSON3. No problem.",
            "Or we could or we could start with the, the technical things that are not the important for, for him, so.",
            "Okay, just give me a second.",
            "PERSON2 or PERSON10?",
            "Yep, exactly.",
            "So lets wait. Lets wait.",
            "I just going to check if PERSON2 will join us or not because actually he is on another call.",
            "Oh so and does the pexip link work? Like I heard your, complained about the number of participants. Hello. Thats not doing anything. It is.",
            "No, unfortunately, PERSON2 will not join us.",
            "Ok.",
            "I'm sorry. I will try to do my best, in answering your technical questions regarding the architecture of the audio service. Which, is that absolutely not my scope.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON10, and PERSON10? We are still waiting for PERSON10 right?",
            "No PERSON10 will not join the meeting. I will report him the the outcome. Yep.",
            "Okay and I also don't expect PERSON6 the the head of the the boss of PERSON3 to to join. So, well. I dunno how to start. There are too many things. I think that we should, yes. So, one thing is that, have you ever worked with, with the subtitling sorry, with with the capturing the video from machine like video mixer, the device that ORGANIZATION7 has recommended us Epifun. So so are are you by the way are you looking PROJECT2 PROJECT1 document?",
            "Yep, but unfortunately I have no experience with with the video mixer sorry. But we can together of course.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah. So so actually maybe I'll I'll start sharing my screen and another thing is that that this session is hopefully being recorded. I hope you do not.",
            "Yes, no no no problem.",
            "Just screen, so that you know exactly where I am looking at. So this Epifun, thats a device that you connect to the video output of whatever presentation computer, and it will. And then you connect, the other end to USB. And it works as the webcam for the for the like video, mixing notebook. So what you get is is fake webcam. And this webcam sees, what is on the screen of the main presentation system.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I have worked with that we have tested. We bought one the price was about 300 euros. I think or maybe. Yeah. Something like that, maybe more, and maybe 400 euros, and then, its. It works. Technically it works. If you can accept both VGA and HDMI. The webcam size is like does not always match the rectangle of the of the screen. But somehow it is all there. But the compression seems sometimes a bit too aggressive. So it distortes a little the image of the of that screen.",
            "Ok. You plan to use these kind of solution to cast these lights. Let say.",
            "So this is a that is that is something that we need to discuss.",
            "Okay.",
            "This is the easiest to set up so big. This is the easiest to attach to anyone's machine. So whoever will be presenting. We could simply plug this in and steal the image, and then do the video mixing, and all that. If we are. So this is something for for PERSON3, also to check, and I will invite him for for that. But there is a slight risk that. ORGANIZATION3 will say that the distortion of the screen is is too bad. And we don't want this.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "And then, so.",
            "Oh what happened.",
            "Yeah sorry I'm. Hello, does it work again?",
            "Yes.",
            "So sorry for some reason it just died.",
            "Thats not a problem.",
            "Yeah, it is a problem. I don't like. So what have you still heard.",
            "We arrived at ORGANIZATION3 sees that Epifun solution is not good due to quality of the image.",
            "Well ORGANIZATION3, well ORGANIZATION3 has not saved said that yet. So it is possible. So its only if ORGANIZATION3 says, so maybe they will say, I'm just working on this in the case if they don't like it. Yeah. And then the question is, can we duplicate the duplicate video signals somehow. So HDMI from presentation notebook to overhead projector. So no subtitles. Mixed in. And at the same time. Yep, sorry. And at the same time to be Epifun. Would you? Would you know how to do this?",
            "Well, actually, if we say that there is no requirement on having the subtitles on the main stage. We can run Epifun in order to cast those lights. And use the the usual, the desktop sharing to cast the slides on the main stage for example.",
            "But then the video quality is already bad, because it go through Epifun. Thats what I'm saying. So as soon. So.",
            "You say that. Okay.",
            "Yeah I'm I'm my my worry is that whenever we do anything with the video signal from the presentation machine to the overhead projector. We will decrease the quality. So I think we should go only directly to the overhead a projector.",
            "How bad be the, please.",
            "Yeah. At the at the same time we we need to steal the image. So the question is how to, produce a video from a from random computer, a presentation notebook or whatever directly to the overhead screen, the projector. And at the same time to steal it. For, for the streaming.",
            "Well, actually, it and probably could be done in the video mixer. But I I'm not an expert about the mixers so. Audio and video.",
            "Video mixer, we actually always meant only the Epifun and a notebook. So the the the Epifun is stealing the image but its not creating any copy of that any further. It is they are actually putting it to USB and the webcams signal. And then.",
            "Let me check what Epifun is.",
            "Well, I'll I'll. Thats a company. Paste the link. We have the link probably already. But. So this is, this is the this is the link.",
            "Okay, got you.",
            "Yeah. It says. And it probably is. But the problem is that Full HD is still too bad for like compared to the direct presentation.",
            "Well, actually its says that it cast high definition videos. And we have to cast slight than how bad could became an image.",
            "Yeah, it is. Well so I'll okay, so lets lets leave this question for later on for PERSON3.",
            "Of course I will check it with PERSON2 which is much more experienced than me on this kind of things. Okay, we check it.",
            "Yeah so the question for the PERSON2 would be this. Can we duplicate video signal somehow so that it would go to the overhead projector uninterrupted and at the same time to Epifun, so we would only get a copy.",
            "Yep. Probably two different Epifun an external a video card.",
            "No, it is, well, yes or no it depends. But its Epifun is invisible to the presentation notebook, so from where you are presenting the slides or you could be playing YouTube videos or whatever. Epifun is invisible to that. Epifun is is sits where the overhead would normally be, but instead of beeming it to the wall it sends it through USB as a webcam signal to another machine. And there in the another machine you can do with this webcam video whatever you like. You can show it live on the screen, and then you can like further project it with an overhead projector or you can also do the streaming thats for whoever is else is watching. So the I think for the streaming the quality is good. It is definitely ok, we cannot expect to pass more through the network, a, but for the overhead projection. It is little bit distorted. It simply it is. So the question is how to how to do the like duplicate the signal so that we get it separately to the overhead projector. And to Epifun without Epifun interfering in this presentation. So thats the, the simple question.",
            "Okay, I took the notes and I hope we can back with some answer.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. So we, I still don't have. I see don't see PERSON3 here in the call. Oh, hello PERSON3, are you here. We can see you but we don't hear you. So PERSON3 is there with instances.",
            "Yep.",
            "So. So before PERSON3 solves the sound issues. Then we can discuss the other thing. And thats the streaming of the slides. Have you had chance to look at the simple solution.",
            "No.",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "No unfortunately no, but we will do it absolutely. And we I want to check the you mentioned in the last meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, we will check it.",
            "Yeah, so. I have no experience with HTML stream viewers. So it would be very good. I'll now highlight this again with word. So I'm I'm for the download on the Google Doc. I think that that sharing the screen killed my machine. So I wont do that.",
            "Okay, no problem.",
            "Yeah. So I've highlighted now involved this. The thing about stream viewers. So your presentation platform, will be presented from a web browser right?",
            "Yep. So it could be used also on personal devices and also presenting full screen lets say on the main stage, which was one of the the requirements.",
            "Yes, that is that is very good think it is also the the, like the the most flexible solution for for the future. I'm, but we need to have the video player for the slides portable. And I have no experience with this. So if you could along with checking for the latency issue in this repository in this one that I highlighted now. If you could if you could also paste or like a push a file an HTML file, which will would does demo of of the streaming. So just empty page with one video player in there that place a realtime video from the RTM protocol. This would be very useful so that I could also like test it on my side, and and see how that.",
            "Yeah, ok. We, can do it, of course. I cannot promise you when. We will do it, but we can provide you some kind of raw example.",
            "Yeah. This this presentation of of the stream is an important part for the participants if we are able to stream the slides. We need the participants to be able to see them. So it. It should be ready by the end of June as well. And the sooner you had the sooner you send me some useful HTML code the sooner I can test it on my side. Because yeah. So there is still one option, and that would be direct screen grabbing. So we could live without Epifun. If the presentation notebook is the same as the video streaming notebook. So if you were like presenting the slides from the same machine that will do the streaming,? Then this machine would be doing standard like stream screen casting. So it would be presenting sending the, its screen. To the, the the the the read read particle server. And then,, the the same machine would be presenting the video signals to the overhead projector uninterrupted with no Epifun in between. And then the same machine would be sending this stream of of office the screen to everybody. And with this setup, we would not have the problem of of the decreased quality. I'm, we would have to.",
            "If I correctly understood this second scenario could be the one where the on the presentation laptop we read the vid slides directly from the. Yep, exactly. And then we capture the screen and we cast it.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay. Oh it sounds a little bit more tricky for me but something we can reason about it of course.",
            "Well, I dunno. I ca I could do this in Linux. So my my exam code, on this subtitling prototype streaming in this repositary. That already shows how to grab the screen and send it. So I can. I can run the the web server for this live streaming on Linux machine, and it will emmit its screen as screencast. So this this work for me but ORGANIZATION3 may not like to present their presentations from Linux laptop. So thats my worry again. So they would have to convert the the presentations to something that is viewable correctly on Linux. Which is PDF's, but they don't normally work with PDF's. So I dunno know if they would accept that, and then the machine has to be strong enough to present the slides comfortably, and and stream the the the screen, which should be doable. So I think this is this is like, technically the preferred option, because it has the fewest components. It is single system single machine and it it does directly the screaming the Epifun is not involved. So that that look good. It also in principle, offers the option to mix in the subtitles with some on screen displays. So there is a library for Linux, that can write subtitles directly on the screen. I have not played played with this. Like recently, about I've done that some years ago,, for just when when I wanted a some notifications. So, so it was from simple scripts. I like pasted notifications that appeared on my screen. So I think it. It could be doable. In that case, the, the presentation client would have to be different. So it would be not. Not HTML thing. But it would be something which grabs the subtitles from a particle plays, and then the presents them with this on screen display. So I don't expect that you would like to implement this. But we could do it. So there is a number of the conditions that have to be met for the solutions to to be to be the chosen one. One of this is that ORGANIZATION3 is happy with that. The other one is that we are able like setup the streaming in that it works. And optionally that we are able to develop a client that reads the subtitles and present them on screen. So thats to me. This would be the cleanest solution. Yeah. Lets see. The the the the set up that you have for. The city of Rome,, that is being presented with an overhead projector or only stream over the web. I saw a demo.",
            "You see the live subtitling service in the. Actually it is performed by the the the audio video service of the rooms. There is some mixer who performs the streaming I can check with our technician of course. So in order to understand that little bit more, how the streaming is performed. But its performed by another company.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "The audio service one.",
            "Yeah and it is visible in the setup that I saw. So I saw someone presenting, and the like talking of the the use of city council of the city of Rome, and there were subtitles next to the the the person in some Greyish, with a little grey background, and I assumed that this video is available only over the Internet, and it is never displayed on any screens in the rooms themselves, or is it? Is it like the projected, no?.",
            "No, no. Its only casted.",
            "Yeah, okay. So then if we if we were the only casting. Then we would be of the same quality level that Epifun is good for. But we need the the the slides, so thats different. So we still don't have PERSON3 on the call, is that possible. So disconnected disconnected. So I'm available now. Okay. So can you talk PERSON3? We don't hear you PERSON3. Okay. Yes, so one thing that I really need to review. What I have not reviewed is the document that you wrote. And PERSON3 is surely not seen it either. So maybe if you could quickly through the document with us once PERSON3 is there.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "That would be the best option. So if if sreen sharing works for you.",
            "I will try, yes. Okay.",
            "So where is PERSON3. Is he is he online. I can hear you but okay. Okay. PERSON9 will present and you need to type fast, and before before PERSON9 so PERSON3 is here. So I'll quickly talk about the begging of the ORGANIZATION4 document and then PERSON9 will present the the details. So the hardware setup is that there are some self-presentation computer that goes to video mixer, and the video mixers Epifun. So I should say. So HDMI or VGA. To video grabber we have one then this goes to PROJECT2 video mixing notebook. And that goes to via ethernet to all the participants as a stream and. The video output of this notebook to the main screen. Discussed PERSON3 need to come to PERSON4 or vice versa. And we need to test Epifun with the overhead projector. And real slides, so that ORGANIZATION3 confirms the video quality. And there is, yeah, so this is the. So here is the the question to PERSON2 for for the for the like for the case if the quality of the video grabbing is not sufficient and then. The option b which is here. Option b. ORGANIZATION3 presentation computer is directly the video mixing computer of PROJECT2. It is used for reading slides in their format PDF. Serving the or screen grabbing. Grabbing of its own screen, serving the stream of the screen to the ethernet and then presenting its screen to overhead projector. And then receiving subtitles and presenting them as OSD on screen. Display over the presentation so. Option b the benefits. Best quality of slides. Then need to implement, oh thats not a benefit. Drawbacks need to implement the subtitles to OSD and. Single machine no, Epifun needed. And another drawback is that Linux only PERSON4 cant imagine doing this in Windows although it is surely possible to but I don't have the programming experience for that. Yeah, so PERSON3 please confirm in writing that you will talk to me and that we will test if we can go for option a.",
            "Oh yeah, it works, great.",
            "Finally, but unfortunately things you said.",
            "Oh okay, so there is two options in short. We, need to meet. And we need to test the video grabbing from your presentation machine. And presenting it also to your overhead projector, and you will confirm whether the quality of the slides is sufficient. And if it is, then a perfect. We will go for something which is now called option A. And I hope this would be the case. The option B is that,, we would need to the the. We would need to do the presentation and mixing of the slides on the same machine,. And in that case, I think it would have to be Linux, machine. So the slides for the workshop would have to be in PDF or something that Linux can present well. It could also be html slides like ORGANIZATION4 slides. But it cannot be PowerPoint. Yeah so.",
            "Use some not work.",
            "Yes exactly. So thats the thats the limitation. And its why I call it option B. So lets hope for option A. And if this is if we go for the option A. Its ideal, because we can use the same. The same presentation platform that ORGANIZATION5 will develop for all our purposes. It will be for handheld devices. It would be for, the main presentation. And in in a full screen mode. It would be for the participants notebooks. So when can we meet? This is something that we need to discuss. So let me know one day when I can come to you. Probably I'll bring the video mixer, and you will need to have the overhead projector ready, and some presentation notebook as the test one. And some presentations and will present it in through the video grabber, and we will see how that works. Okay. So now, lets look at the. Yeah?",
            "Video.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'll stop my webcam. How do I stop that. Yeah. I stopped my webcam, so this should reduce the load. Oh. PERSON9? Are you still there? Yes. Your video is also stopped.",
            "Yes yes, I stopped too. I'm going to upload the document of the functional analysis. So we can have a look at it together.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok I stopped my video completely, I will see if it works. But yesterday yeah.",
            "Yeah, it works. Okay, so lets lets keep looking unitl PERSON9 uploads the the en analysis the functional analysis document. We can look at the PROJECT1 ORGANIZATION4 document. And there is the item overview of the presentation modes to be supported that PROJECT1. And this is mainly for PERSON3 to confirm. So a subtitles on the main screen. Are we expected to do them. I assume the answer is yes unless we.",
            "Yes, of course. Yes of course.",
            "I am not sure. I'm getting I think you want to try I think we are in different to it.",
            "Okay, yeah okay. So thats true. PROJECT2 wants to try it. ORGANIZATION3 is in different, I dunno how many. Or ORGANIZATION3 ORGANIZATION3. So we will try. Yeah, so the preffered solution is indeed, as we discussed the presentation platform has the full screen no waste mode, so that the exact same presentation platform can be used in people's web-browsers, and on the PROJECT2 video mixing notebook. And the fallback solution is this is hacking,, or possibly a,, yeah and fallback solutions C. And we have a fallback solution B, as well. Fallback solution B C above. Subtitles on each participants notebook. So is this expected or again ORGANIZATION3 is in different.",
            "Say it again.",
            "This is expected.",
            "This is expected, okay.",
            "On the notebooks in front.",
            "This is expected by ORGANIZATION3. I cant hear, so maybe please type into the ORGANIZATION4 Document what exactly is expected. Is it or I'll have it every participant, yeah. Every participant is free to choose. The, the language. They like right? Should they see more? Should is should be allowed to see more languages.",
            "Yeah sure, why not?",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Its after them which language works for them the best,",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry just a question. Able to see more than one language subtitle at the same time?",
            "Yes, I assume.",
            "Okay. I'm asking if the participant is free to choose the language and one or more than one. And when more than one language is selected. More than one subtitle is displayed. Okay. PERSON3?",
            "PERSON4 to decide how he wants it. Participants should definitely be able to. Because language for them. But regarding the multiple languages I dunno will it be usable with slides in the background.",
            "No it in my opinion no. But I was asking in order to check it of course.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I was thinking about the lecture translator. I'm sure you know the interface. PERSON9.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. I think that it can be very useful for the participants to follow both.",
            "Oh, okay. Because the translation at some for the level of like confusion. So for this purpose. I think it would be useful to allow, two languages to choose up to two languages. So. So the screen layout would be like the top part would be the slides. And then the bottom part of would be either just one like bench, like like one bar off of the subtitles, or this same bar split into two with two subtitles in English. Well, again languages of of your choice. So so they could decide to follow French, and they mother tongue Polish or something like that.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "It could be useful for the for the participant. Following three of the languages is something which is probably not going to be useful for more people than me than myself and others. So I do not think that three languages would be necessary. And if you if it is hard for you. I think it is okay, to say that only one language has to be chosen.",
            "Well, actually its not the more hard, than displaying one language. But for me is actually I knew knew functional requirements, then probably it will not be ready for June, but for 2020 it could be done.",
            "Yeah, okay yes. So please take a note and please.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah yeah okay. So. Sorry. Yeah okay. One critical thing is this is no need to restart the session. It must be reconnect automatically, and that applies to all the components. So I'm highlighting this. Because I know from the the the fair where we tested the technology. That that we restarted the underlying client. So EB EB client and the the sessions and the worker pipeline. Many times during the day, and every time it created a new session ID. So every time we also had to change the, the, the presentation, we have to touch the presentation device. And first of all we do not want to like notify the participants that they need the restart that client. And and they need to like like I use a different ID somewhere. And second for the main screen. We, also don't want any restarts. We don't. We don't want to to have to go to that machine. We just want this machine to reconnect automatically whenever the underlying service is changed. So I hope that your setup allows this, so that there is like a symbolic name of the session, and that the main screen presentation as well as the participants connect to this symbolic name. And the underlying session ID's can be the totally like regenerated many times and it. It will gracefully jump from one another. To follow those sessions. Is that.",
            "OK probably, the presentation blocks way respects to the the these clients of the. It will be just lets see. Publishing platform. Then there will be something on the ORGANIZATION5 service architecture who will push subtitles to the presentation platform. In order to manage the. The. The case where a worker dissapear or there some problem. We have reasoned about it. And we choose to define a kind of queue of streams when a stream dissapear it start taking subtitles from a different stream. For example if we are going to display English subtitles, okay. Now we are going to display German subtitles translated from the English stream. And these pipe in at some point dissapears. Maybe we can display German subtitles translated from the interpreters. From the one who speaks lets say Russian Russian translated into German and display this stream. We have decided to manage it with kind of fullback queue lets say. These should should work. And it actually, its not that easy to manage it in order to also restart taking subtitles from the prefered stream when it comes back. Of course we.",
            "This was my question. So what if what if the main. Setup that we prefer the most becomes available again. How do we notify the overhead presentation platform to again.",
            "In the exact implementation we have not yet reasoned about it. But I expect that each stream for example has kind of indentification of the source. And preferd source. And we prefer always the first one lets say. When the first one comes back its it it start taking subtitles from the first one.",
            "I'mmediately starts taking subtitles from the first one.",
            "This is of course just still and idea. Not yet implemented. But could work in some sense this way.",
            "Yeah. There is actually two situations. One is that we want automatic and immediate fallback if something,, or especially if we like kill it kill the whole thing,, and and restart it. We want the presentation systems to pick it up again. But there is also the thing that we probably need to discuss later today, like during the call. And thats,, if there are on our side, more possible inputs. And we want to choose on the fly, which of them is the best, now. So thats like.",
            "Okay.",
            "Do we have that planned. Okay, yeah so thats not planned for the call today. But I had this idea that we would be recording,, the many the multiple English. So actually, we could have the floor English. And then two respeakers. And we, we need some way of looking at the outputs of ASR of each of those like looking at it without interrupting it. And then we need to select which one of them should be the source for the machine translation, and also, which should go to the to the main screen with the English subtitles. And this can change from speaker to speakers so to say, so.",
            "May I ask you? To go to, or or to check what assure on the. Okay. The second image for example. Six. This place whats what we call the configuration sorry. The configuration GUI. You are asking to have also. Lets say a box. On the right for example. For pair in order to have a preview of what is published as subtitles in order to perform.",
            "Visual check.",
            "Okay. Okay, okay. But this is done at presentation level. You are asking also to choose what to send to machine translation workers.",
            "Mm-hm. Yes.",
            "Ok but this is has to be done in a completely different place. Because presentation platforms just receives subtitles. And its not. It doesnt perform any regarding service architecture pipes. The pipes are controlled by the fingerprint mechanism.",
            "Yeah yeah. So for this please scroll down into ORGANIZATION4 document. There is a section called livestream selection.",
            "Okay.",
            "And this is where I outlined what I would like to have in the like the backstage,.",
            "Sorry. Livestream.",
            "Selection. It is on. It has an on the side it has a note assigned to you.",
            "Okay. Okay, I I found it.",
            "Yeah yeah excellent. Yeah. So if everything runs smoothly. We will have four or five possible inputs. ASR from the floor. ASR of respoken English. ASR of Czech. And ASR of German. This will has, this will have the a double the delay, because in the. Through Czech. So I would like to, to have a multilingual stream selection worker. This is what a this is what is needed. And you see from the in in in worker that indeed, it is not related to the presentation platform. Ideally, if we are able to set this up. It would be a simply user interface, that will work on the chosen sub set off ASR screens as they are rolling. It will show them and like preview, as we mentioned, and a human operator would be monitoring these outputs, blocking or allowing, each of them separately. So under each of the monitors screens the operator would could also manually enter. This is like really in the long term for the, for the 2020,. So they could enter of two kinds that gets simply erased from the stream. So it. It is already a worker on its own. It is its its changing what is in the stream. But also stop words that block the, entire stream until manually released again. So we can easily have come to situations where we a find speaker who mispronounce his something, and we get some horrible unexpected bad words. And for this case. We first we will try to just remove the stop words from the output. But if we see that is too common, to frequently pop pop. We would say okay, whenever this happens again. Just stop this input, don't consider it any further. And so this is this is something that we ideally would like to have. This is like an immediate response to some people's, miss pronunciations.",
            "Okay okay. Actually. You are talking about two different things probably. You are talking about lets say an application. Whos able to choose the ASR input for the machine translation. And you are talking about solution to to review. Lets say subtitles before publishing them. Its correct?",
            "No this is this is.",
            "Okay, sorry.",
            "Output of the ASR. If the ASR is then directly put to the subtitles. Then yes you are actually reviewing the subtitles, but you are right its good idea to separate this. Because we may want to do the same type of review also for the outputs of machine translation and not only for the ASR.",
            "Yes, and we put a kind of idea lets say a kind of requirement on the presentation platform regarding the possibility to review subtitles before publishing them. Ok, the these probably will be done for in the next year. But you say that.",
            "This is yeah yeah. I agree with you that is good to have this option as part of the presentation platform. But at the same time. It is important to have this option for reviewing the input for machine translation. Because if your ASR has some bad bad word. You don't want to kill it after all the target languages in in the the publishing platforms for the different target languages. You want to kill it at before the before the machine translation takes it. So this review has to happen after the ASR. And also possibly after the machine translation.",
            "Ok. This probably is a completely different application.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Okay, of course. We can imagine. For example, as lets say. A kind of many in the middle. Of the service architecture, a kind of. Well actually. Yep, exactly. Is something who takes ASR output checks it and forwards it to the machine translation. Its not that easy to imaginate working in the actual ORGANIZATION5 service architecture.",
            "I think its, let me just quickly say how if I had to implement it how I would do it. But correct me if I'm wrong. So there is this segmentation workers, that normally takes that take text. And then publish other text somehow modified under different fingerprint obviously. So I think that if we had the same. Like a segmentation worker style. For interfacing the the mediator. And then this would be running in one thread in a multi thread application, and the user interface would be running in a separate thread,, then the user interface. So so the, the main. The main thread would be always doing plain copy. Whatever I get as the ASR output. I directly emmit. So there will be no human involved in in for most of the time. But every now, and then the the human with its with. It is the very slow speed. They would realize, oh, there is something bad. Lets kill this stream for now. So they would click on the on the preview, and the the main a thread would be notified don't emmit anything from now on. So this. This would be the met men in the middle console would be a multi thread application. One thread serving the user user interface, and then the two or more threads, or one one or more threads. Serving the interseption of the workers. And each of these additional threads would be indeed the the worker for the, for the mediator setup. So. If one the the way the one would start this. Would that I would launch the platform. The platform would register itself as an interception worker for all these different languages that I can review as a person. And then the the the main like clients that start that provide the sound or whatever to the to the mediator. They would get started with such fingerprint so that the pipeline goes through my interception system and then yes everything would start. As as as normally, everything would go through this interception system and this interception system would immediately emit what it receives. And at the same time. It would also present it on screen for each of these threads separately. And when I say block this one, it wont from prom produce any further output on those particle threads. So I think this is doable with the current mediator. And it is not too cumbersome actually, but obviously, it takes lot of time to implement. So I don't think that we'll be able to have it for for for June.",
            "No. For June no. But for me is a completely new requirements also for the project. We have to discuss it with PERSON2. Actually I I understood the point of course. And I will explain it to PERSON2.",
            "So lets quickly finish this. The worker was simply pass the allowed stream back to the mediator for further processing. More such workers could be connected simultaneously thats the multiple threads that I set. For human operators, capable of accessing English alone or English and Czech and German. So if I'm confident in three languages. I would be just looking at these these, at these subtitles. And I would say yes yes yes, these all go. So these workers should attachable to both ASR outputs as well as outputs. What are these cascades. As well as yeah, to one another to form short and simple cascade. So one of the cascades could be our PROJECT1 case. One stream selection worker would be for Czech from English with operator needs to speak Czech and German. So, into. This is this is my note.",
            "Dont worry.",
            "You say that someone is talking English its translated to Czech. And then its translated to German. Probably.",
            "Yep, exactly. Yeah okay, so what I'm saying is that, in the cascade there is indeed one selection worker. For Czech and German. So this is one person who speaks Czech and German, and here he sees how the ASR of Czech look, and how the ASR. So the operator validates the ASR outputs of Czech ASR and of German ASR. He can block any of them at any time. Then the empty systems are attached to each of these separate streams. So one Czech to English AS empty system is attached. And one German to English system is attached there. And there is like a second stream selection worker in the pipeline. And thats someone who checks the quality of the English that we got. So we got the English. So this is the original. So we have the English from the floor. We have the English as respoken and recognized. English respoken and. English from Czech yeah. And English from, so this is English empty output from German to English system from German. And this German actually got created by AS from German ASR from German interpreter interpreting Czech. Yeah so this is. No. Yeah this is the same, I think that was that was already the one. So there will be multiple Englishes available. And for each of these Englishes the operator will again choose the best one yeah, so the. So ideally we would have this huge setup with two persons one validating the various inputs of the ASR. And another one selecting the best English.",
            "Ok. The second one is already planned in the presentation platform. And the first one is what we talked before regarding the many in the middle solution lets say. Which is actually for me. We have to discuss.",
            "Except except the way except the way of planned this second one. Is that only at the stage of subtitles. Its not before any empty.",
            "No, only at the stage of subtitles.",
            "So that means that we would have to the problem of this set up that you have now is is left in the like better than nothing. But the problem is that we would need to be able to review Hungarian.",
            "It it could be explained to be could be done before subtitle publishing. But still at subtitle level.",
            "Yeah, but then still that that would not help. So the the problem that I'm pointing at is that in our in the overall PROJECT2 setup. There is up to 43 target languages, and we cannot expect to have validators for each of those. So thats why its important to review already the input to the machine translation systems.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I dunno if if you have already put effort into this review of the subtitles, ma-ma maybe yes maybe no. But I don't think that its important for PROJECT2 setup.",
            "Okay.",
            "So.",
            "Its much more important to have a review before machine translation step for you.",
            "I would say so, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm I'm not sure if if PERSON3 is still on the call. PERSON3 are you there? Yeah I dunno.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yes now we can hear you. So PERSON3, what dou you think, what is more important to review subtitles before they are published or to review the machine translation outputs.",
            "Sentence hello? Can you start sentence again?",
            "Yeah. So we were discussing what is more important, whether to review the subtitles in their final language before they are published, or whether it is more important to review already the input to the machine translation system. And my argument is that the input of the machine transitions system is more important, because it will be English most likely. And we will have. It is easy to find operators to validate English. But it is difficult or impossible to have operators, validating all the different target languages that, that the whole setup will produce.",
            "I agree also I agree because I would probably use just the English ASR and maybe not even use the translation. Participants. So I think also expecting expect more problems on the ASR side than the translation but I'm just guessing you are the one who should know.",
            "Yeah yeah. Yeah so so. PERSON9 at what stage is the development of this subtitle reviewing. Is it only planned.",
            "No no the the. The review is not yet implemented. We are still reasoning about these function. Actually starting from this. I have already a couple of points. And a couple of modifications inside the document. And this is why we asked you to have this kind of. Yep.",
            "Yeah thank you. So as I said I don't think its worth while for the PROJECT2 setup. To review the subtitles only.",
            "I've got to point also for the having people speaking so many different languages. Okay actually it could not be done at presentation layer lets say. Should be done at the different layer and this is not what we planned. We have to talk with PERSON2 regarding these points. But I absolutely got the point.",
            "Yeah okay, thank you. So again we can scroll up to the screen and up to the document. So we have discussed the presentation modes. So we we've jumped from this to restart this session must reconnect automatically. So this reconnection is automatically reconnection obviously applies also to the setups once there are this this automatic this this like men in the middle workers. And it has to be compatible, so the men in the middle will probably like just mute some of the outputs. And technically muted output is is, okay,? But it is not delivering any signals. So the presentation platform should jump to the non muted ones. So that is the the thing is the into account when when designing how to exactly implement it. And, the next point is just a summary of foreseen uses of the presentation platform. In the fallback solution of for ORGANIZATION2 SL yes yes. So this this in the last call on Friday, when PERSON7 brought up the the critical a milestone in August. Where what we should have some spoken language translation, a preliminary version available in ORGANIZATION2. I said that the fallback solution for the ORGANIZATION2 platform. Is that all the remote meeting participants of ORGANIZATION2 session. Will be sending their audio to ORGANIZATION5 mediator. This has been tried. But then ORGANIZATION2 has cancelled that I believe, because they are doing the recording on their own. But they should get back to the recording anyway. That you they should get back to sending the audio to ORGANIZATION5 mediator anyway. And then, for the participants to receive the the the translations. They would open a separate web browser window where they would be looking at the ORGANIZATION5 presentation platform. They should be again, able to select one language. But all subtitles,, will be present in that language. So it is merging outputs from all other ORGANIZATION2 meeting participants.",
            "Mm-hmm, the. I I've got the point of this solution on Friday and I talk about it with PERSON2. We were reasoning about the fact that the main solution, the one completely integrated the ORGANIZATION2 platform. Should have one speaker sends his audio through the ORGANIZATION2 platform. But receives only subtitles of all the other participants and not its owns. Which was a pretty strange for me, and they talk about it with PERSON2. And and. He has add another point to the overall reasoning. He told me what if the if the speaker doesnt see his his subtitles. How could it he be able to to understand if people are reading something wrong for example. Something wrong coming out from his his transcription. And actually its a good point for me. I think that. My opinion. Okay.",
            "People should see also the ASR of their own a voice.",
            "Yeah, I think that we should be much more preferable.",
            "Yeah, Yeah, I agree,, like I havent realize this during the Friday call. But I think an important part of the success of this set up is that people adapt their pronunciation. So that really, always like misunderstanding what what I'm saying. I will try to say differently.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So. The there is still an issue with the like on the will with the the load on the on the brain of the speaker. If I'm speaking, and if I was hearing my voice. In my in my headphones with some delay. It would confuse me, and I would not be able to speak.",
            "Yes. But probably the conference system doesnt let you hear your own voice.",
            "Yes yes yes. But I'm worried from this confusion if I see my messages being transcribed in front of me with some delay.",
            "OK.",
            "So this is similar. It it like works on on a different part of the brain. It is reading and not listening. But still I think that for some people, it may be a very disrupt like disturbing to read. It would be with the delay of of four seconds, for example.",
            "But actually we work a lot in the dictation field. And we actually, we perform just the automatic transcription, then the delay its usually in much nowhere its around 3 seconds lets say. From one to three seconds. People interacting, which this kind of systems feel not that uncomfortable they just put the posies in their speaking waiting for their outputs. Which is not that bad.",
            "Thats not that bad. Thats thats good to know its that you have this experience. So putting this, so I agree with PERSON2 and you. So putting this back to the particle setup for the, ORGANIZATION2 case you would need to present the outputs of the ASR. To the person immediately. So the lack must not be increased by the ORGANIZATION2 platform. And its also important to realize that the stream mix in very diverse ways. So if I'm if I'm talking in English, and you are only talking Italian then, like I need to see myself from the English ASR with very immediate response. And I'm happy to get the translation from Italian ASR to English with some delay. Technically on your side it is coming from different sessions. I think. So that the the this is like this is not relevant for the workshop in June at all, but it is relevant for the overall design of the remote conferencing for ORGANIZATION2 for the upcoming years of the project. So thank you for revising, the, even you can you can modify the the document the main call and then say that you have discussed this later on and you think that the person should see theri own speech transcribed and all that. Just modified so that we have that information. And yeah think about it in in planning further.",
            "For actually for as fallback solution it will prefectly work at one you propose the for the August milestone. Then, if if we can we are able to run it at June it will for sure work also in August.",
            "Yeah, thank you. So the presentation platform connects to many sessions, right? I think.",
            "Actually it doesnt connect anywhere. It receives.",
            "Or observes many sessions. Or. Yeah yeah thats good. So exactly to t for this presentation platform to serve for the August milestone. There would be only some like book keeping or like orchestration.",
            "Sorry. Sorry PERSON4 I lose the the audio, can you repeat it please?",
            "Yeah. So for the for the August milestone, I think that, the only, thing that would be missing would be like some orchestration. When multiple people connect to the ORGANIZATION2 platform, all of them open some URL. This URL on the your server side it needs to know the various ideas of the of the sessions that it should present concurrently. So this like orchestration, that happens at the beginning of the call will be missing. But its not too complicated and the platform itself already will will work very well. Okay, exactly. The actually I'm not aware of the technology choosen to develope the presentation platform. But it could also be the case where the URL of one streaming one subtitles is it could be in further lets say starting from the languages and so we can put some kind of automatic system of who allows people to open directly on the correct page. But I'm just lets say. Just reasoning about it right now. Its not yet planned.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But we could be done probably.",
            "Okay, so. This is thats very good to hear and whenever you can talk to ORGANIZATION2 when you are in touch with ORGANIZATION2.. Please remind them that they need to send audio to you at least. If that so that the the fallback solution is,, is doable for for the August.",
            "Well, if they want to have some kind of. Subtitles, they need to send us the audio for transcription. Yeah it will probably, it will probably done.",
            "Well but but but they so so far they have like skipped away from that. They they've decided to do the all the recording themselves.",
            "Yep. Encountered some problem interfacing with us due to the fact that they belong they developing. And we havent. Exactly.",
            "Yeah, this this problem has not gone away. So, we need to like reopen it and and implement it anyway.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Okay. That is that is very good. So we've already discussed this. The HTML viewer so the if you send me some. I can try my streaming,, the presentation platform were also run in the full screen mode. One thing that I would like to have here is.",
            "Yep.",
            "No, no, you are completely right.",
            "And PERSON1 has read the the proposal. I was not able to talk to him directly. He just send me short message in Czech. And he says that it is it is all sounds reasonable. That he only says that for debugging purposes. It would be useful a to test presentation platform with audio and video from file, and.",
            "Ok.",
            "Like and subtitles that are like pretranslated. So, that the the you, you can test the whole thing, even without ASR workers and without empty workers running. So I'll I'll translate it.",
            "It will probably not be prepared. Ok. I understand it the bug proposes of course. But putting the possibility of for example uploading an audio file or us SR SRT files, which are the subtitles lets say. In the platform directly in the platform it its its a different functional requirements, probably we can arrange client lets say, who takes video and file and send it to the platform.",
            "Yeah I think thats the way PERSON1 also meant it not that the platform itself would digest the files, but rather that we that there are command lines that take the audio and the subtitles and they simulate and stream it stream it to the plat to the mediator.",
            "Maybe it could be done with VLC. Software. Because on VLC you are able to of course open a video file open subtitle and then stream them.",
            "So thats thats VLC also stream the subtitles? I don't think so.",
            "I dunno. But could be. Could be actually is a really powerful software. We can expect it.",
            "I know that so the the the streaming that I use for my tests. Are internally probably very similar to what VLC does. So VLC probably runs its own server. The protocol server. So I do I'm doing this just on the command line. But yeah yeah. Yeah. And one another thing that he would like to have is the, to agree on the simple plain text format. Which will contain the subtitles. So the question is like. What is the, data format for subtitles. And you've mentioned SRT. Is that the thing or not.",
            "Well, actually, probably in the presentation platform there will be just a text field. Lets say. This because I'm not aware of any any worker yet running on the mediator that it is able to output directly some kind of subtitle format. And the text field solution is the most flexible one.",
            "And when you say text fill.",
            "Field.",
            "Text field, yeah. So with every message, the field will be like fully replaced with what.",
            "Yes.",
            "Or how does it work actually. How does it yeah, this is this is quite important for the end user, like end points for the web thing, because it is extremely useful to be able to scroll somewhat in the in the past transcript.",
            "We reason about it of course but the main drawbacks of having the whirlign text is that. If the system has outputs some kind of terrible error. Users are are exactly. And this is the reason why we choose to replace each time. Also because if people choose language of course people are able to choose just one language you asked for having at most to different languages. But this is a different point. If people change a language while subtitles are running. Of course,, on their personal devices previous subtitles on the different language are not available. Then you, you will not be able always to subtitles and this is and also another drawbacks.",
            "Yeah so this would. This would be okay, with me. So I think its, it would be totally okay for the client to cash only the subtitles it has seen. So if I have, if I'm have not followed German, and I suddenly start. I will only start receiving German from now on this is. This is OK. The, the thing about like hiding the bad outputs with by by replacing them with the newer ones. I would prefer from the user's point of view, I would prefer to have this scrolling capacity. Even if it contains the bordering words, because very often for me,. It would be too like I would I would like to have some more time to to read the subtitles. And if they disappeared, then I'm I'm screwed. So, obviously, not for the full screen mode. But I think that for the end user, usecase as well as for the ORGANIZATION2 setup. It would be very useful. To see the messages like as as they extend. So in in the same way, as the lecture translator has it. So the lection translator gradually expands. What what is there. And then so so maybe maybe it is indeed, just the client like logic in the client. So that the underlying concept is indeed, the stacks fields. You are receiving text fields. And as long as the text field has the same beginning, you keep extending the text field. And then when the new beginning comes, you will say, \"well, this next tex field has been closed. Lets make it like black, move it upwards and then start putting the new text field, again in grey or dark grey there as as it being extended.",
            "And what if. Sorry, what if the end user select for example Italian subtitles then moves to the German subtitles and then moves back to Italian subtitles. It will be he sorry will not be completed.",
            "Yes, the history will be rainbow. The history will be in all the languages he has chosen.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I think the is the best setup. If you is the screen size permits. And if your user interface would permit this. I would like to have like two such two or possibly even three such windows next to each other. And in the first one I would start with English in the second one I would start with German. And the third I will start with Czech. I would be receiving histories in three languages. The way that I just described. Then I would see that the Czech is garbage so I would switch the Czech to Swedish if I can speak Swedish obviously. And then I would skip I would keep seeing the complete English, because I was following that this all the time. I would have there the whole German as well and for Czech and Swedish. I would have the respective parts that I saw in the in the respected languages. So this way. If we have multiple views, rolling views. That behave the same way. Then I can let one of these views to keep following English, so that I can always refer the. And I can play around with my main language. Whichever I choose. And yeah, so this is the most flexible.",
            "Um-hum okay. I will talk about it with the development team. Of course, I will extend the functional analysis, and I will send you the, updating documents.",
            "Um-hum. Um-hum. Okay, so I'll say past subtitles.",
            "I wonder say if the ASR decide it decides the first something now.",
            "Thats a good.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Yeah. So PERSON3 remind that the ASR can sometimes review its decisions. So actually yeah so. Decision when input is finished, should not be based on the prefix identity but rather on timestamps.",
            "Okay, you are talking about partial hypothesis output the workers. Well actually in the last calls, we PERSON8 didnt participate and probably he's the one who will have some kind of answer for us. But I expect that their their outputs partial hypothesis partially but at at some point says, which one is the final one. Because is the is the usual behavior probably is just matter configuration. Oh, actually I hope so.",
            "So the ASR should tell us what is final at that point the the presentation platform should move to the new text field. Still this is this is tricky. The segmentation is is tricky.",
            "Yes the, partial hypothesis may change also time-stamps, of words, even even words stays the same. I dunno how you manage it in the in the. Okay. Exactly.",
            "So so at the March fair. It was were systems, the lecture translator. And it worked reasonably well. For if if there was no translation involved and for the translation itself. The the Czech translation there was some crashing client. And that had very long, a lag, because it was always waiting for the full sentence, and only then it sent it to the machien translation, For the German a translation into German of their lag was shorter. And it was like fixing, it was updating the the empty output. But still, it was like swallowing words, and even the ASR was swallowing words. It it produced some good part of the sentence. And then suddenly it decided that this is not a like not valid for some reason. But it was good. It was matching the what the speaker said. And it replays this whole part with what he said after that. So it was like.",
            "It was not working actually.",
            "It was updating to so to say. So its somehow decided that that he has corrected himself but he has not.",
            "Its tricky at this point.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. And what I'm also very much concerned about is if we rely on the ASR doing the segmentation. Then the there could be too much text. Collected to present in the in the text field, like not that the computer will struggle with that. But the layout of the user interface will struggle with that.",
            "In fact as lets say future works. We have to reason also about subtitles readability. Because, of course, you know that there are rules to let the subtitles be readable. And we have to take care of it.",
            "Um-hum, yeah exactly. So there could be again, like subtitle readability worker, which would be connected at the end of ASR or at the end of machine translation and there it would be doing some online like readable subtitles.",
            "From machine translation actually. I'm not aware on how ORGANIZATION7 workers, ORGANIZATION7 machine translation works. But probably read they will always require in order to prepare better translation. The phrase. Been probably.",
            "No no, they.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we are also, thats what we discussed on Friday. And I think we discussed before the main on, but you were on both of the calls right?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Yeah, so we we discussed that machine transition has to accept partial sentences as well. So the machine transitional will run many times, for the same sentence. With its as the sentences gradually growing. So the machine translation should be emitting also updates. Including the time-stamps. So. The machine translation say that from these like minus five min seconds ago. There is the, the the translation. And then in the second after that, the next message will be still from the very same origin, minus five now minus six seconds. Here is the output,, and it will be slightly extended hypothesis. So.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Yeah, so, I think that the, that, the subtitle, readability worker,, should have like accept this stream of updates, and it should somehow balance what the what on the on the screen, and where to put new lines into that. And then, when there is an update from newer timestamp it would say ok the previous one is is finished and never never opening back. So I hope. I dunno but I hope that the ASR is never a like going back to the past. So if it if it once closes, if it once moves the timestamp like the originmark in of timestamps if it once moves it forward. I hope it never update the previous segment anymore. But I'm not sure.",
            "Me neither.",
            "Ok.",
            "That would be useful feature to not open them again. But for a transcript it would make sense if it if the ASR could revise even five sentences. Yes.",
            "Thats the offline mode. So I don't think not concerned about the offline mode here at all. So PERSON9. What in in your whole document. Is there something which we have not touched, and we should have.",
            "It is a good question. Let me check it briefly. Oh maybe lets have a check to typical translation table. I'm moving to. Oh this one. Because actually I checked need grant agreement document, but I havent found any any indica.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, indication regarding how many concurrent user. How long are the session. Or and so on. So probably this is one of the parts that its probably needs to be checked. First of all how many concurrent user should support the platform.",
            "Yeah, 1000 per day does it mean. Yeah, up to 1000 concurrent. I think thats totally okay. PERSON3 confirm for the for the congress. The congress will have 400 participants. Uh-huh, half of them will be following this on their handheld devices. And when I say half them. One participant can actually be more devices at the same time. So I think that this 1000 concurrent users is just about, what we expect. It is an upper bound for the people on on the edge at the venue. And I dunno know if we should worry about people attaching from abroad. Then. Yes, this could be like more, but I don't think it will grow an order of magnitude in higher. So if you design for, or if you tested for 1000. I think we should be okay even with remote participants being curious of the congress. PERSON3 can you yes?",
            "Reasonable, also I expect that you will have some kind of cash or something on the side that the participants on side will consume different net worker participants abroad. Does it make sense.",
            "Yes, and also the platform who host lets say the presentation platform may support so many connection multiple connection.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That I will probably write 4000.",
            "Yeah, right, 4000 per day and in that case I think we are we are good.",
            "Yes. In the solution must be available also offline. Lets say, it should be hosted locally within the conference. If something happened to the Internet connection, for example.",
            "Actually, we are planning to be online only. Because.",
            "Okay.",
            "The translation workes and so on. I think they, it would be really too much work to to make them installable offline.",
            "Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Because in the March fair. We prepare everything to be available also offline so I was thinking it should be the same.",
            "That was like for the booth.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "So the, it was not as a fallback it was not planned as a fallback if the network breaks down. But it was because we know that there it would be impossible to get some network to the presentation booth. So that was the reason why it was prepared, but that was ORGANIZATION7 offline setup. And for yeah I think we'll simply have to rely on internet connection.",
            "Okay.",
            "For both the the June workshop, and also for the main event.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Confirm or it should be really cautious, and should we try this a lot of work. This is like stealing.",
            "I agree. That would be crazy to do not intelligent to stream everything from say abroad to everyone of the devices. I was, I thought more about this part of the.",
            "Yeah thats right so the thing that should be really,, carefully designed is the distribution of the, of the the the whole thing to the participants at the venue. Because their WIFI would be failing.",
            "Well probably, we will lets say publish it maybe on the internet lets say, so people may use their own internet connection.",
            "But then the like. Yeah okay, but still then I think that we could even overload the LTE. 400 people will start following than the network has no information about the identity the the the the whole thing is the same. The network. So the network will do 200 copies of this if if 200 people start watching videos on their cell cell phones. I don't think that this this works.",
            "It wont work. Okay. Okay, we have to be careful in designing the solution for the local connection.",
            "So is there, this this again. Please take a note. I don't, I don't have the experience. But if you have network engineers around. Then I think what should be viable would be some WiFi broadcasting. So that like the stream is being sent once once for all. And anybody can can like steal the information and show it in the in the presentation platform.",
            "But probably it could be done. But again, everyone that is connecting to the local network. In order to catch the streaming, which she sent just one and stored locally. Everyone has to connect to these local placing in order to get the streaming.",
            "Yeah yeah but the thing, is how the the stream, the stream itself the data. So there is obviously individual negotiation for by the way, the subtitles, because I need to select subtitles that in my language of choice. But the the video is the more demanding part. And I think it could be possible the video to be send by UDP packets to like a broadcast address that everybody can read. So that all the, so the packets of containing the video signal would be sent in such a way that actually all the devices react together and display them.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "But I'm not network engineer like. My knowledge is not deep enough to, to be sure about this. And also to be sure about, web web, based the viewers of such stream of packets. So PERSON3 do you have any any experience with this, or or any any knowledge about broadcasting a videos.",
            "I would say no. But, I would something else. I as you that the in the call the specification for WiFi, I'm not sure how it was specified but it should be able to deliver the video, it they should deploy sufficient amount of access point. So the the viewer separated in segments or something that so, they have available. To where I expect more problems is the internet connection if its not multiplied on some local server.",
            "Well, yeah, I'm quite sceptical. I'm, I live in, just like a block of flats. And when the UPC the cable cable Tv company brought internet. Everybody bought one WiFi router and from that point on the Internet for everybody got much worse. So it is not the bottleneck of the internet connection, but its actually the bottle neck of the of the channels. So if there are two WiFi's talking over the same channel. Then it is already like a complicated. You should be using channels like not not in not immediately neighboring channels. You should be using. You should skip like one channel number,, and there is too many apartments around. So. I think that even if this company brings the the the the WiFi like routers,, and they all deliver the same network of the the network with the same assets. It is a network ID, over all the available channels. If. All the people of the connect to this. Maybe. You, can locate people. So that. Like one 10th uses. There is only fourteen channels,, or if even less in in Europe. And if you if you divide people into the groups 10 groups. Still, if all the people that would be a. If there are 400 people. It could be indeed 1000 devices. But lets. Lets think 500 devices. You know, if we have 500 devices divided by 10 that is 50 people on one a channel. We should actually double this because you should not use channels next to each other. So it would be 100 notebooks on one channel. And if 100 people start following the same video, and they receive like we ship the video 100 times, then it wont work.",
            "If they use home routers, they obviously wont. I mean there is a big difference when there are cheap routers that do not cooperate in neighbouring flats. And if equipment that negotiates between the routers and cooperates and also if all direction at once. I think company can do this.",
            "I dunno I'm I'm from the well from the school lof computer science and our network. Our network people told us that its virtually impossible to gather for 100 notebooks in one room. So.",
            "Let me tell you, its impossible what you currently or impossible don't have a lot of money.",
            "I think impossible even if you have a lot of money. I think its."

            "Try to record it if it works. Now it seems that it is working. Yeah, I see that it is recorded. And now I will try to share my screen. And share. And, can you see that?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes,.",
            "I just wanted to show,, PERSON7. And could you look at the data at my screen now? PERSON7?",
            "I think he is there.",
            "Er, PERSON7, are you? Okay. If if PERSON7 is not here,, I will just show it.",
            "Oh sorry I just opened up the window. I I just.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So I managed to share the screen and,, please take a look at my screen now. I just. One thing,, you sh, have dec, have to decide when we speak about Git and other repositories. So in each meeting folder.",
            "Yes.",
            "We have different types of files. And some files are kind of. So it is clear that we exclude this,.",
            "Yes.",
            "Big files. And then it is cle, clear that we include these annotation annotated files. This with,, minutes and transcripts, and,,, this transcript,, automatic transcript. And the question is also, if we include some other additional files. So there is a lot of something. That,,, was created during the,,, speech recognition. So some kind of stuff that I expect that is not actually needed. At least it is not need it for me, but it could be needed for somebody else. So, there could be some additional questions by organising the folders. So, this is just the wanted to say that we will. Sorry. If, if you discuss it with PERSON2 without me, there are some additional files in the folder.",
            "Why would I discuss it without. I mean this, this should be discussed all together. So.",
            "Well, hopefully, hopefully. We will discuss it all together. I just wanted to say.",
            "I always, I always email to the minuting,, to the minut,, email list.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "I never email to a person specific so there is no reason to discuss it without you.",
            "Okay. Then, just.",
            "So,, well,, we normally exclude the big files. So, we want to include everything possible, because we need the information. But from the other hand we cannot include everything, because it's too big. So we will try to compromise if I may.",
            "Yes, yes. Okay.",
            "To find some reasonable let's say rule. And apply it in all the folders. So.",
            "Yes. But let's do it within next week, so.",
            "I'm checking the sizes right now and I see that besides the. So it. Everything is in kilobytes so if we exclude the MP4 files, then everything else would be included.",
            "Yes, okay,.",
            "So, its only the recordings, I don't see other big files that.",
            "Yeah, but there could be some stuff that nobody, that no one needs. So its actually, no need to include it.",
            "I don't know.",
            "Let's, let's see it together.",
            "It has no sense to discuss it now. I I don't think it's so. When we do it together, we will discuss it.",
            "It is, yeah, so. I don't see anything big besides the recordings.",
            "Well everything else is in, in kilobytes and kilobytes it's not problem. We can, we can push it.",
            "Yes, yes. Okay.",
            "But there, there should be a way. PERSON2 was not clear if the development is going to be in one place or in two. So it's not really clear what to do with the rest, like in the future. When adding some other.",
            "Yes. This is. That's why I think about. Yes, de, definitely. I, that's.",
            "So, like how is it gonna be? I don't know. For the moment that's it from me now.",
            "So what?",
            "So what, so what are you actually saying PERSON7 for the development of? Like for the about the other repository?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Yeah. So you were telling about something like are you at about something, like having the detail that you can put also in the repository? Or?",
            "Yes, PERSON2 asked to create a repository. For storing the data set, the minuting, PROJECT1 minuting data set. But he was not clear like how to do it, why to do it, like how. I mean, because also PERSON6 said that it cannot be a public repository, because the data is not only so there are some issues to discuss about this. And and so we will also have to exclude this MP4 video recordings because they are big and we cannot store them in GitHub. And then its the issues with the rest of the work like how is it going to? How are the annotators going to proceed? They will put everything in GitHub only or they will keep also the cluster storage or? There are synchronisation issues. So, its not clear. This thing is not clear.",
            "We will discuss it I think as we meet, meet with PERSON2 and we will just come to the agreement.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. I don't.",
            "I think it will also benefit, I think it would also benefit when we release the data. Because we we can directly make the private repository to be public. Once we release the data for the shared task.",
            "I think that the GitHub repository will help us in that case.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay so. What else are we going to discuss today?",
            "I have nothing.",
            "PERSON7? Yeah, go ahead.",
            "No, please go on because I was just thinking,, I don't know of anything to discuss. So if you have some questions or something, like you can ask me.",
            "I don't think I have right now.",
            "So we are having a session with PERSON1 tomorrow. Like know more about the, about the, about the, about the various, servers, CPU. So yeah, hopefully if you would have some more questions the day after for you.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "PERSON7 what other works you were involved in. Like apart from this minuting? Now I'm waiting for a response. I am waiting for a response from Colling I have a paper there. So.",
            "Aha. Fingers crossed.",
            "It's it's very long like. Since end of June. Like more than June, July, July, August. More than. It's almost three months, so. Yes, I do not know why they're delaying the response so long. And it was also confirmed that it will be online. It was supposed happen in, to be in Barcelona this year. Which is very beautiful city. But Spain is facing the second wave, and they decided to do it online. So, so it's it's not funny. Even if I get accepted.",
            "I've been to Colling,, last last time it was in Santa Fe,, in New Mexico and yes, Colling was really nice. They had those excursions, exhibitions, so.",
            "Yes. I've seen that they have like a record number of submissions. Like.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Like two thousand four hundred or two thousand five hundred this year.",
            "Which is a record number.",
            "I just, I just submitted a paper in. And it was something in a range of eight thousand. Like oh my God. I don't know.",
            "Yes. So it is also happening in the other.",
            "I had, I had two rejections. Yeah. I had two rejections this this month. And it's just because like the papers are not within scope. I don't know why it is, so. Like we are also working on submitting it to some other venues you know. And it has to be so much for the late production that the parts are according to the, according to the aims of that of that venue. Yeah. What about PERSON3?",
            "I'm wa working only on minuting right now. Nothing else.",
            "Okay, okay. Wonderful, wonderful. Yeah, so you are the leader for us.",
            "I, I just passed, finished my degree so.",
            "So, what about PERSON6? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "PERSON6 what, what, what, yeah, yeah what other works you were doing? Apart from the minuting?",
            "Oh, well, I'm also working on,, wor,, morphology project. On one morphology project. And I am. During the last days I did a lot of reviewing of the papers. So I am, I was really busy with reviewing some papers for PERSON4, linguistic ones.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I will polish the data. It takes quite a lot of time and as from the minuting side for organizing the annotators. Because we write a lot of emails and. Kind of.",
            "So I get like lots of.",
            "I understand PERSON6, because do you know like during. Go ahead PERSON3.",
            "I think that my audio is a little late. So I okay you go ahead. So it's I think. Yeah.",
            "So I know PERSON6 like how like how to deal with the annotators so. I have developed four data sets as a past of my Phd. So I know what what kind of mess it could be. So yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And still one like we are continuously developing and actually that data set paper got rejected from TLSN. And we were are very disappointed, because it was such nice paper. And we have put at least nine months of effort into that paper.",
            "So, yeah. But, we are again like trying to reformat it and send it to somewhere else, but. It was it was it was so close to my heart. That paper.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I really wished that it was.",
            "And what about the.",
            "Concept.",
            "And what about this systematic literature review. Because some time ago you said you were going to do a systematic review.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, we are doing that PERSON7.",
            "Yes, that would be good. As a start.",
            "And we are overwhelmed; we are overwhelmed with the number of papers that are already there. In some area of the research.",
            "But you have to focus in something specific. You you should not go broad, in broad. Well, you have to to focus in some aspect.",
            "Yes.",
            "So PERSON7?",
            "That is not already out there, because other my otherwise that are many others. Other systematic reviews about machine, about,, yes,, machine text summarization and other things.",
            "So you should try to find a pattern in the papers that you read and come. Let's say a common pattern or something. And the focus in that and try to do the review in that thing.",
            "So PERSON7 we thought that, we thought that specifying only the,, the minute,, meeting summarization.",
            "Yes,, well, I think there are already some of them. I'am not sure about it. But yes, it's it's. I I think it's I think it's enough specific. If it. It is enough specific so it could be something good like, maybe. I am not sure if there are some broad reviews.",
            "So we have just one minute and it will get disconnected.",
            "May just just please PERSON7 did you see that.",
            "Yeah, just a minute to in a call.",
            "Did you see it in, in, in, ORGANIZATION3,, in ORGANIZATION3 PERSON8,, shared with us the papers. So you can take a look at them.",
            "The papers?",
            "Maybe PERSON8 could you also share the papers with.",
            "I see, I see some dialogs here, lines.",
            "In drive, not the dialogs, but in drive. In the ORGANIZATION3 dri, drive there is a folder.",
            "Yes, I will, I will, I will share that link. I will share that link.",
            "Yes.",
            "I think help. Because PERSON7 has the over the overview on the papers. It would be good.",
            "Yeah, yeah. PERSON7 has a good knowledge of,.",
            "Yes, I will do that.",
            "Yes, please.",

            "Yeah. Hi PERSON3, so I'm here.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great, yep.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you. So,, first of all how are you doing? Have you understood the the regulation that now applies to you?",
            "Yeah, I think so. I understand that I do not need to go outside except for work or buying groceries or medicines.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "And no one necessarily walking outside.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I was working on the karaoke and I didn't understand what exactly needs to be done here. So I have,, written here few,, a few of my doubts.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I'll start with the first of them. So, okay, okay, okay. So,, I need to understand like what exactly,, the forced aligner does. So in the forced alignment review that input as adjacent file which has multiple adjacent objects during the duration of the audio path you know. That's the test segment.",
            "Yeah, that is, that is just like a file list. So the adjacent is essentially just a file list which tells tells you what all files should be processed. And it paralyses them as it as it likes. And,, for each of them you provide the text and it it will emit the words aligned to some positions in the time. So this is only like a batch procession of of a a large number of files.",
            "Okay. So,,, am, so as far as I know the forced aligner it also does ASRs. So are we deliberating the ASR in any way?",
            "Oh,, well in internally it uses ASR because it searches. It tries to process the input and then it finds in in the full of candidates where the words that we require are located. So we we don't make the use of this ASR ourselves. It is being used by the forced aligner. And that's it. So we only want to see the time stamps.",
            "I I am not sure if I understand that. Like,, what does,, the how does the forced alignment uses the ASR?",
            "It it processes the input sound. It creates like a lattice like a set of candidates and then in this set of. So the good thing about this set of candidates is that it knows where the words were found. But it doesn't know which words are the correct ones.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And,, by itself. So if it's only the normal ASR it will then emit the most likely candidates from this set. But in the forced set up you are telling it pick this word pick this word pick this word and so on. So you are choosing path in the lattice but the lattice is all time stamped. And when you chose the path, you will know the time stamps at which these words occurred in the, in the, in the, in the speech. So that's exactly how you obtain the alignments.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. So basically the times, the time stamps after each word that is done by the forced aligner. And yeah, okay, I start to get some sense out of it.",
            "It's as if if a human was doing, if a human was doing it. You would you would be like listening. If it was like a very slow pace, you would be writing down a time when you heard the word and as a human you would already get the single best path. You would understand it perfectly. So then you would only like copy form your time stamped record the times to the, to the expected output.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay, I get it.",
            "Yeah, so what it, what it. The the karaoke. The reason why we want to do this karaoke is that we want quick visual inspection of this word,, word aligned, or word time stamped transcripts. So imagine -. This is what I was just doing,, for the IWSLT test set anonymisation. I was doing only the text part, so I was,, like reading the transcript and whenever I saw like one of the names of the participants of the meeting I replaced that name with censored, with with some key word only. And now the next step is for PERSON4 and he needs to find the appropriate position in in the recording and do the of that.",
            "I get it, yeah.",
            "And so if if he would be able to like scroll the movie which highlights the words then he would scroll the movie to the point where it shows censored and he would listen whether it's the right position. And I also kind of needed this facility. It is essentially,, like a full text search within audio. So,, I also needed this because when reading the transcripts, I realised there were some errors. Like some nonsensical sentences and I wanted to check,, whether the person has understood it the best way they could. So I had to scroll the movie, the the sound and it was like jumping and then searching where I am.",
            "If by playing the movie a I would see in the text the word highlighted.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "That would be perfect. That would have saved a lot of time.",
            "Yeah, I get it.",
            "So, so I think the. The most promising,,, approach is indeed the web based subtitles. So there is one more thing. IMSC1. I don't have any. I'll I'll paste the link to to chat window now. There is some render there. Have a look at that. I'm afraid that. Is downloaded here, okay, so there is there is some. Oh, the file is not found. So I'm not sure if this works at all. But. Media in seconds. Yeah. So this is some render of one of the formats of subtitles. Yeah and it is XML based TTML playing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is another important link that I found yesterday or the da day before yesterday and that's,, the jungle of video streaming. And it also has,, a section on. Oh, that's already about subtitles, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is the. If you scroll like to the fifth of the document,, quite early. From the Monty Python and the Holy Grail,, there is four,, four formats. So the burned into video, the open captions is what we want to achieve from something which is easier to produce for ourselves. So the TTML looks,,, like reasonable, that's what the render, that's what the render would be able to, to show. So yeah, this is a subtitle. The idea is here. So, there is -. The the oh so there is some diagram of different T, TTML profiles. That's crazy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "It's really like haven't read it yet. So this is obvly obviously overly complicated. Finally to bring some sense of the circus of profiles, yes. Recent specification, yeah,, IM, IMSC1 which is a new recommendation. So this IMSC1 is probably the best thing. Specification. And then fortunately -. And it,, consists of plain text but it can reference CSS for styling.",
            "Okay.",
            "So in one of the demo queues -. Start may be applied using simple mark up to appear at particular times. Yes, so if you search for the word karaoke in this document you exactly get the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the section web VTT.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So there is a specification. Supports play out of web PGE in a Apple HLS and MPEG dash. So web VT web VTT is the best thing. Unified packager can convert SRT.",
            "When preparing content as intended for use on the web only, web VGT has deeper integration which will probably make it better suited than TTML. Yes, so we should go for a web VTT.",
            "Okay.",
            "By doing this, we are already preparing for,, like the,, the sessions, the remote conferencing for example.",
            "So if we know how to produce web VTT then,, it's,, it will be useful,, useful later on. So this this IMSC1 is probably more complicated than needed. I don't know if there is any web VTT renderer. Web VTT renderer.",
            "So this karaoke will have the audio playing. I mean,, so like last week I chunked the audios, segmented the audios. So I need to, I need to concatenate all these audio segments. I mean.",
            "So, so, so, what you,, you you are talking about the Khan Academy, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly, I am.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So exactly, this is this is now needed. So, well I would first debug the the karaoke viewer on the individual segments. So do it segment by segment. But then, after,, the karaoke,, preview is is ready,, concatenate all the segments back.",
            "Or actually use the original the original file and concatenate the forced,,, the,, like time stamped,, captions.",
            "Okay.",
            "With concatenating of the,, of of this of the transcripts, you need to shift the time stamps obviously.",
            "Shift. Like what do you mean shift.",
            "Oh well, the problem is that in segment 1 time 0 means 0 but in segment 2 time 0 means something else. It's at the end of,, segment 1.",
            "The forced aligner runs always like from the beginning of the segment.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the timing of the words is relative to big relative to the beginning of the segment.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "But the beginnings of the segments like grow in time as as you proceed through,, through the recording.",
            "Aha. Yeah I've seen like I've just I was just playing some of the audios and it would I don't remember the word. It was. So the the audio is not properly captured inside that very audio segment.",
            "And and it's too little.",
            "So.",
            "So so the time stamps stamps were not exact so that's I I had to like,, you know play with the time stamps to get the actual audio captured. Or to hear the audio actually captured.",
            "Yeah, so I've played the set, the sequence of files that you have created the the simple karaoke.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And I've heard that it's like the word has been already said in on the previous word and only now the caption comes. So the captions are late.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "And I think the reason is that,, the neural network,, takes some time to process it in a way. So it is confident about the word only after the word has been finished.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "And I think that we can live with this. So the karaoke will will show this to us. And we could do some like a general little shift if we really like but I I think it's safer to to stick to what network has provided us with.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So,,, so,, there is two things the conversion of the output of forced aligner, which is the time stamped words. Into,, into the ka.",
            "Time stamped.",
            "Into the karaoke, into the VTT.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And and talk to PERSON1. So think.",
            "Okay.",
            "Is there already a script that converts the output of forced aligner to PERSON1's expected output? Which is the growing sentences. Or not yet?",
            "Yeah exactly. There is a script which PERSON1 created but I was playing with it last night but it didn't seem to work out.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I thought maybe it's an issue with the karaoke corpus is not able to process. I I even tried with the demo corpus. That demo directory which is n the forced alignment directory. And it it perfectly but I even.",
            "Aha.",
            "But the other one in the directory does not work. With this PERSON1's script so I I need to talk to PERSON1.",
            "Yes, please please talk to him and I think that format that his script provides. Which is the growing sentences is the ideal input format for,, for the web VTT view.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So,, we would be like gradually highlighting more and more of the sentence and then we would every now and then move to another subtitle and and again have the colour grow,.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So this is,, this is probably what we, what we want ot start with. So so you should first,, write these web VTT files manually just to see that it works.",
            "Then play with them, like have them appear, have them,, have them work in your set up.",
            "And then create the script which converts the growing sentences of PERSON1 into this web VTT for the for the life view of of for the preview of of these files. And then,, work on the concatenation of the Khan Academy,, transcripts,, so that the time stamps are properly shifted and then,, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, I just need to write it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the first step will be to convert the. I need to convert the subtitles into web VTT.",
            "Yeah, so learn how how to write the web VTT so that it highlight the beginning of the the first half of the subtitle and that you can grow the highlighted part in time.",
            "Okay, alright, alright.",
            "Then apply it on one of the segments and test that it works. And then apply it on the concatenated segments and test it against the original full non-split ASR. Non-split sound file.",
            "So I I'm still like confused. So first I the the karaoke, in karaoke so so the the audio that play in the background it will have. No the audio playing in the background in karaoke it will be the original audio with,, with the audio segment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, and the the subtitles. The, the, sorry, the the transcripts will be the original transcripts not from the forced aligner.",
            "From the forced aligner. Those. So the original -. When you say original transcript,, you mean the manually revised files which we called OST, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so the OST files contain only one sentence per line.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "And no time stamps so there is no way to display them. We need to move from OST to something which we call OSTT. So that's original sound transcript transcribed. Sorry sorry transcript time stamped. So the TT the second T is for time stamped,, and that is the format which has time stamps and the same line is like repeated and it's growing. In the same way as you,, know it from,, from the ASR outputs.",
            "And in order to get this OSTT I will use PERSON1's sript.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Okay, alright alright. So it will ahve the audio playing in the background and these OSTT.",
            "Yeah, so I will I will try to figer out, f find one video which displays the.",
            "Yeah exactly and.",
            "Yeah so this is like so no one is singing. Yeah, I'm searching -. Yeah, so here is one sample YouTube video where no-one sings. But if you wanted to sing like Elvis Presley,, you would you sing at the point when the word is, is being highlighted.",
            "Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah. I was -. Okay, so. I understand it better and it's more clear. One issue is that. I saw at first, in after the forced alignment, after every,. I mean so the forced aligner loses a few first words in the transcript.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "I'm not sure why.",
            "That's bad. So talk to PERSON2 about this. So I know that he has added something which ensures that,,, the for that his ASR processes full words. Because if you if you cut sound in the middle of the word it happily tries to like recover from that and it will recover this half word into a full word. So his search is for like a chunk, he he removes the head and tail so that he is confident that he has full words. But for the forced aligner we should not use this feature. So talk to him of what is the proper way of,, of using this forced aligner so that it doesn't chop out the the words.",
            "Okay.",
            "If it's something more complex. If he does not have this chopping off end, head and tail, then, well we're we're screwed. There is not. There is nothing we can do about it.",
            "So actually it does not happen in like all of the chunks but like in some. Okay so it's be better if I show you here.",
            "And I will start the. So can can you see this?",
            "Yeah. It said that you started. Yes I see something. But it's pretty small.",
            "Yeah, exactly. And I I okay.",
            "So maybe just Control + should increase the font size.",
            "Like this?",
            "Yes, it takes a while until it updates. So yes this is this readable. And I can see line number 2, line number 1 is still,, like obsured by your your window and my window. Oh no I can mo move it, okay. I cannot move myself, so,, -",
            "So yeah, even second segment is good. So you can see the segment. It starts from A.V.E-.",
            "F.",
            "Yeah, but it is about the second segment. But if you want this. I would like to show you this.",
            "This is, this is \"have\" this should be \"have\".",
            "I I I exactly so. The sentence is. The sentence is: \"Do I have to\".",
            "So even \"Do I?\"",
            "So it completely, so it completely missed this \"Do I\".",
            "Yeah. So talk to PERSON2. I have no idea what, why this could be happening. Send him these two files, the input file and the output file.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Just actually send him the path name of that,, of this adjacent files but copy paste that these two lines into the into the email right away.",
            "Yeah, exactly, exactly. So, yeah talked about this. Okay, so the last question is about an email which you sent a few days ago or probably last week.",
            "So you talked about the alphabets in forced alignments and there was this configuration file.",
            "And at the bottom point it w it had a list of letters which forced alignment accepts. So it was. If I properly understand what this means is that forced alignment can only accept a lower case letters, no punctuations and no upper case letters. Is that is that?",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Alright.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. Say.",
            "But beware I think that the Czech model accepts only upper case. So it's like -. That's very much configuration dependant.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "So, so have a look at the. For now you need only English forced aligner. So for now focus on the English.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And there is. I think it accepts apostrophe as well. But not new lines obviously and not,, not numbers so there. So we need to do some trick with numbers,, so the numbers should be actually spelled out.",
            "There are not too many numbers but there are some in the,, in the transcripts.",
            "Like what you mean of.",
            "Like 2020.",
            "2 0 in yeah in numbers.",
            "So if you have 2020 then in the transcript like as one word, like 4 characters 2 0 2 0. Then it should be spelled out in some way in which it was spelled out. In the,, in the text. So that's. Well this is annoying,, well we'll see how far we get with this, like. PERSON2 will know how to convert numbers to the spoken versions of them, because he. Also had to do it guess. So talk to him about this as well.",
            "Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",
            "For Czech, PERSON6 surely has a script that does that.",
            "Obviously the person, the person could have said the number differently,, and then we are screwed.",
            "But yeah. This is not so likely.",
            "So you you mean these numbers are not acceptable in the forced aligner.",
            "The forced aligner,, oh,, yeah, it's just yeah. It just, it just doesn't work. It excess it expects the the letters that corresponds to the,, to the like vowels and consonants of the to the phonemes in the in the speech. And if the letters are the the digit 2 then there,, is no clear correspondence to phonemes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah so it all. So basically I need to refer to the configuration files. Yeah, okay. And that is all that I have written down. And I will start working on this karaoke, then I will discuss with PERSON1 and then I I will start working on the log. To get the log directories for the,,, for the meeting for the last conference. And I -.",
            "Yeah, for the mock conference, great. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, for the mock conference.",
            "And when I, when I talked about the getting the versions of the systems. This is something which can be tested on anything, including the mock conferences obviously. So.",
            "Version of the system, like what do you mean.",
            "So like in the log dir we need to know which version of the ORGANIZATION1 system was in use.",
            "Okay, alright.",
            "This was, this was mentioned in the call,, this morning.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I understand, yeah.",
            "So this is, this also an opportunity to, to like work on that, on gathering that information.",
            "Okay, okay. And these log directories. So basically,, we had like, I don't know what we had appro, we had like 6 channel being spoken in this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this. These audio recordings have 6 channel so I need to separate each of them out and do the ASR.",
            "They are already separated.",
            "Oh, well the record cut script work for them. So maybe they are already separate files.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Or the record cut script, yeah.",
            "Okay, so by preparing you mean generating the ASR and generating the MNTs, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Time stamped.",
            "Yes, so for for now you need to do it for each of the channels separately.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And you can do it one by one. You do not have to do it at the same time.",
            "Yeah, exactly, yeah.",
            "The good thing about these channels is that they start at very same. They are synchronised.",
            "So they start at the time 0 and that's perfect. So, that means that we can then observe all the many different English versions and the time stamps will will match. So we would be like playing for ourselves the different English versions simultaneously and trying to figure out which of them is the best at the given moment. So we should like. So when you prepare these log dirs we should then run a test session with annotators including ourselves and,, figuring out at what time stamps. At what stamps of time we prefer this English at what times do we prepare this one. So like time based labelling which of the English streams is good.",
            "And then,, after we figure out how to do it ourselves, we can consider what should be the user interface for anybody, like a non-skilled person. And whether the task as such is is doable at all. Or whether it is too much load on the on the human brain.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. And that's -. Like so suppose the main audios the main speaker in, is speaking in French.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we have the interpretation, interpreter in Czech.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I need to get the English MT, from the,, from the Czech interpreter.",
            "Yes.",
            "Otherwise English MT from the French ASR.",
            "Yes, if we have system for that, yes.",
            "And then we need to check which English is better.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Is that, is that what you are talking about. Right?",
            "Yes, exactly. Yeah.",
            "Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, like okay, is it's it's clear now.",
            "So I'm afraid that the Pexip room will, is booked for 2 minutes more only and then it will possibly close.",
            "Okay, okay, yeah, I I I I'm I'm done I'm done. Yeah, okay, okay. So thank you for your time again and yeah. And have a great.",
            "Great, thanks. I'll be in the office in the afternoon from like 3, 4ish till,, probably 7 or 8. Today. But but you don't have to come.",

            "Yeah, okay. So it's just half past nine in LOCATION1. And, I'm wondering whether we should start, or whether we should still wait for ORGANIZATION3.",
            "I've just heard them on e-mail.",
            "Yeah, so I think that we can probably start so that we stick to the schedule. I was curious who is PERSON16. Do we have a new team member or is it just someone's nickname?",
            "Oh, sorry,. Yes, we have a new team member.",
            "Yes, that's good that's great. Welcome. Yeah, I also did - the PERSON11,, is also a new person, for us. He is still remote unfortunately, he cannot come to LOCATION1 due to covid restrictions. But I think that he has probably, applied for visa already if if that was possible. We'll see or - it's difficult to to apply, even apply for a for a visa. So that's that's a good idea to have new team members here, especially today. Okay so, I think that, I'll probably start presenting, so that we test also the, the agenda. We did one change. I'll get to that in in a second. So the the lunch is actually moved a little bit later than what was in the original agenda. It's now already modified in the Google doc. And that's to make the lunch break reasonable a more reasonable in the UK. And it actually also nicely, separates the kind of research work packages from the integration in and other work packages. So it's the the split is also,, good. I'll start with my slides,, and everybody else, would then always get a chance to present their slides. So, we'll be swapping,, the, who is presenting from the presentation for for in the in the Zoom call and later in the Webex call tomorrow. And also,, I've asked, if if there, would be some live demos, and we will see. So PERSON5 is not yet here. I do not know if he comes, at ten. Hopefully, he does. The idea is that, the, starting from work package, on ASR we would have, in the background a subtitling running,, or actually paragraph view would be the recommended one for the whole Zoom call. So that people who are not, following the slides at the moment - who who find the informations that like duplicate that they know that already. They can,, look at the translations of our English into all,, the languages. So that will be,, ideally, if, PERSON2 agrees,, and if PERSON5 comes and sets it up,, that would be like an ongoing demo for the morning sessions. Starting from work package two when people would get the link where to look at that. And then at the lunch break, we would,, stop this. And after the lunch break,, there is the integration work package and as part of that either PERSON24 will show,, the videos. If the demo if the live demo is too risky, or, -",
            "We will actually do one of the shorter life demos that we did already twice or three times in the past. So, so that this would be like interactive,, extension of the presentations.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON6 and PERSON21 just wrote that they will be joining in sixty or ninety minutes.",
            "So we do not have to -",
            "It's probably okay. Exactly, yeah. So I'll now start presenting - share screen,, what do I - now the screen. So hopefully you,, download pdf, you see my screen now, open with Acrobat Reader. Yeah. That's the one. So please interrupt me at any point, or at notes - somewhere, if, but not to the chat preferrably. Because the chat is yeah it's difficult to to execute for to realize that something is in the chat. And also while talking, and that is a warning for tomorrow as well and warning for everybody, while talking the person who is talking is quite unable to, realize that there is something in the chat. So if something terrible is happening,, you have to just step in and say it aloud. Because the person is focused on the presentation, and and doesn't see doesn't get any notifications about,, about that. So,, chat is good only for those who are not presenting at the moment. So welcome,, to,, the review meeting of PROJECT2 and DRY RUN today. I'm PERSON13 and I would like to present the overview of the project, and some summary of the,, managerial tasks,. This is the agenda for the,, whole day today. So, we have thirty minutes block for this overview. I think that maybe we could go faster, we'll see. And then we have, two and half hours,, slot for five five work package presentations. For each work package there be always twenty or twenty five minutes of of presentations, and some time reserved for questions. So hopefully we will, manage, to, to make this timing. Then we have one hour break,, for lunch. And after the lunch we have three more work packages. Two, are on integration, and, on dissemination. These take up thirty minutes again, each. And then we have fourth package on ethics and that is shorter, because it is something which was added on top of the project, later, and, it's - well, well, fifty minutes should be sufficient. We have, some extra time there for additional questions. But as said, I would prefer the questions to be,, mentioned, while we are in the respective work package. And then there'll be the break for,, reviewers and project officer to discuss and then the times slot to, to get the feedback from them. So, ideally,, by four o'clock in the afternoon in LOCATION1 time we should be finished. Here is a summary of,, a research and integration, and innovation goals of PROJECT2. And actually,, a color code what we deem as research,, challenges and what we deem as innovation challenges. So a machine translation, speech translation, are areas that have been examined for decades already. But,, we are moving,, to the highly multilingual,, space,, our main,,, our main exercise, our main use case is,, interpreting life translating spoken language at a ORGANIZATION8. Starting from six or seven source languages and translating into up to fourty three target languages so that's the highly multilingual aspect. We are also focused on improving the document level coherence and document level we mean both for written documents as well as for spoken documents,, in the long term,. Because, cross sentence,, phenomenon, maybe even more important,, for, speech. So,, these are the speech and translation related goals. And we have added one more goal and that goal is highly research. So in highly research we do not,, expect to achieve something that would really work for users. We have a plan to do a demonstrator, but the demonstrator,, would be based on a technology, which is very hard to develop. And that is automatic summarization of meetings, which we call minuting. So,, here in you will hear later on in the meeting summarization. We want to plot the ground for research and start a solid research on on meeting summarization. Provide data of our shared task, and see how far we can get with the technology. But I er, re, er, repeat again, it's it's a very challenging goal. So ORGANIZATION2 is a coordinator. The research partners are ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION14 and we have,, the integrator ORGANIZATION11 and one user partner ORGANIZATION3 within the project. And one more user partner affiliated to the project and that's the. ORGANIZATION12 of the Czech Republic. And main PROJECT2 event was supposed to,, happen in May this year. But it was postponed by one year,, because of Covid and that's the interpretation at the ORGANIZATION5 congress. So here is a summary of achievements in the first,,, reporting period, in the first eighteen months of the project. And you will hear,, the details about the progress in the individual work packages later on. In the goal of integrating ASR and machine translation into spoken language translation we - I'm actually starting with this integration work package because,, now in the achievements, becasue we were researchers,, who were happy with our models,. And independently the ASR was very, good and the machine translation was very good and then when we tried to put them together we realized \"Oh it's not so easy\", the interfacing. Especially when it's supposed to be live subtitling, the interfacing is is not a perfect. Machine translation requires full sentences, while ASR is, producing one word at a time. Or the ASR is even offline, so it produces the,, the transcribed, speech in one shot. So there was big challenge in,, in putting these things together. But we managed in the first half of the project, we got ready and we can now live subtitle sessions, regardless whether they run in person or remotely. And we did a a fair amount of work on on balancing the simultaneity and user experience. More could be done there,, but now we think that we have the set up, which is usable. Obviously, the the final quality,, depends very much on the underlying models. And there is still a lot of work to be done, especially on the speech recognition for non-native speakers,, and also,, machine translation was the, noisy output of ASR. Noisy in various aspects. We'll we'll learn about it in the in the late representations. We ran multiple live presentations and also test sessions, so, so the infrastructure is now,, I would say solid and working very well. Obviously, the the final end user experience can be still pretty bad. It depends on the,, on the actual content of the presentation, and many many aspects of how the speech is - pronounced, delivered,, recorded,, processed. So there there many,, many, fine points that need to be taken care of. And if the conditions are good,, then,, and the domain matches the training data, then the performance is sufficient in our small experience so far. For research in the the, main areas,, speech recognition, machine translation, spoken language translation I would like to hear some key achievement from from ASR so I would like to add something here. I think, that for the machine translation,, yeah, so if if you have something now please put it to the slides, or or mention it.",
            "Well,, what you could do put in for work package too. I guess it would be,, encoder decoder plus attention streaming ASR.",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's actually,, - Maybe there is the third point there, working towards no no - Not yet.",
            "Yeah that's that -",
            "That's that's -",
            "That's that one -",
            "That's.... I see -",
            "Yes, but it's it's achieved.",
            "Yeh. It's achieved. Yeah, yeah yeah. Okay. So we have this streaming ASR and now it's not quite integrated.",
            "Well, it is for English.",
            "It's for English? Okay. That's great. Yeah. So I'll put it there and and please check. For, for machine translation we deployed and improve multilingual models and again you will hear about that at in the presentations. And similarly we worked on document level,, translation and evaluated it in many ways. And also improved, it was a secondary phase. That's the work by ORGANIZATION7. And,, we are working towards,,, integration of fully neural ASR into the, vibrant processing so I just heard today that the English is already integrated. But it has not been yet tested thoroughly in our sessions. And, I have one more question. And that's -",
            "No, it has has been running for quite while.",
            "Now was it? -",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "Shoul -",
            "Did we - did we use it?",
            "Normally it should have been the standard one, for example, for the latest demos also.",
            "Okay, because -",
            "So -",
            "Yeah, we were not aware of that. So.",
            "Because at the PROJECT3 so I mean -",
            "Aha.",
            "We always have both both running. But normally at the PROJECT3 it should have already been the sequence good.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "Well, I I was the one who started it, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "But normally it should have been - I mean, we are now basically since two three months -",
            "More or less running the English neural to neural as standard, so is.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's' cos it is significantly better.",
            "Okay that's, that's very good news,. So let's go back to the research,, the the the the questionaire, we really need the fingerprints to show this.",
            "Because we are now we are now, starting the regular evaluation of, the whole set up. And we are ready to to have many results,, of different versions, but we need to distinguish both versions. So -",
            "Okay.",
            "Should I put in the contact with PERSON8?",
            "So it is PERSON24, and then PERSON5, and PERSON10. They they all designed this or discussed how this should be done.",
            "Okay, we will.",
            "So it's important that, that we know that from, from the outside what is what is running. Yeah. So the the last red point on this slide is the end-to-end spoken language translation. And there the reviewers have explicitly asked us at the last review to, like start doing that. So do we have anything? I I'm I wrote something in my in the in the report, a progress report, where, er, there was the, there was the question, and our responses to that reading and find - I'll check what I wrote there and - Recommendation - technical publications were as that -Start end-to-end tech translation. Sorry sorry start end-to-end speech to tech translation. Maybe taking as a baseline the end-to-end ASR system from work package two. Yeah. So that was a recommendation number three and I s reported on our, experiments,, and and end-to-end SLT under review at EMNLP, right? So - Yeah. So, there is - So if you could summarize in this, like to this presentation in one point. What is our achievement in end-to-end SLT? So PERSON1 - -You may have paper.",
            "Yeah, it's okay so we have - At ORGANIZATION7 we based and one a piece of machine which we hear about next week.",
            "And then there was a master's thesis.",
            "Ehm.Yeah, I don't have to summarize that one one bullet point. I mean, EMNLP paper concerned,, a way of - sparcifying the -",
            "ASR output in order it that give us some quality improvements -",
            "And some -",
            "So it's something we -",
            "To speed up.",
            "Yeah, speed, yeah.",
            "The MSC projects was not a we investigated there the robustness. I'm gonna show slide about that later -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of of the SLT -",
            "Yeah -",
            "As compared ASR.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I will - yeah.",
            "So I'll say working towards and and that -",
            "Yeah, I mean you you can say something a kind of empty, like we have made some improvements in the -",
            "In the end-to-end SLT architecture.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I mean there was another paper from ORGANIZATION14 but is -",
            "Really early in the project and -",
            "It kind of slipped in as an PROJECT2 acknowledgement. I don't know if we should -",
            "Yeah, it highlight it too much.",
            "If we should highlight it too much 'cause it was very early.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to sight any papers here. So -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Was in the work packages mention that and I'll I'll - It's good to know that that you have at least something that's that's very important. Okay -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thank you. So that's, that was they were the achievement in integration and research in ASR machine translation and SLT. And we also have,, achievements in the,, speech, summarization or meeting summarization,. Here,, the achievements are so to say, like baseline setting the the the ground for, for more,. It's very hard to get data from people. It's very difficult to record meetings and to get permissions to, to, to use them in research. We we nevertheless managed to convince ourselves. And by the way, this call is also recorded, which you know, from from our previous calls. I should have said that at the at the beginning, and, we'll be collecting the the consents,, with the, usage of the data soon because we got a new active person now on the on the ethical issues. So she knows what, should be still improved in the consents. And as soon as the consents are, slightly improved, we'll ask you again to the re-approve, what we can do with the data. So anyway, we convinced several fellow projects to provide the data. So it's not just us. It's other,, EU project and I think two Czech projects. And we also got,, an Institute from the City Council of LOCATION1, who are contributing,, their, meetings. So hopefully they, they gave an, approval, and they are giving the data,, to us now. And hopefully they will stick to that, because technically they can decide at any point to to like, prevent us from using the data. But, but we hope to to run the nega negotiation successfully. So we are collecting and analyzating the data. Mainly creating a transcript or fixing, automatic transcripts and, providing summaries where they are not provided. And we also tested some baseline models. So we have kind of complete processing pipeline. And we also tried to short, to to cut it short, to just to sequence the sequence models on that. But the results so far are very poor. So, the research really has to start. And in dissemination we also have some achievements. I'll start with the dissemination towards, the public, or related areas. We are in very close connection with the ORGANIZATION12 of the Czech Republic. And for example, we prepared a complete workshop on NLP technologies for them. And we'll demonstrate that workshop to them as the dry run. This will happen at the ORGANIZATION8. It should have happened already in May, but we'll have to wait for that. And there, thereby we'll get to present not just our technologies, but the whole area to many public institutions, in in one go. So the ORGANIZATION12 is around the Europe,, - and hopefully that will spread also further to other institutions. We're also, in close connection with interpreters, especially the interpreter and student interpreters, at the Faculty of Arts of ORGANIZATION2. But, also we we are occassionally talking, at interpreter conferences, to,,, to like start discussion, and, see how we, how our technologies can help them. And and how our technologies can, s, eee, how to best best organize who who works on what,, across the fields. For scientific dissemination we organize the IWSLT shared task, on,, especially non-native speech translation. That was kind of a baseline run, and we will, do another run of this,. Hopefully in connection with the,, simultaneous translation,, task,, in two thousand and twenty one. And, aside from the papers we also, did some scientific research,, dissemination into research community, at the User and advisory board meeting in August. So,, through individual person links we we hope to, to, get PROJECT2 known in the community. Here is summary of the project in terms of work packages and you are now watching the presentation for work package eight management. And then we'll go over all of the other work packages with the lunch break, after work package on minuting. And there will be one more, short presentation on the ethical issues, which is work package nine. Here is the summary, on management. Everybody's involved, very little, and we as coordinators, have, in total closed to year, over the three years of duration. That accounts for meetings, most of them are remote, and, all the all the reporting, obviously. Here is a very rough summary of deliverables and milestones. All deliverables which were due have been submitted. We had, just a few days, delays with two one or two deliverables. So in total, there are to be thirty two deliverables and twenty are completed. So the first half of the project is like more packed with deliverables, and similarly, for the milestones. There again we have a successfully achieved everything, which we could have achieved, except for the ORGANIZATION5 Congress that was postponed by one year. And again,, in total, there'll be sixteen milestones, and we have completed ten of those. Here is a summary of the financial aspects of the project. All partners reported reasonable spendings, and, some had, some minor deviations from, planned spending. The planned spending is generally, planned proportionally,, and,, s there are no major deviations from the financial plan. ORGANIZATION2 in ORGANIZATION7 spent a little bit less than than a the half, so that's a reserve for possible, unexpected fluctuation in exchange rate as well. And, ORGANIZATION11 spent more, then the half, and that's because,, the integration, is,, needed much more and it was planned to need much more afforts, at the beginning of the project then later on. So you see, the spendings plotted, here in the graph. Overall the project is, roughly at the half or little bit less than half of it's cost. And ORGANIZATION2 and ORGANIZATION7 are are below the half slightly. ORGANIZATION14 is almost perfect. And and ORGANIZATION11 has spent a little bit more and ORGANIZATION3 is also, somewhat under spending. Person months,, activity, here again we we see that in most work packages, well, in total we, are at half, so that's that's good. Some of the work packages, seem to have exhausted their work plan person months available, such as the work package one on data. Here, we actually expect an overspending in person months, not in money,, because a lot of annotation work is done,, by people who are, s-on on lower salaries, and not so,, so no, no high skills are needed for that. So the person months are eaten up faster, than,, than the corresponding money. And, what is this. What is work package six. That's the integration - - That's too bad - So ss, so the problem that I see here, but I don't - I won't say that aloud, that is that the integration is underspent in terms of person months. But we are saying that integration is the main cost of,, of ORGANIZATION11. So, please double check, ORGANIZATION11, double check, the header of work package six. How many person months are from other, partners. It could be that these remaining person months are from other partners, but I actually doubt it. But yes they could be from ORGANIZATION3. So, so get in touch with,, ORGANIZATION3 and and double check like how to explain this. I'll try not to, draw attention to this point. But it could seem as an inconsistency. It can be explained by the different partners,, contributing to this work package, but we need to check, if this holds.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, uh-huh. Okay. Then everythings is like on on track. And to briefly summarize the, the research results. I'm not going to mention all of them now. But, s we are really obviously publishing papers and acknowledge PROJECT2 project. We have to admit that despite the recommendations, the the papers, so far are mainly site specific. So ORGANIZATION2 has eleven papers on machine translation training techniques, test suits and, evaluation,, including the process of of, training, and summarization data. ORGANIZATION7 has seven, papers mai-mainly the document level machine translation, large capacity and efficient neural models. ORGANIZATION14 has ten papers, experiments with Transformer style models for ASR I assume. And also for SLT I'll write it down. So it is fifteen ORGANIZATION14 for ASR plus SLT, yeah?. And we have one join paper. That was an overview paper at workshop on platforms. So we were highlighting the infrastructure of PROJECT2 in that paper. Unfortunatell.",

            "Just one quick info because I've just getting that back. Actually PERSON8 for PROJECT2 has not one deal sequence to sequence ASR model, so -",
            "Okay.",
            "So we can strike for that from the record, we've been just using it internally for our lecture translation sys.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'll tell them that we have to figure out how to get it.",
            "Yeah, yeah exactly. So this is s, for other systems integration. Yeah,, so I'll be very curious to see the, the difference in in in performance then. Okay. And then there is also very short summary of the impact of, the Covid pandemic on our project. No deviations from the plan would have occurred if there were not the pandemic because we'll we'll be otherwise fully on track. Now the most important change is the ORGANIZATION5 Congress been rescheduled, for spring next year. This is still within the lifetime of the project. So that's that's good. But, still we would seek, an extension of the of the project, also, in order to get, time for analyzing the the results of of this ORGANIZATION8 analyzing the the logs and and seeing how the systems performed. Maybe some of the data would be limited,, only for the duration of the project. So, we would like to have more time to to explore that. With no conferences and live life event happening, the showcasing of our demos, and the the dissemination with, paper flyers became harder or a postponed. Also we cancelled one of our meetings,. So these are,,, the the main limitations that we have, suffered now. The the real trouble, is that, is difficult to hire people,, and get them to, to come to a the respective partners. So the hiring process is is very much complicated. And, we are, es l,, persuading hard, or or fighting hard with our personal, departments to to get people employed remotely. But it's not easy. And also remote collaboration is a bit more time demanding, because you need to plan the meetings and and and synchronise, carefully and time zone differences are also sometimes a problem. So it's, the the communication is somewhat slower. So that's, why we will seek for a non-costed extension of the project, by about three months, for mainly for analysis of ORGANIZATION8 results. And, their better exploitation, and also to, cover up, from the,, more complicated communication. So here is the conclusion. So far everything looks well. Submission of deliverables and milestones is almost on time. All partners are aware of their financial situation, and everybody is cooperating very smoothly. Technical problems are there, obviously, but they are working on,, they are being worked on and solved as we get them. And yes, we are publishing papers, but we still need to improve the cross-side collaboration. The pandemic takes the toll of more complicated communication and and hiring, but otherwise it doesn't prevent us from, progress. So, that's that's from me. I'll do this few changes. If you have any other ideas that I should put here, please, let me know. And otherwise,, let's follow the agenda. And let's move on to work package one, right?",
            "Okay. Can you - Can you hear me PERSON13?",
            "Yes, yes. Can you already present? Or do I have to do something?",
            "Okay, let me try.",
            "This would be different in the Webex.",
            "Okay, hopefully you can see -",
            "Yes.",
            "My slide.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, great. Okay, brilliant. Just check I can - scroll through - Okay. Okay, I think we could. Okay, good morning, my name's PERSON8 I'm from the ORGANIZATION7. I'm going to be talking about work package one, which is all about data collection. So, this poor package provides the other work packages with training and test data. And they can use a building systems and for doing their research. As well as using the data directly within the project, we release training data publicly where that's possible. And we also release test sets,, so they can be used by the wider research community. So, here is how the work package is organised. It's led by ORGANIZATION7,, ORGANIZATION2 and ORGANIZATION7 Health majority. It's split into four tasks. And I'm going to talk briefly about each of these tasks. About what we've done so far, and also about some work that's currently in progress. So task one point one is about collecting, and preparing ASR training data and specifically it's about data for Czech. And so the background here is the, start of the project. We already had ASR systems for six of the seven languages, but we didn't have a Czech system. When we go to the project proposal, we'd already identified some sources of transcribed audio data. With the Czech national radio being the main one. So the objective was to collect data and turn it into a form that's useful for training ASR. So for the, national radio data, the recordings, come with high quality transcriptions and were taken from various radio programs. That ranges from, morning news programs to political debates. And the original recordings were suitable for training speech were those just because they are too long, typically twenty to fourty minutes long now is much too long for training acoustic models. So we developed a pipeline and that aligns the audio with the transcripts of the segment level and splits the recordings into much shorter pieces these are about ten to fifteen seconds long. This work has resulted in the creation of two hundred and sixty hours of speech training data. Using that, we were able to successfully train and deploy Czech ASR system. So, a first version was used to the working group on VAT workshop in June last year. Subsequently,, we built built systems using larger volumes of data, including the, systems that are in in production in a subtitling pipeline. So subsequent to the work on the Czech national radio data we've collected over fourteen hundred hours of recordings from the ORGANIZATION15. We could just apply same processing pipeline. So we now have ASR training data as well, and we took the sub-set of this data so about four hundred and fourty hours, which we have released publicly. And the data was described in in our paper that was published earlier this year. In addition, we've created our three Czech ASR test sets. Actually, I think we have a couple more now or -",
            "Yeah.",
            "To check this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So one of those is from, Czech radio. One's from ORGANIZATION15. We also have, recordings from ORGANIZATION10. And we've been using these to evaluate, the Czech Czech ASR system, report some word, some preliminary word error rates here. And was I think we may have better results, so yeah, I 'll check that as well. And of course we're we're actively working on these models. So this task is, now complete. It was scheduled to to run from months one till six. I think it took a little bit longer to get the pipeline running, but yet. It's it's done now. We have training data and test data. And we've been,, yeah actively using them. So, task one point two is about collecting data for speaker and accent adaptation. There are two main aspects to this task. And so the first is that we want to have a kind of full back option for ORGANIZATION8 in case our ASR systems struggle to cope with conditions we have done. Or if they struggle with the speaker's accents being different from the accents that were present in the training data. So our plan is to have re-speakers on an event that will be recorded under controlled conditions. And we know in advance who they are. So we can train speaker-dependent systems. And so that means we need to gather audio data from the re-speakers and adapt to our systems. At the moment we we don't know who the re-speakers will be. And so we will coordinate with ORGANIZATION9 nearer to the the times of the event.",
            "Yeah. So I would more highlight the actual interpreters instead of re-speakers,, because -",
            "Okay.",
            "There is physically less space,, so that the re-speakers probably would not fit in the bullets.",
            "Okay.",
            "The the plan is still one so select the the interpretation agency to get in touch with the interpreters, and, get the interpreters provide some speaker-specific data.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the plan holds just highlight interpreters and not re-speakers.",
            "Okay, fine.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'll make it.",
            "And also maybe the timing of this task. So,, I don't think that we need to ask, for an extension. It's within the work package. But the officially this task is is planned, only for the first half of the project, and obviously it it was delayed due to Covid. So we may mention this, but I would not make it any serious issue.",
            "Sure, okay. Okay, and the second aspect of the task is about collecting data that can help to make a speech recognition system more robust, and especially the dialect and accent. So one source of non native speech data was the Fair of Student Firms, which was held in LOCATION1, last year. And this was an event where high school students gave short presentations about fictitious companies and the presentations had to be given in English. The students were non-native English speakers coming from nine different EU countries. So we recorded, presentations, and we asked the students to transcribe their own recordings. This was part of the competition. So they had an incentive to to do that. We collected a total od thirty nine recordings averaging about ninety seconds in lengths and together with transcriptions. And from this we've created a test set, which can be used to test the robustness of recognition systems. Now this test set turned out to be extremely challenging,, partly because of the the accents of speakers, and also because of some, noisy conditions of the event. So there was some background music and people coming in and. So even, state-of-the art models that are adapted have have high error rates on the status. So it's a really challenging test set. We can try to improve against. This work has been written up. It was published at the international conference on statistical language and speech processing last year. And it's also part of our test set for the IWSLT, twenty twenty shared task. So as a way of testing our own systems, and also staging the state-of-the art we organized shared task on non-native speech translation. And the data set was drawn from five different sources. One was the Antracorp data set. The others, were some publicly available sources, except for one, which was ORGANIZATION9 working group on VAT data of which the speakers gave us permission to use. And that data is within domain and the others are from different domains. For all the sub-sets the source language was English. And there were translations into Czech and German. And the type of translation varied, so for some it was interpreted and for others it was within translation produced from the transcripts.",
            "Actually, if I'm not mistaken everything in the end was written from the transcript.",
            "Oh -",
            "We also have the interpretation, but it was, not -",
            "Oh -",
            "Aligned enough. So it's it's like for for the research to compare the text based translation versus the interpreted translation. And, so it is part of the data, but, for the IWSLT shared task it was I think all text translation.",
            "Okay, I'll update that. Okay, thanks PERSON13. Okay so in PROJECT2 we're trying to support, of a huge number of language pairs. We have seven, source languages, fourty three target languages. And ideally, we are trying,, support every every one of those language pairs and we're also interested in very specific domain and the domain is auditing. Because there isn't ready made in domain parallel corpus covering all those all of the language pairs we'd like. So we can't just go out and download a pre-existing data set. So task one point three is all about, collecting data, for empty ESLT that covers as many of the languages as we possibly can. And that also includes some in-domain data. So one great, resource for machine translation, is OPUS, which is a huge collection of parallel corpora, covering hundreds of language pairs. The data covers a wide range of domains and genres. There are translations of the Bible, subtitles from movies, Parliamentary proceedings, all kinds of things. So we sampled large multilingual parallel corpus,, suitable for training the the initial MT systems in the first version. We sampled up to one million sentence pairs for each language pair using up-sampling tool. The pairs were less data. The corpus have two hundred twenty six million sentence pairs. A variant of this was OPUS one hundred, which covers a more diverse and slightly less Euro-centric sort of languages. We use that for some research, which you will hear about later. And and that is now part of collection itself. We have also been working on an extended data set. So this form the artificial one million sentence pair limit. And and that's now in use for training, IMT systems including some of those the or introduction in a pipeline, and that some of you will see in other recent project images. So OPUS can give us a lot of data, but it's it's out of domain for our application. So for in-domain data we have to go out in crawl and prepare it ourselves. That was another EU project called Paracrawl, which is specifically focused on crawling parallel data from the Web. And we've been, using version of their crawling pipeline for our work. So we started out by collecting data from one of the websites of the ORGANIZATION12 in ORGANIZATION5. And it has given us some monoligual data covering twenty four languages. Some of those languages we're able to collect a lot of data. For others it was less, it was more sparse. On on the average, we got a yield of fourty thousand sentences per language. We're now applying similar approach to extracting parallel corpora from the website of the ORGANIZATION4. And this is a really good resource, because the vast majority of the reports are published in all of the languages of the EU. So far we have extracted corpora for the pairs including English. And that has given us a pretty good yield that on average two hundred and eight thousand sentence pairs per language pair. And we're actively working on, the language pairs that don't include English. So it was more data to come. We have also collected parallel data from a ORGANIZATION13. So ahead of the working group on VAT event we collected slides and other materials from the participants. And we used these to search through a similar sentences from the parallel corpora of ORGANIZATION13. This gave us an in-domain parallel data set, which we split into training and test portions. It covers eight language pairs as German to Czech, as well as certain pairs that have English in the source language. For the initial event we didn't have time to users to adapt our modules, but we have now used it for domain adaptation experiments. But we took models trained on OPUS corpus and fine tuned, using a training portion of the in-domain data. And in those experiments with saw, some strong improvements in fine tuning when evaluating on these, in-domain test sets. So this one is a work in progress, we're building a multi-parallel, multilingual corpus of speeches, transcripts, translations and simultaneous interpretations from ORGANIZATION10 planary sessions. The data cover the years,, two thousand and eight to two thousand eleven, when translations in to all twenty three EU languages were available, at least it was twenty three at the time. I think Croatian's been added since. We received permission to use the interpreters voices for research purposes without we publish it,, but the voices are accessible on the ORGANIZATION10 website. So it that's not a big obstacle to releasing the data. This is data set that can be used in various ways from treatment in ASR, for example, also in simultaneous SLT and multi-source SLT. So far we've downloaded speeches in, the twenty three languages with simultaneous interpretation into Czech, English and German. We're processing over twenty eight thousand speeches, not including the. So it's sixteen hundred speakers over a hundred hours, and a over eight million words of English transcripts or or translations. The distribution of the source languages is is somewhat unequal. So that's two hundred and thirty nine hours of English, hundred and ten of German, and then less for other other languages. Okay, task one point four is about collecting data for minuting, automatic minuting. Its the most challenging task to collect data for, since there're very few pre-existing resources. As a rule we have been collecting and annotating from scratch. So this involves making audio recordings of meetings and and producing transcripts just like in ASR, but also collecting, pre-prepared agendas and meeting minutes, which may have been created by the organizers,, secretaries of the meeting. And then this data, has to be manually annotated by two different annotators with the main idea of the annotation, being that we connect segments of the audio recordings or the ASR transcripts with the corresponding items in the minutes. We've been collecting data from our own meetings as well as meetings for other EU projects and meetings of of other groups at ORGANIZATION2. So far, we've collected approximately a hundred hours of meetings in English, and over fifty hours of meetings in Czech. In the English language meetings, most of the participants are non-native speakers. So this is actually a really challenging data set for ASR as well. This corpus is still under active development. So far, it's been used as a test set for some preliminary experiments on meeting summarization. And we continue into collecting data. Also, we have an open call for data. There's a link to blog posts on the PROJECT2 website. And we're hoping to collect recordings and minutes from, more sources with view to running shared task. Okay, so those are the four tasks make up the, data work package, the data need to project diverse and collect it training test data from wide range of sources. Recent initiative starting earlier this year is PROJECT2 test set. This is a repository where we collect together,, the data, that we use to evaluate our ASR MT and SLT systems. It's a public repository and one of the groups to, adopt our data. So we've spent time making sure everything stored in a consistent convenient format. Consists of mostly Czech, English and German, documents, the, primary languages of the project. But the goal is to represent all of the PROJECT2 languages, using both in-domain and also general recordings and texts. We are coming out of the sixteen hours of original speech and over hundred and fifty original documents. And these either within, or transcribed from audio resources. And most documents are also translated. That's either written translation or live interpretation. So - We are currently working on expanding the data set and providing additional translations and acquiring data traditional languages. And in particular, we using this to evaluate our existing SLT systems. And as they improved we will be able to provide exact measurement of the progress. Okay so to summarize the data work package is on track. We collected data from resources and include direct data that's in-domain through our specialized domain auditing. The data is already in use. So we're using it train models and for evaluation of both our own systems, and the systems of others and for more shared tasks. With the exception of the training data for interpreters at ORGANIZATION5 which we can count until near the time. All of that data collection work is either completed or it's it's on the way. And that's, work is ongoing. In particularly development of the PROJECT2 test sets collection,, the data gathering for automatic minuting as well as of the SLT data from ORGANIZATION10 and plannary sessions. Okay, so that's all for work package one,, thank you. And we have some time for questions.",
            "Great, thanks. So I would like to warn everybody, including myself that we should always think that we have really at most twenty five minutes. I think you you also like to use your time very well. But I know that I have this problem that when I remember, I should be finished by half. I will be finished by half, and that I will actually eat up all the time for questions.",
            "So,, so everybody think about a really delivering shorter presentations than what is the full time slot. But it was good like I I do not think that there will be many questions I think it's it's okay.",
            "Okay, good.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "May I have a question about the edg ethical issues concerning the data?",
            "Oh, okay, yeah.",
            "I just me I think I have missed something because I had missed the PROJECT3 meeting at the end of August. As as you told about collecting the data, for non-native speakers and some else, did you collect something during this year for which you needed to solve some ethical issues, or was it all opened data? So, did you meet somehow these problems with ethics? With consents or something like that.",
            "So I I think this issue would have only risen from the -",
            "Just did you colle.",
            "I'm going -",
            "Did you collect some data from people this year?",
            "This year, I think that would have only been for the for the automatic minuting task.",
            "Now for automatic minuting is what I'm aware of, but something -",
            "Right.",
            "Different.",
            "No, I don't I don't think so this year.",
            "Mm-hmm. So I'm just, I'm a as I will present the ethics today. I'm just afraid to miss something from this year that we have created something but didn't give the consens. So -",
            "No, I don't I don't think there is any issue -",
            "It's, I am happy to hear that, thank you.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "One quick dummy question from my side. So I have seen the repository for the test sets -",
            "Yeah.",
            "For the training data is that also on the or -?",
            "No, on purpose not because even the test set of the ASR files are are often to big. We, never put there anything bigger than a fifty max per file. So the training, you know, are never planned to be there.",
            "So do we have a central repository for the training data? I want to make sure that, my guys -",
            "Are I using all the available data, especially now that we also have to do Czech ASR et cetera.",
            "We do not,, only we have the FTP server that ORGANIZATION11 has provided already at the beginning of the project, but I do not think that we ever used it. We have always shared -",
            "Okay so how - So to make things short. How can we get to all the trainig data?",
            "S yeah to to talk to probably PERSON10 or, I would say PERSON9. But unfortunately, PERSON9 will not be continuing the the work with us. So he he wanted to apply for PhD. He applied. But, in the end he's changing mind, and unfortunately, not not, joining the rest of the project. So PERSON10, and also PERSON7 Polak, like via myself. But, ehs, yeah -",
            "So PERSON10 and PERSON7 have the overview of all the training data that was collected at work package one and how to get that.",
            "For speech, for the Czech speech.",
            "For Czech speech. But I mean -",
            "But we also we also do not have, for example, your German training data. And it's a good idea. I think that we should also try training, the German models. So do we really want to, I think it would be best to put it indeed on the FTP server that everybody, what they have will put that on the FTP server by ORGANIZATION11. Would that make sense for you? Because we we also don't have, your training data.",
            "Yeah, I mean, we have a lot of background training data -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That we cannot easily share.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I mean, we can share all the publicly available data within mostly training on. Ah.",
            "Ted Lion.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, you know, the, ORGANIZATION10 data you sent to.",
            "Those we can share. But we have a couple of internal lectures recorded at ORGANIZATION14 that we cannot share.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah, obviously, so that is that that is a fair point. So, the question is, whether we want to like exchange it after some e-mailing, or whether we really want to put it a to a this a common place.",
            "Well. I'm fine with exchanging it after e-mail as well. I just need to know whom to e-mail to.",
            "Yeah, let's let's -",
            "I don't know-PERSON8, would you be the Central -",
            "PERSON8 is for the text, -",
            "Okay.",
            "And for speech I think would just like, you and us.",
            "Okay, so I'll contact PERSON10. And -",
            "Yeah, that's that's the -",
            "That's PERSON7. I recommend PERSON7 Polak for SLT, it's it's -",
            "So, so PERSON10 -",
            "So PERSON10 PERSON10 could you please send an e-mail to both to PERSON2 and PERSON7.",
            "Yes.",
            "So that they yeah -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And PERSON7's name?",

            "Exchange -",
            "Training, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. And in exchange we, we would like the German and English, data. We're not so, at the moment, we don't have the capacity to try out Italian ourselves. So - So so PERSON10 please tell PERSON7 to, to get also this. So that we have also our own versions for English and, German ASR. And since PERSON7 will have some benefit from this then he surely share the Czech data.",
            "Well, I mean, it is within the project -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you want to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The Czech system -",
            "We we want to get the expertise. So that's why we are trying ourselves. But,, it would be very good to see, how well you can train it, and how well we can train it. So I think this internal competition is is very useful for everybody for both our skills, and also for the final system that we have for the project.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I think it's it's useful to do this like wasteful,, it's wasteful in terms of human resources. But I think it is valuable.",
            "And we still have to think what to do about Russian.",
            "About what? About -",
            "Russian.",
            "About Russian, yes. Oh, yes.",
            "So we have a number of Russian colleagues here, including PERSON20 by the way. But they ee, like don't have any capacity for this. And definitely they do not know about it. And some of them are not on the project. So, I'm just saying that we have Russian speakers around in the team.",
            "Yeah, but we have to look for for all available data sources.",
            "Yeah.That's true.",
            "So I guess it will be an important language as well in order to distinguish ourselves.",
            "Yeah, that's right,. Yeah.",
            "And I guess we need to do some more testing on the PROJECT2 test sets.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "So do y - What what is the status for for ORGANIZATION9 specific test sets? Do we have anything yet that we could try out?",
            "We have the. This was the, somewhere part of the IWSLT test set and, that the right person to supervise this was was PERSON17. But he is available now only for one more week, and then essentially this week, and then who go on vacation. And then he will take a break because of school, but he should be rejoining towards the end of the year, hopefully. So, and and the substitute person, would be, PERSON22 no, PERSON19 another one from our team who are supervising,, the PROJECT2 test set collection. And yes, we are, trying to get get,, the domain specific data there. Some is already there. But for example, we don't have any Russian speech, there yet.",
            "But I mean, in in general, it would be good to if we have been developing the ASR now on whole ORGANIZATION9 of different kind of data.",
            "But we should start to evaluate actually on the ASR -",
            "Yeh, yeah. So please, like be active or ye, you and especially PERSON8 and other colleagues in your team. Be active in criticizing the, PROJECT2 test set and adding any materials that you would like to. Yeah, so PERSON2 if, - Did you hear me?",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Yeah.So. So, ts like f please do contribute to PROJECT2 test set by asking for more or even t providing more, and and we'll put that in. And also,, that try to, debug the PROJECT2 test set by, by using it. So it is this is exactly what what we want. And what was the purpose of the of the PROJECT2 test set to let more people use it easily. And have have a solid way of testing.",
            "Okay. I don't want to. Just one last quick question. Any chance that we could do ORGANIZATION9 test one in IWSLT?",
            "So what exactly do you mean by that? So -",
            "To have an to complete the deaf test that we could use in IWSLT and run it in an online onlinelow latency to see whatever task.",
            "So this boils down to the amount of data. We already have that data in the IWSLT, test set that we created for the last year and -",
            "But that one.",
            "No no no it was it was ORGANIZATION9 that was ORGANIZATION9.",
            "TED ORGANIZATION9?",
            "There is this - No no no. Th, there was ORGANIZATION9 in the ORGANIZATION12. They -",
            "Then you said TED in hours.",
            "Oh, did I say TED?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I. So we we had actually - So that was diverse. Have a look at the PROJECT2 test set, and not the dev set illustrated only one file of the domain. But the test set had more. And if we, like, divide it differently, then we have that.",
            "Okay.",
            "And the the problem is that, the, the amount of data that we got is limited. We we it was difficult to, to get approvement eheh, approvals from,, from that workshop that we that we had. But, let's, keep that in mind. And, since I'm in touch with PERSON3, and, I would really like to have it more on-line. That's why I contacted him. Then it, would be good to add more, to to have a larger test set so -",
            "I'm I'm -",
            "See I'm not sure how ORGANIZATION9 reviews will be. But if I were you these would be the kind of questions I would be asking on the data collection.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So it's there, well, in in the overview paper or in the PROJECT2 test set we know how many words it's, and how many minutes. It's, I think it's written also in work package in in a deliverable in PROJECT2 test set if I'm not mistaken. This is for PERSON8 to double-check.",
            "Yeah. This - Yeah.",
            "Okay. So thanks. And let's move on to the next,, next presentation, right, which is work package two and that's actually PERSON2 you.",
            "Okay. I need to quickly set it up here into presentation mode. That 's not - Okay, so the slides are not one hundred percent finished yet. You'll see one or two gaps that I will need to close till tomorrow. By the way,, PERSON13, is PERSON7 available for questions, if necessary or should I ask -",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON10?",
            "So well I'll, I'll try to get PERSON7 Polak also for the call. He is, I'm I'm sure he is not in LOCATION1. He is in Slovakia at the moment.",
            "Yeah, I mean I don't need him right now. But if a e-mail her -.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.",
            "Okay that's it. Because I might have would like to ask -",
            "Yeah.",
            "To check double check the from putting together.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And make sure that I'm not telling any lies, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or misspresenting anything. Okay, let 'see. So, I will try to give you an an insight into the research that has been going on at the work package two on automatic speech recognition. So the goal of work package two is to develop the, speech recognition systems that are needed in the the,, speech, translation pipeline of the PROJECT2 spoken language translation system. In an order for the ASR systems to be usable within that system they have to meet a couple of different criteria. So they have to, transcribe the speech to text, but they also need to be running in real time. They need to run with low word based latency. That is the time span from a time that the word has spoken till until it is put out. And, of course the test run in acceptable performance and for a diverse set of languages. So currently the languages of interest that we have identified for PROJECT2 are Czech, German, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. And as rough target performances we've set that we want to reach word error rate below fifteen percent. Even better if we could go below ten percent. So at the outset of the project, the state of the-art - Was,, are you still there? Because -",
            "Yes, yes, yes, sorry, sure.",
            "Because somebody took away my Zoom window. Sorry.",
            "Oh. Yeah, we we can hear you.",
            "Okay, good. And you can see the screen still?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, sorry. So we have an, at the outset of the project the state-of-the art was to do our online low latency speech recognition with hybrid / ANN systems that implemented base classifier and consist of an acoustic model that models the class based probability of an audio sequence given foot sequence MP, probability of a work sequence as a language, model. And these systems could run in streaming mode with real time at low latency, and with an acceptable peroformance. So the artificial neural networks of these systems were used for estimating the emission probabilities in a hidden Markov model. And that again was then used to do the acoustic model. While the language model was always realized with ANN language models. At the same time at the onset of the project there was also quite active research in sequence to sequence models that do not do use an base approach. But directly use neural networks to output the optimal most likely word sequence. And there were different competing systems there. So one was based on a neural,, target training function called connectionist temporal classification or CTC short for optimizing neural networks that do exactly that that output either directly carries word sequences, for example, using long, short term memory networks. And there were also, other,, approaches that used an encoder, decoder with attention model that encode an audio signal represented by a feature sequence X into annotation vector and then decode that one into the target se symbol sequence for except the characters or word. That, even though these models gave better performance than the hybrid models, they were not able to run at low latency and, in real in an online streaming mode. So at the beginning of the project, they were not, suitable for our purposes here in PROJECT2. The work package two has a structure of three tasks. The first task aims at improving the robustness, especially in terms of hybrid ASR systems of the acoustic model so that they are more robust to different factors, such as different speakers, dialects, accents, acoustic conditions, but also domains in terms of topics. And for hybrid, the old hybrid systems there were many, techniques to deal with these, but with the new neural methods, there was a need now to to invent methods to develop new methods to become more robust against all these factors. And to do that for the sequence to sequence model this is especially challenging to find new adaptation methods. The second task,, was concerned with adapting the language model, because in the old traditional systems the language model is more or less responsible for being specific to assist a specific domain. So the acoustic model have specifity to the acoustic conditions. While the language model has the specifity to towards the topics that the speech recognition system, is supposed to work on. And, ASR systems the old ones were always best when adapted and tailored to the target domain as closely as possible. And that is often difficult, because for many domains, it's difficult to get a matching training data. For example, for the ORGANIZATION9 domain it can be difficult to obtain the matching training data. So what what here needs to do is we have to learn a Semi-Supervised ur Unsupervised fashion starting from small amounts of subdata and trying to exploit that as much as possible. In order to be able to adapt a,, background language model that has been trained on a more generic corpus. And then the third task is to deal with the fact that in, the traditional way that we train ASR systems usually you have a training phase and the tuning phase. And once the model is, trained and validated it is then sent out into the real world in order to perform in the real system. But the models of the system remain static. That's the old way. But the real world doesn't work that way because,, the domains,, are constantly changing in terms of linguistics. For example, new words and topics are invented, other topics and words are being dropped. But you also see new, speakers, new accents, new dialects et cetera. So the environment in which such system operates constantly changes. And therefore the systems should not stay static, but should continue to lo to learn while they are being deployed. And that's what we want to do in the third task. So with respect to the work package progress. As shown in the deliverable two point one, we have provided the first set of ASR systems that can be used in the, different showcases of PROJECT2. And we have provided speech recognition systems for and there's Czech, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. And we're while doing that we examined different architecture. So the hybrid, / ANN models, then a sequence-to-sequence model, which is more based on encoder decoder plus attention. And then a completely new model which is based on the self attention, which in a machine translation way often is called a transformer based model. And then for robustness we, looked at different kinds of robustness. So we experimented with neural codes for language robustness. We did, developed this new transformer base speech recognition system. We looked at robustness towards domains and, different topics with the encoder, decoder based models. And then we also, looked in two ways of making these decoder encoder based models perform in a streaming mode with a low word based latency. When it comes to the second task, where we looked at the adaptation of the language models, the consortium performed experiments on in Czech for hybrid / ANN systems. And then finally, in order to prepare work for the lifelong learning task. We created the first interface that allows us to collect manual corrections supervisions from users of a speech translation system. And then in the second half of the project we will perform the research on the data that we collect with this, interface in order to be able to learn a lifelong fashion. This is an overview over the different languages that we covered with the ASR development. We've we have / ANN systems and we have encoder decoder based systems, with attention. And so for all languages Czech, English, German, French, Spanish and Italian hybrid system is available. And for English also a first, decoder encoder plus attention based system is now available that meets all the development criteria, and actually outperforms the hybrid, system. The interesting thing of the encoder decoder based attention system is that it runs now in streaming mode. So you remember from the the intermediate review that we wanted to make a decision on whether we are able to do this actually to do a streaming recognition with this sequence to sequence models. And we actually within the first period managed to to achieve that goal, so that we can run now with the latency of two seconds. And the really interesting thing is that we don't see really a degradation in word error rate, if you compare that to the offline system. So the streaming recognition in English is now basically just as good as the offline recognition. And these are not just any numbers. But these are really state-of-the art performance on standard benchmarks. And an English worker is now available and can be deployed. So the the the only thing that we now need to organize is that we have the the, available computational resources to run that in large scale. Because the neural models need graphical processing units TPUs in order to run. With respect to the multilingual re robustness we had experimented with something that we called language, codes neural language codes. And the idea behind that is that you train the language identification system with the bottleneck and the activation at the bottleneck is a code that represents the properties of the language that you put into the language identification system. And now if you put in, er, a language that you haven't seen during training of the LID system, you still get a neural code out of the LID system that captures in the continuous vector space the properties of that languages. And you can use these language codes in order to, condition neural networks in order to better adept themselves in an unsupervised / semi-supervised manner to the language that has being put into the recognition system. And we did some experiments with this in a CTC set up where we use the neural language codes to modulate LSTM networks that were trained in CTC. And the interesting thing is that if you know, multilingual system in the good old days, if you would make several languages together to train a hybrid system, performance would be great. But if you now use modulation with LID on the multilingual system,, you can actually bring it at par with a monolingual system. So just performs as well as a monoligual system. And if we put, some more effort into it and have a,, super network, based on the, Meta Pi network. We can actually get word error rates that are below of the monolingual system. So they the ASR systems are now actually able to learn from, many different languages, and give better performance in one of the languages. When it comes to multi-domain robustness, so robustness to different topics, we, know from the par past that if you have a hybrid system and you train it on a whole of different training data for different domains, and then you test one specific domain, performance might actually degrade. If you like have training data that mismatches your target domain. And our working hypothesis was that what we've een from previous research that neural network based ASR systems are more robust to mixing different styles of training data. And all hypothesis was that with an encoder decoder based ASR system we even can improve over matched training data if we pool also missmatched training data into the system training. So in order to test that hypothesis, we constructed the multi-domain corpus with a total of one thousand six hundred hours of data. And this multi-domain corpus was pooled from publicly available data in English. And it contained read speech, planned speech, spontaneous speech. With respect to topics we had news broadcasts, we had tech talks, we had lectures, we had phone calls. And when it comes to signal, variations, we had telephone speech, and word bent speech in the training data. So these are the different corpora we had in there and with the different hours, number of hours. So you can see that different corpora have different number of hours in their training data. And they cover the whole range of these, different, three different dimensions that I mentioned before. So what our experiment showed, that actually the encoder decoder based model slot very fell from this multi-domain sets. And while hybrid AMM / / ANN models are always best if you train in a single domain condition with a domain adapted language model. With the encoder plus attention based models we can train on this multi-domain car-corpus and get similar, word error rates as the specific hybrid, models. And in order to do that, we use to technique diff, similar to the multilingual experiment that we did before. So instead of having a neural language code we now have sort of a neural domain ID code that we also learn from a bottleneck the, layer from a neural network that tries to identify the domains. And we can now condition our networks by pending this domain with input. And if we do that,, when it comes to in-domain, domain specific testing we get the same word error rate with the hybrid models. And the really nice thing is that if we now test on the domain that we have not seen, before, so out-of domain corpus that we haven't seen during training. These domain conditioned models actually outperform, the hybrid, models. So here's some word error rate numbers that show that we've switched for TED-talks,, read books, audio books, broadcast news. And then Skype calls, the Microsoft spoken language test set as a test sets. The MLST test set is the out-of domain test set. So if we have the domain specific / ANN models, we basically get the same performance if we have domain-specific / ANN with the multi-domain trained encoder decoder. And then if we go to the out-of domain corpus, we see that with the domain conditioning, the encoder decoder is significantly better on the out-of domain corpus than the hybrid ANN / ANN systems. When it comes to the robustness of the acoustic model, there were also experiments performed with a differed ASR architecture. That is a combination of phoneme level acoustic models, so a network that outputs, phonemes. In the experiment there was Jasper used, which is essentially a convolutional neural network, trained to output phonemes using the CTC crit PERSON12. And then on top of this acoustic model, a transformer-based translation system performed translation from phonemes to graphemes. So when this is applied to clean training data, the performance is not really, much worse than that of ey, baseline system. And this, performance can be improved when using, collapted training data. That is most similar to what a acoustic model would put out. And if it is combined with transformer - I will have some more details on the slides, on these experiments. Then we also looked at robustness to data augmentation because for sequence to sequence end-to-end ASR overfitting is still one of the most prominent models. And usually data augmentation is used to counteract that problem. Most common technique is the specAugment which does spectral and temporal masking and we added some additional techniques. For one we added dynamic time stretching,,, with online perturbation in the spectral domain. So instead of speed perturbation in the time domain, we hear by avoiding the shifted pitch. And we also use sub-sequences sampling in order to have more linguistic data augmentation of the output sequences. And when we apply that, we can see that our sequence to sequence models essentially the achieve a word error rate that is, more or less comparable with the best performing systems on switchboard and CallHome. And the best performing switchboard is actually a s combination of five different systems, while we basically reach the same region of word error rate by using one single system. Then, when it comes to the adaptation of the language models that was work performed on Czech. Where a Czech hybrid ASR system that was based on Kaldi was adapted to different domains and the adaptation was done on the language model. So the different domains that were used to the experiments were ORGANIZATION15 speeches from the ORGANIZATION15, c speeches in Czech from the ORGANIZATION10 and presentations on computational linguistics, conferences of the ORGANIZATION12 in LOCATION1 and Czech broadcast news. And in order to do the adaptation different types of adaptation data was collected like slides, papers, newspaper articles and key words that are later to the target domain. And the slides we will also finish futhermore with some results. And then finally, for the lifelong learning we had the preparatory work where we are, implemented this editor that allows to - If the video - would load - I guess I will replace the video with a just a couple of of pictures. So where we were able to, now have multi-user collaborative edits on transcriptions on translations of recordings of, talks. And all different kinds of of spoken language translation sessions. And then we can exploit these edits in order to do a lifelong learning. So what is the outlook for the rest of the project. So we now, aim at coming up with encoding decoding encoder decoder plus attention ASR systems for all languages of PROJECT2 to to be used at the PROJECT2 framework. We will perform experiments in lifelong learning based on the user edits, with ORGANIZATION14 that we got from the ORGANIZATION14 editing platform. And we will do more experiments techniques on robustness towards languages, accents, general conditions et cetera for the end-to-end speech recognition systems. And some of the things that I can also p already promise for the next review, but they don't fall into the reporting period of this this review any more is some first recipes for lifelong learning based on, fine-tuning looking at different aspects of how how to do the fine-tuning. For different things like accents, domains, et cetera and I will also report on being able to reach human performance in English ASR in real time and low latency on a switchboard task. And with that I am open for your questions.",
            "Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. There was, yeah, very good results. The video. I think it would be very useful. But I don't think it is possible to, technically it should be possible to stream it through,, Zoom. But would you,, be able to, to put it somewhere, and like share a link so that people can see -",
            "I can I can also just put a picture in it. I mean it's not that static.",
            "Yes. So maybe yeh. So maybe if you but I would be curious myself,.",
            "Yeah I -",
            "So, share internally and and put a picture into the into the slides that would be the best combination.",
            "I mean the the video on here that's a link to YouTube, so you can just -",
            "Oh, so then then simply put the YouTube Link to the slides. And and and and then maybe picture that's that's ideal. And also, I would like to know more about this. Do we have - No, we don't have the the right person from from our team here. But we have a plan for something which we call censorship, or, the, and the idea is that a live while they system is running. We'll have a module, which would be operated by human, to, to like on the spot fix, serious problems in the pipeline.And maybe your user interface is is the best fit for that is -",
            "We actually we we also have that in there. So you can -",
            "You can also use the interface to do life fixes. At least on the display. So it's not really in the pipeline, but on the display side the interface can also do live fixes.",
            "Can it be integrated with the ORGANIZATION11, platforms?",
            "So it needs to be integrated at, at an earlier levels. So this is all -",
            "Yes.",
            "This is all instrumented at the display level, but you would basically need to put it in somewhere in between the pipeline.",
            "Yes, exactly. So that's like who would be the right person to talk to? And if you would allow for that. I think it would be very useful for the project to to start with your current setup, for this censorship, and integrate it earlier in the pipeline. So that, the other, so that the rest of the pipeline actually, knows how to do this. So -",
            "I will - Oh, that's a good question. So we have a student working on that.",
            "The problem is the student is actually employed at, at the companies of ours.",
            "But we're using it in the ORGANIZATION14 lecture translator. So I cannot take him basically to the PROJECT2 the project to do -",
            "So we would have to find somebody who could look at it. I mean, if you already have somebody, you could also try that.",
            "We don't have s, we only had a plan. And we have one remote person,, who never was able to arrive to LOCATION1 -",
            "Okay.",
            "And and who could get to this now.",
            "Bi.",
            "So if if anything would be sharable - If it's - if it's -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If it's student work. If it's not like a as a closed source, something, which really has to remain close source, or if you could share it within the project, that would a-allow -",
            "The yeah, the-editor so the base editor used actually is an open source editor, so -",
            "So I can look up what editor this is based on.",
            "And I mean, the website itself doesn't help you anyway any anything anyway because it's on the wrong it's at the wrong point in the processing pipeline.",
            "Well the the web-based interafce is not a problem. We can have it earlier in the pipeline and still use some web-based interface so -",
            "Yeah, basically so you can take the this web-based editor and you have to put it somewhere else.",
            "Yeah,, exactly,. But we can u.",
            "But -",
            "We can use it as a web based either, but -",
            "But it is a it is a web-based editor it's sort of a plug-in that was, that you can put into that we put into our website.",
            "I think, maybe there is some some misunderstanding of the thing. The editor is directly integrated with our presentation platform.",
            "Exactly. But you can you can also you know establish the PROJECT2 as a stand alone thing and then integrate it somewhere else -",
            "Yes.",
            "In the pipeline. So I'll - I'll give you a link to the editor. So it is a -",
            "Source projects. And then you need to integrate it into something that you can put into the pipeline.",
            "Yeah, and similarly, ORGANIZATION11 has, an editor, similar like that? PERSON24 was sharing that some time ago. And, so so I think it it would be best, if like, you decide it you two, ORGANIZATION14 and and ORGANIZATION11. What is the easiest, way of of of putting this into the, ORGANIZATION11 pipeline. Either er relying or not on the editor from ORGANIZATION14 or any component of that or the one from PERSON24? So that's -",
            "Oh, well. We have first to discuss, exactly -",
            "Which is the the requirements.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If we need something to edit this subtitle before -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Before publication -",

So please, make us,, make make ts s contact all of us and get us, to discuss these requirements, and the options in two weeks from now at the latest.

            "Yes, yes.",
            "Grey stuff.",
            "Yes.",
            "Oh Hi,, okay, so I'm PERSON1 and I'm presenting the work package three spoken language translation. Okay, so spoken language translation is essentially it's the bit that joins the ASR and MT together. So, it's about how we get, say the noisy output from MT from ASR which is is a spoken style into something resembling subtitles. So essentially, we have two different models for doing this. The first is is the one, we're mainly using in production, which is the pipeline model. Where ca we connect together essentially three different systems. We have an ASR system to make the transcripts. And then we have a componental module which basically ties up the transcript, makes it more suitable for machine translation. And then we have the machine translation component. We've also been invent experimenting with the end-to-end systems where the goal of that is essentially to have one system that takes in the audio and produces the ouput text. So with that sort of split in mind - Yeah. So the way we put together the work package. We thought of that as three different tasks. So the first task is sort of ASR ouput you assume a pipeline system. We take the ASR output and we try to make it more suitable for machine translation. The second task is sort of coming in the other direction, where we take the the machine translation system and try to make it more try to try to make it better cope with ASR output. And third task is way you can edit together, and just try to do things from it in an end to end fashion. So that is just the structure. This talk is based on the zoom through the different bits of research that we've done in this work package. And in terms of their connection with the tasks, what we what we have actually done. This is the way we wrote proposal that there is there is quite a lot of tasks that are connected with this idea of how we take online ASR and first to build an MT system that cope with that. And secondly, try to build on it online SLT system. So we put it that in into three point two, because it is basically about how we convert the MT system to make it deal with the ASR. So with that said - The first first thing to mention is segmentation. So segmentation is the bit - it it's not just segmentation. It's the bit that goes between the ASR and the MT in a life system. And the typical jobs it has to do are things like the normalization, removal of disfluencies, addition of punctuation, dealing with cases and splitting into sentences. So we have essentially two segmenters. They are both roughly speaking sequence-to-sequence models. The reason we have two is that,, we started off with the ORGANIZATION14 segmenter. We found that it was kind of tied to to the ORGANIZATION14's ASR. So at at ORGANIZATION2 we started with an another segmentation effort. Because we're also building, building ASR at ORGANIZATION2. So these are these are fairly simple models, which, use sequence-to-sequence models and some rules to produce more like output. Oh, yeah. So. I mentioned at the start that the ASR's online. So this is an example of the the output of ASR. We basically just co again these updates and the updates to to do one of two things. Either the it's - Well, yeah, the the updates either extend the hypothesis, or they rewrite part of the hypothesis. And you see, you know, if you look at the last update you can get changes to the segmentation. So the ASR is delivered incrementally what we do with the SLT. So when we think about how to develop the SLT, the first one of the first things we thought about is, how do we actually evaluate it. The tradit-traditionally, you know, you evaluate you evaluate MT using BLEU score on sentences. This doesn't quite work for the SLT because you have got other things to think about. And really they fall into three different that the three different things we wish to evaluate. The first thing is the latency. So -, the latency becomes a bit tricky. When you try, let let us think about a system level that we just think of the MT level, you are looking at the delay between receiving that from ASR and producing the translation. So there are questions about how to how to actually evaluate that. I mean how do I actually link the ASR ouput with the translation of that output. And then the second thing, which is maybe not obvious is the idea of a flicker. So if you're if your ASR is rewriting and extending and you're constantly translating, then you your MT will start rewriting and and reordering and so on. So if you just open up you get this flicker with things move around on the screen. So you can measure that using something like edit-distance. And the last thing is also the quality. So it's it's evaluated with, you know, we all know how to evaluate the MT quality. We use one of the automatic metrix. The difficulty with ASR output with all the spoken language is a thing about the segmentation. And then you have this thing - you have got this extending going on. How do we - how do we evaluate that, and what we do is we just evaluate full sentences. So thinking about the evaluation we looked around. And there is not really any good tools to to do this evaluation. So this is something we have been working on. We have this thing called LST sorry SLTF which is an open source evaluation tool. The idea is for it to be like the sacreBLUE of SLT. So, we we have a few different versions of different metrix that have been suggested. It delegates a sacreBLEU for for evaluation of MT. But we have within SLTF we have evaluations of of the latency and flicker along with the different variants. So this was used in IWSLT shared task, this year. Also in the IWSLT shared task we participated as PROJECT2. And this give us the opportunity to to try the different tools that we can creating for doing ASR and MT and connect them together. So we took I think seven different ASR systems, including online ones, and offline ones. And various different combinations of MT systems, and try them all together to choose the best one in a sort of competitive framework. And then submitted is as the PROJECT2 system for this non-native SLT task and not only was it not native speech, but it had an online aspects. And so we had to submit the the time stamps for for our, translation. And these were judged by the SLTF tool. So the conclusions from that task were that non-native speech recognition that's a really hard. So the ASR forms did not form very well, for for many reasons,. So the end the pipeline you know, you are getting BLEU score about five. So it is not really very good. It also fell back into the - Through the task we learn to a bit about the evaluation tool and how it worked to evaluate feedback into it's development. So moving on to - We've been talking about online SLT, so the way we think about this is there's kind of roughly two different methods for doing online SLT. When you've got an online ASR. The first method, which is the one we use in is called the retranslation method. And in this method we we saw the MT is more the more the receiver. So ASR pushes messages to MT. There's two different types of messages. Either the ASR extensive stable region. So it says, oh you know, this transcription I gave you. I'm not gonna change that that is unstable. Or it rewrites the unstable region. So the unstable region is the bit that may change. And it can either ex get extended, or it can get altered. And retranslation approach is really simple. It's just like every time, the ASR updates the unstable region the MT translates. It doesn't retranslate everything. Full sentences are considered complete once are stable so they're they aren't retranslated. But I mean, typically, you can have two to three sentences in the unstable region, and they're constantly get retranslated. The other option is is the streaming option. And this one is sort of CMT as being in control and the MT has two actions. Either it can it can wait for more input from the ASR or it can translate and send to user. This works a bit differently, because it requires some kind of modified inference and some kind of learning. So the MT can learn when to when to retranslate. Sorry when to when to translate and when to wait. So we use retranslation approach 'cause that is really simple. We can use that with that standard MT tool ORGANIZATION14, with a very simple wrapper,. And at the moment, we don't, we consider flicker to be quite bad. Especially if the if the translation isn't very good. Then it has flicker a lot. So the actual current production rate of the ASR stabilized. So a couple of things that we can do to improve the retranslation approach. The first thing is that if the if the MT system doesn't see prefixes as an, incomplete sentences in training. It doesn't do very well. So training that prefixes does help. And the nice thing is you do not have to mess about the aligners to produce the prefix d you just truncate. I'm these in training. Makes it slightly worsen full sentences but it makes it better on prefixes. The other thing we do, which is a simple idea,, from a paper by Arivazhagan is is masking. Where basically you don't, you just mask the last key words of the outputs. You translate, but you don't send the whole translation you mask the last keywords. So that's kind of a blind test meant very simple. But one thing we thought about is can we improve on that? So we improve by doing something called dynamic masking. So if you use a fix mask, you end up with quite a lot of latency. I mean in the fix mask it's is shown in a red dotted line in this graph. So the graph is showing the latency against the, the flicker. And the way we did dynamic mask, is we try to look look at the translation and predict how how stable it is. And we do this by basically extending. So we get the source of the from the ASR and we try different extensions of the source. We just basically predict what the next source word might be. And then try translating them. And if we see lot of instability in those translations, then we use a long mask. And if we don't see much instability. We try try various extensions and use the same thing that we do not alter the mask very much. And that gives us a better latency flicker tradeoff. So that was work we published at AMSA. The next thing is again addressing the latency. Basically latency quality trade-off is - And this is going to the streaming approach. Where we we we exploit a a thing called adaptive computation time, which was reduced introduced a few years ago. And the idea is that worsening code of encoder decoder networks. And the essential idea is the decoder. So you have the encoder, which takes the input and encodes it, but the decoder has basically two options. It can either ponder, so it can wait for more encoder steps. Or it can it can produce output. We showed this working for essentially machine translation on unsegmented ASR output. But our plan is to make this work work for end-to end SLT on completely unsegmented audio. So that don't we can do the segmentation as well in the whole pipeline. Okay. So this is moving on to thinking about,, how do we do with the noise in ASR. So, the noise - Sorry. The re MT can suffer, because is essentially trai a mismatch between training and inference. So the training data is using very clean transcripts or basically clean text. A test time, or or inference time, we are using noisy output of speech recognition. So how do you deal with that? Well, oa one way we've looked at is, to try to model the noise. So the method is basically to run some data through ASR and look at the errors. And then we build a model for creating artificial noise. And artifical noise basically consists of things like adding function words, changing function words, changing verb tenses, pluralizing, depluralizing. And then a bunch of, let's say acoustic confusion trying to find words and sounds like sound like so inject them to the MT training data and retrain. So that gives us a consistent improvement. We did some experiments with English to Chinese. It gives some consistent improvement on the when you're translating ASR output, but not when you're translating gold transcripts, which is what we expect to happen. When looking in more details, it's bit a harder to link that to the to the noise models. So r sort of suspecting that there is also regularization going on when injecting this noise, which may be causing the game. We are not really sure. Related to that is another, piece of work we did where instead of instead of translating directly from the audio. Sorry it - it's like pipeline approach. In the pipeline approach we go from the audio basically to the written text. The graphemes, if you like, to add them to the translation. But what if you go from the audio to the phonemes. So you don't actually go to fill speech represent full writen representation. And then you add them to do the translation. That could help with the robustness. I think it could because you sort - you sort of preserving the different interpretations of those phonemes rather than committing to some written form. And it could definitelly help if you have a that a language s-ah transliteration that may well have help with the entities. We haven't tested that yet. We have some results for English to Czech. And what it showing is that in this second part of the table with the ASR source source when we use phonemes as the intermediate representation we get some improvements. Only at the long, the lower the the larger beam sizes. But we get no real difference when we have got a clean beam and that which is kind of what we expect. So that brings us forward into end-to-end translation. Where yeah, the idea is, the goal is basically have to take the input and then the output audio and produce a direct, translation. So what the advantages of that. I think that the main sort of ideas that is gonna be a much simpler model. You know, we don't have to have to have this complicated deployment pipeline. We can have one model, which does the ASR segmentation the MT. Connected with that is is is the notion that it should improve the coupling. The ASR and the MT should work together, because they train together. And it it gives us should give some more efficient inference and make it and should make it simpler to do this online SLT which we are trying to do. One of the big problems that has end to end SLT faced is the is the lack of end to end data. So basically, you need, say, you need like English audio paired with Czech, translations, and there's limited amount of this. Whereas if you want English audio put if you want to build pipelines system, you have very large amount of English training data. And for a translation sets we have a lot of English to Czech translation. So the the techniques that we're using is things like transfer learning system, kind of pre-training some kind of multitask training. And we have been developing certain architecture improvements, which help with the get over the issue. So on the end to end translation system. One of the claims for end to end translation is this this kind of robustness. So it should be more resistant to noise. So we set out to examine this. So I'm going to explain this this this this graph. We experimented with English to Spanish on end to end translation. And what we did was, we added increasing decreasing noise to the inference data. And that is what the X axis represents. It goes from raw as a no noise to very noisy input. And it shows blue on the Y-axis. And the pairs of lines are showing an end to end system and a pipeline system. So that, for example, the blue solid line and the blue dotted line, both show paired end to end systems and pipeline systems. And the different colours represents the different training conditions, we actually injected the noise during training to try different conditions. What we see from this is, there isn't really any evidence that the end to end system is more robust. Essentially the blue the dotted lines and the solid lines are essentially parallel as far as you can see. So there isn't strong evidence from here that we are getting more robustness. This is this is essentially one one language per one one noise injection. But yeah, we don't see any evidence at the moment. Further work that we've done on end to end translation has come from this idea that speech signals very data sparse. So you, you know, the important parts of containing quite small sections. So how do we exploit this. The idea is to learn feature selector before we learn the translation. Have this work. So the method is as appear in the in the enumeration. We first we train the ASR encoder. That were trained as our system, which includes ASR encoder. And then we have another phase where we learn this feature selector. And feature selector that we use is this is the cell zero drop, which is up,, which encourages sparcity, using this L zero-based objective. And then we trained the SLT with these just with these selected features, instead of using a full output from ASR encoder. And that get rid gets rid an awful lot of the, ASR input and gives us some improvement on Bleu analysis and speed up. Like one, let's say one four percent speed up in an inference time. I'm showing here results of linguistic German. But we actually have pretty similar results across the whole of the massy data sets. So that's where we are. Okay. So, may I'm talking on problems here. We have this we still have this flicker latency trade-off problem. What we've done that these to date to make it useful make it good for users is to remove flicker altogether. That gives a large latency. I I think possibly if that systems were stronger then flicker wouldn't be such a problem. We also find that if if the ASR degrades in the MT MT quality dropped quite rapidly. You know, for example, get per per acoustics and the MTs becomes very poor. But also, we have the wrong segmentation. That makes it very difficult for the MT to cope was very difficult thing for the MT to cope with. Also the - and this connects a bit with work package five. And and also with the the ideal flicker. You you got this notion of cognitive load, if the transcripts are not and the translations are not that good or they're too long and they're flickering, all these things make it very difficult for the user to read.So we're still kind of optimistic that end to end SLT was can adress some of these problems. You know, for example, dealing with un-segmented audio. Coming about online SLT it does not work much better than that so far. And also the notion to try to do to summarization of the same time to make maybe one big model can do everything. Okay.Thank you. That's the end of my presentation.",
            "Great, thanks. So I think it was all clear. I don't have any questions.",
            "It's probably a bit fast, was it?",
            "We started late, and we are a little bit late. I think it's it's okay.",
            "It's okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I wouldn't worry.",
            "I mean, one thing I didn't do maybe is just to link everything back to the tasks. It was more or like -",
            "Yeah, that would be that would be useful.",
            "I don't know. Yeah?",
            "So maybe maybe whenever you start a a new result, just mention -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we put this result primarily into task - And and which task. There would - Yeah.",
            "Yeah?",
            "Maybe you miss an conclusion that we are working well, and we have no deviations from a plan.",
            "Yeah, I think I - my conclusion was about - My conclusion was about problems rather than - yeah. We are doing great, though, let's tell the other staff to do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I had this idea in in one of the the cases when you were talking about the the problems assured that there was SLTF and the five black points in the IWSLT shared task. And there, I would just say that, yes, the the starting position is very bad, but we are optimistic that we can do something about it.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that the final word words remain optimistic.",
            "And yeah -",
            "I mean, there is there is good reason to to think that we can do better.",
            "Yeah, I mean, how good was the data set for that task is that -",
            "It was very hard. It was very very hard, but realistic like if you -",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So one of the, sessions, for example, for the ORGANIZATION9 session that was a meeting where the main speaker was speaking via well remote conferencing tool. So there was unexpected -",
            "Different audio settings. And that can very easily happen in like immediately, if you, if you have to switch to a to a online meeting, instead of -",
            "Yeah.",
            "In personal. So the system should be kind of ready for this setting, obviously was, not to day, not our system. But -",
            "Yeah, I mean, one of the things that PERSON10 had on the slide. I don't think I concluded that was that you know the what we didn't do anything special for the five. It was non-native speech.",
            "That's right, yeah.",
            "There was the development data.",
            "Yeah. We didn't do anything special, that's true. Well, it it highlights the problem. And the problem is very important.",
            "Mm-hm.",
            "So we can use the same data set to evaluate, the further models. So, getting reasonable performance on this would really move us, in overall performance.",
            "Um-hum um-hum.",
            "Yeh, so conclusion, a would be, good and linking to the task would be good. But otherwise think it's it's all -",
            "I mean, what's the best way to linking the tasks? And no wonder that in too much. I could - I think I'm -",
            "Oh I would just put - I I can have a.",
            "Or brackets at the end of the title of each of the starting slides. So whenever you have new topic. Then you would say, at the end of that open brackets some -",
            "Like a wave s-symbol like tilda or or sym in maths. And then ti three point something.",
            "Okay, I add to the titles of the slides. Okay that's straight forward, yeah.",

Yeah, so the current state of baseline models is that we have bilingual models for some high research language pairs and multilingual for the others. And we we use pivoting through English. So we can cover all the languages. And in PROJECT2 IWSLT submission we we compared the this multilingual model and we selected it as as the best candidate for English to German. So actually the gap between multilingual and bilingual for for pivoting is being narrowed by research. And it's possible that in future we don't we won't need bilingual models. And we would and the ORGANIZATION12 will be okay with with multilingual. So the next task is document-level machine translation. It's a research task which is scheduled for the all whole three years of the project. In last year we had we had several publications, but we have already reviewed them so I exlude them. And this year we have we have testsuite on ORGANIZATION12 documents at WMT twenty. It's still under review. And I have to finish this slides in the afternoon. Next next task is Multi-target MT. Again we had some publications last year. And the new publication is improving massively is on improving massively in multilingual machine translation. Because multilingual NMT is convenient, because it has there has to be be only one neural network which serves many languages at ones. And so it's convenient to deploy it. But it can underperform. And the other works investigated increasing capacity and language specific components. But in this work the authors propose random online back translation for improving quality on zero-shot language pairs. They tested it on massive scale on ten thousand language pairs, on OPUS one hundered. And they narrowed the gap on zero-shots compared to pivot-based translation from seven BLEU points to one BLEU. This paper was published at this year ACL. Yeah, then we have PERSON23's thesis. Also this slide has to be finished in the afternoon. The multi-source machine translation has been scheduled for this year. We have just started. We have an initial multi-source experiments. And we observed worse ex performance than one source. Probably on probably because of the data. Therefore, we we're are focusing on preparing the multi-parallel Europen speech and interpretation corpus which was already described by PERSON8 in in work package one. And and the idea is that the original ASR and parallel interpreters ASR may have complementary errors. And therefore we may use Multi-source for quality enhancements of the ASR and translations. And also we may find other applications of of this corpus. And we we plan more work. Yeah, the flexible, multi-lingual machine translation, is scheduled for next year, and it hasn't started yet. But already the multi-target models which we have they are flexible in selection of the target. And they yeah - And they yeah, they can be used with any of of the with any language of the set of of source language, not only with one. So to conclude, this work package. We have the baselines, either bilingual, multilingual and with pivoting we cover all the language directions. And we are ready for a ORGANIZATION5 congress next year. The next next two task are the document-level translation and multi-target research task. In last year we had six publications. This this year we have one published paper and ISL. One is under review. And we have one master thesis. The task on multi-source machine translation has just started and the flexible the task on flexible multilingual machine translation has not started yet as as was proposed. In the plan for so in the end we have no major devations from the plan. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, so this was much shorter. You have like fifteen minutes extra so feel free to provide details on some on some of these, papers. I know that some were not ready yet. But - So was there anything underrepresented f, from our partners? Would would you like anything more highlighted? Or - was this okay? Yeah, I assume it was okay. We will - I'll double check again if if we can provide more details on the ORGANIZATION7 experiment, and I obviously make sure to have our work there for example the thesis by PERSON23 covered well.",
            "Yes, yes definitely.",
            "Yeah, okay, so if there is there no questions and recommendations.. Let's hope that the reviewers won't have too many recommendations, later on.",
            "I mean, I think everything's covered in this. Reputation isn't there - it's just -",
            "Yeah, it is.",
            "Yeah. You know, we could put in more details, but I'm not sure where where the right place to put them in is.",
            "Yeah and you also skipped over some, the works that had been previously reported.",
            "Yes.Yes - it act.",
            "I don't not think I don't think it would hurt to cover that again?",
            "Oh.",
            "Yes, yes exactly. I think it would be good to cover it again. So you have the slides there. Do not assume that the reviewers will remember something from twelve months ago.",
            "Okay.",
            "It's it's an eighteen months review so we should cover actually the work from eighteen months.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "Okay.",
            "So say that, it's okay to mention that we have already presented this in the in the nine month review, but, well because we are covering the whole, eighteen months,, let's repeat it.",
            "Okay.",
            "And that way, I think we can easily get to the, to the needed time.",
            "Yes.",
            "Otherwise you get fifteen mintes of questions.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Okay, so let's move on - Thanks for the other tips and PERSON10 please work on that and we 'll have a look at that later in the afternoon, once you have the all the missing slides ready. And let's move on to the other work package the next one, which is work package five. And that I don't if it will be presented by PERSON12 or PERSON14 how you agreed in last few moments. So whoever is -",
            "It will be presented by PERSON14 finally.",
            "By PERSON14, okay. Yeah. So we have another team member, PERSON14 Sink. She's still located remotely,, and she hopefully she will be able to apply for Czech visa or has come to LOCATION1 to help us with minuting. So PERSON14? Does it work?",
            "Can you hear us well? I can hear something very quiet, but I don't understand.",
            "No, it's far from optimal, but if you can put the microphone closer to your mouth that might help.",
            "Yes.",
            "And also thinking of, the, the connection. So now with Zoom it seems that we are lucky that it works. But tomorrow it will be a different platform, the Webex platform. And I think it would be still good to have a substitute speaker in case you, face like bad connection issues, because that can easily, happen, I'm afraid. So, well, PERSON12 please be ready to to step in, in case, the, the connection, fails from from India.",
            "So, may I'm more audible now? Is is -",
            "Yes, it is it is acceptable.",
            "Is it -",
            "It is acceptable. I'll I'll make it louder for myself, and hopefully we'll understand. So start sharing your screen. If that works. Yes. That is good.",
            "Yes. So, okay. So So OK so. Here I'm going to present minuting module. And, so we we have the, we have the automatic minuting task structure and, so we have the different modules for that. So the input which we have to subtask of the minuting medium. The very first subtask is the segmentation of the minuting transcripts. The text into segments and that would be couple of long sentences. And important thing here is to keep the semantically related phrases, in each segment. And next we have the segment level summarization. It's just kind of the sentence compression process. And the third task is a transcript summarization which is the which is the generation of the overall, minutes of the meeting. And -",
            "Yes -",
            "Here we aim to identify and collect the conclusion and the and the phrases only.",
            "Can I interrupt you? Sorry, is that already on the slide somewhere, because I -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then you're sharing then your screen is is sharing the wrong, the wrong screen so to say. Because I only saw the title slide, and -",
            "Yes.",
            "And the Adobe Acrobat user interface and not the - So if if there should be a slide on this, with listing the tasks and then your talk to that,, but I didn't see the slide. So -",
            "Yeah. So yes, I'm to that slide just now. And, so this is a part which is already covered. And do this is a minuting task structure. We have this segmentation strapped to be sent me to shoot us trying. The task is to split the sentences to segments. And that would be couple of sentences long. And so the main task is to automatically capture the couple of sentences of related phrases in each segment. And then to make this segment level summaries of each segment of the phrases. And then to generate the dialogue summaries for each of the generated phrases. And the last is topic matching. So let me just represent of all of them one by one. And so this is a this is the,, this is a schematically.",
            "S-Sorry, PERSON14 you came very quiet again.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "You were louder earlier.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay. Is it is it better now?",
            "Somewhat better. But it was better, before. And also, make make the presentation full screen. Control el or ef five. Control el is typically. Control el, just click control el.",
            "Just a second.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes that's better.",
            "Yeah, is it am I audible now?",
            "Stil too quiet.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "But it was better, when you were it was closer to the mic.",
            "Is it better now?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes, okay. So, I was describing the minuting module and, so talking about the the systematic view of it. So the very first is the is the input and in the input we have the dialogue transcripts and the empty agenda, which, which is the whole which is a whole minuting transcript and the predefined agenda with its topics. The dialogue transcript is probably messy and in the sense that it comes as an outcome from the ASR module. And there're probably lot of noises into it and so, we do we probably clean that first. And so the predefined agenda is the list of topics that are discussed and it may happen that certain topics of the agenda are not discussed at all. And other topics enlisted in the agenda may - may also be discussed and present in the transcript. So we have to be prepared in all the cases. And so the the input is containing this dialogue transcript and empty agenda, and as similar to that output we have the dialogue minutes and the and the filled agenda which is, which is the ASR output. And the primary objective is the, is the minutes after entire transcript. So we want to have the filled agenda with the minutes as with the minute sentences matched to the corresponding agenda topics. And so, so the shot cutting scheme, which we have used there. So instead of the the text segmentation - So because when we get the out when we get the output from the dialogue transcripts from the ASR module, we, we have all the we have to pre-process that data.So we, we will be needing that all the removing all unnecessary staff in tokenization and all that. So, what we have, what we have done is, we have shortcut, the the scheme, and we have print the dialogue transcript we have directly moduled dialogue summarisation by, taking, the transfer learning approach using that transforming model trained with the CNN and Daily media samples. And tested that on AMIT data set that we adapted. And, of course, the results were terrible that we had very low Roche score and, also very messy summaries. But, then here so, I will I will share the results at the end of this. And so the the minuting module, which is it the first module, which is the text segmentation. Here we have the first subtask text segmentation of the whole transcript. Before we start with the segmentation we actually perform the text cleaning steps like tokenization removal of messy. The goal is actually to the braking this spoken language text into segments, which are couple of consecutive, sentences. And, of course we have to take care of grammatical correctness of the produced segments. So we need an intelligent solution that resolves the grammatical correctness along with removing all the unnecessary elements from it, from the transcript. And,, the second module is segment summarization. And,, the - in segment summarization, we took the segments of the summarized of the summarized phrases. And this is technically sentence compression. Eventhough we we have several several sentences in each cluster and then we performed this dialogue summarization where we have one,, one s one approach without the DNNs. And one we have with DNNs with the transformed model. So this is the, pilot experiment which was performed with the extracted summarization approach. So we had, manual meeting minutes we pre-processed it. So all of the words in the minute minutes were tagged with the part of speech. And those were tokenized. And they were TDID scores. But only for the nouns and words. And then we are using using all those TDID scores there were, sentence scores so all the all the word scores we combined with the sentences scores. And the most important sentence were chosen based on the information retention of the summari-summarization we need. And,, that's how we got the summarize minutes. And these were the results from that meeting, so from the experiment we did. So, this is a meeting minutes from PROJECT1 project. And this is the this is the candidate summary. So we had this,, as an output, which is, which is really not good. \"When ORGANIZATION1 I went on ORGANIZATION1\" This is not making any sense too. But this is the output from the extracted summarization. And, this is the reference summary ORGANIZATION1 people capacity, which is fifteen people. And this is a Rouge score for the ef and the pricism and the recall. And, the summary is Rouge which is zero point zero for and the pricism be zero point one. And the recall to be zero point three two. And the BLEU score came up to be seventy point four percent. And so probably by these extracted results we we adopted the extractive summarization approach, where we used the transformer model and transformer model to grade the results. And, I have the results that as well, for the transformer model. So these're the results for the transformer model. And, this is the this is ROUGE score for it. And this is the reference sentence we had from the from the transformer model. The remote will only control televisions and, this is a candidate. So this is the generated summary. And if you can see this, there's similarity between the reference and candidate is, is is, is a little but not, making that made sense. Because the sense is not captured. And so this is the, these these are our initial attempts for the for the the the dialogue summarization. But when we talk about the experiment. So we're realized that the extracted approach is not, generating summaries for, for the minutes, meeting minutes. Because if - when you when you talk about, meeting minutes,, we have aligned sentences lik \"yeah\" \"okay\". And so there were a lot of sentences like that, and when you when you summarized that you get, so many words, which which which are, irrelevant to the to the summarize results. And, so probably I think we'll be able to achieve more good scores. And more semantically, sensible is summarized summarize results, as candidate summary. And, so the the so we her we or - here at the dialogue summarization right now. And then we are gonna do this agenda completion which is going to have the the filled agendas along with the dialogue minutes. Which will be compiled with the dialogue minutes.So the agendas will be the first will be agenda to fill up the agenda the and then to compile those minutes with the agenda. And, then we have this work on the similarity of minutes. So given to two minutes we have to we have to see that whether the both minutes are from the same meeting or they both are from the different meetings. So we we did some testing on, this Jacquard similarity which gave us a a score of seventy point two. And then there was minutes from different meeting, which was sixty three point five. And then we have this CountVec Cosine similarity which was seventy two point six and the minutes from different meeting point, three point seven. And we also tested it for the other word embedings along with Cosine similarities different word embeddings. So,, but when you when you manually see those minutes generated by two different annotators. They are probably, they are probably not, same. And, so, we are actually developing designing and developing deep neural network framework for the similarity measures to capture the semantic sense of the summarized meetings. Ee, so I would and the next plan is to, is is is is for the shared task in two thousand and twenty one. And, we have PERSON11 for that. And I would like to invite PERSON11 to share his his plans for for the shared task. PERSON11 are you there? Can you -? Can you sha.",
            "Hi, hi. Can you, can you hear?",
            "Yes. Yes, yes we can hear you.",
            "Okay. So, hi everyone. This is PERSON11. So, we're, so the final goal of this particular is to organise the shared task in two thousand twenty one. So, we are just on the planning phase for the first shared task on automatic minuting. And we have checked out some potential venues where we could propose this. One is that Interspeech which would be proposal deadline will be some time in November. And there is SIGDail and followed by the IEEE workshop. So as as we already discussed that we have on mostly a hundred of news data. And data for the transcripts and the minutes. And there are a few other works that we can figure to decide on the evaluation measures of the submissions both manual and automatic. Followed by prepairing for the call for submissions, internal systems runs, evaluation scripts and setting up of the submission portal. So can we go to a next slide?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so this is just the the initial shared task that we have in our mind. So the task A is to like identify if the minute is from the given transcript when only the transcript and minute is given. The task B is like if two minutes are corresponding to the same meeting if we have just two minutes as an input. And the task C is definitely the core task, that we generate the meeting minutes from the transcript from. And, finally we have the task D where are given the transcript and a set of pre-defined agenda items and we automatically slot fill the agendas with the minutes. So it's not necessary that we propose all these tasks in IEEE venue. But this is what we have started to work at. Yes, that's it from me. Thank you.",
            "So this is a -",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Is the the end or -",
            "So do we - Yes, so j do we we would like to invite some questions -",
            "Yeah. So thank you for the presentation. I'll I'll send you an e-mail with, like multiple comments on that.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think what is very important is to add structure to the presentation itself. So -",
            "You wer,, th I'll I'll tell you what what has to be there.",
            "So there is one thing, which is the formal division into the shared into the tasks.",
            "Yes.",
            "The structure of the work package from the formal point of view in relation to the description of work that we have to fulfill.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then there is the schema, with the the highlighting that, essentially matches that. But still, it's a different view. It's already looking at the task of summarization. Then you have the results, of individual, experiments. And, the the the reader has to or the the audience first has to have an overview of, the the whole procedure. And then I would suggest walking through that,, again,, and and providing the detailed results. And then there is this, shared task, proposal as, another separate topic of the presentation. And what is also very important is to add a conclusion slide where you will simply repeat that the task is hard. We have s data and and more data is obviously coming. We have baselines but the baselines are very bad. And w like we have multiple ideas what to do more and we are soliciting other people's participation, into this through the shared task. So the conclusion is is necessary. In general, we are on track. That has to be said. And that th like documented. But it yeah, but we need to highlight that the task is hard and and how we are doing that. So, there was the main problem that I had with following you, because, the the or the s order of the slide was not very like clean for someone who doesn't know it. So I don't know if other colleagues, from the project who are not involved in that could could follow. And, other than that, I'm a slightly concerned about the network connection. But there's nothing that we can do about this. It worked well, there were some little lacks, but it would be good if both you and PERSON11 could be able to present both parts. So that we do -, so that we have you as as backup of each other instead of like having two points of failure -",
            "From the network point of view. So please both of you c be in touch, for the rest of the day, and both of you practice presenting both parts. And hopefully it will it will not be necessary. But still, it's you're in two different places in India. So it's risky.",
            "Yes, sure PERSON13.",
            "And otherwise, I'm very happy to see the first results there. I'll we we will go I will be revise with you and will somehow polish a little bit those, the the just the presentation of like, what will the slides look like. But it's good to to show this, and, what else? There is, this summary of the work package which also mentions how many person months are expected, or planned for various partners in the, in the project. It's not necessary to, to show this, but other work packages have shown this. And I would like to ask,, if, other,, colleagues, would would like to have that presented or not. So I'm just looking that up work package five. It's eight months of ORGANIZATION7 and six months of ORGANIZATION14. So ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION14. Do you have any plans anything that that is worth mentioning here? We have twenty seven person months in this work package. So, would you prefer this summary table, to be skipped,, as it was now, or would you would you b suggest to to have it listed and would you have any related work of yours now?",
            "So you suggest that we skip it in order to not highlight the fact -",
            "Yes, yes,",
            "You're only reporting uni work.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, that seems like reasonable idea.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Also I didn 'have such a slide in my presentation.",
            "Exactly, it's not it's not required.",
            "Just did not seem very interesting.",
            "Yes.",
            "But maybe it's just useful administrative thing. But -",
            "Sometimes it helps -",
            "The reviewers -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sometimes it helps.",
            "Yeah, sometimes it helps. So it is important - Sometimes it is it is useful to to divide the work, and and like announce it, how it was devided. But sometimes it's not important. And in your case it was not important. In our case is actually helpful, not to show it.",
            "Okay. I mean, the reviewers have that information.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's not -",
            "Exactly.",
            "That interesting to show.",
            "So it's also fine for me this way. And I also cannot present any complete plans right now -",
            "We always want to do something in automatic minuting, but we first need to find somebody to do it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I mean, with the six person months I believe mean, you cannot do really much innovation.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "We are thinking you know, we're thinking along the lines of having some student project supervise.",
            "Yes, yes so I think that the shared task set up that we like proposed in, now and we have been thinking about this for a for a few months already, makes it ideal for like small scale contributions. So please be in close touch with PERSON11."

            "Any, any time. PERSON3 that time I could not reply you because we had that board meetings. So the, the same day you, you did,, mail me and so I was not able to respond to you. I'm really sorry for that. But, -",
            "No problem.",
            "But,, whenever you find time, anytime, I'm available anytime you say. I, I will be there.",
            "Okay. Okay, so I, I'll tell you.",
            "Yea. You mail me, I'll, I'll be there. For the meeting.",
            "Okay, okay, thank you.",
            "Okay. So PERSON6 I have a few questions. So, let us just be on the same page regarding the annotation. So first we have the ASR right? From the -",
            "Yes.",
            "Video meetings. Right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Then, then we create the reference summary.",
            "Then we correct the ASR.",
            "Okay. And these are the files that you can find in the data with MAN. M-A-N. This is manual. So the files named: first date, then, no, no. First the word \"transcript\", then M-A-and - it means that manual it means that manual transcript and it means that it is manually corrected ASR. So the ASR outputs are mostly very bad. So you can't use them for, to understand what the meeting was about.",
            "Right.",
            "So if you look at the output. If you look at the ASR and the file name which contains ASR in the name you can just see that it is senseless. And that these MAN are corrected, yes.",
            "Okay. So we have that ASR first,, from the, from the minute,, from the meetings. Then we correct the ASR. That is a manually corrected ASR. Ad then,, the reference summaries are created from the manually corrected ASR.",
            "Yes.",
            "So who creates this reference?",
            "So the annotators worked in such way that they have got,, they had a video or audio file and they corrected the transcript according to that. And then they created this summary.",
            "So PERSON6 we have, always we have 2 annotators for, e annotating each minute?",
            "Not always. Not always. This is reflected in the table you have access to. So if you look at the table there is a colon, twice transcript or twice minutes. And if there is \"1\" in the colon it means that it is really doubled. That we have double annotation. And if it doesn't have \"1\", if it has \"0\" it means that we don't have -",
            "I'm sorry. Which, which table are you referring to PERSON6?",
            "PROJECT1 minuting annotation. PROJECT1 minuting annotation. I, I have, I gave the link here to the chat. If you look at the ORGANIZATION2 chat today.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "And click on the table, you will be inside.",
            "Okay. Thank you.",
            "Okay, so,, then we have the reference summary, which we refer to as the gold standard summary that are generated by human annotators. Right?",
            "Uuf, yes. Ac. Well, so why I'm so kind of unsure. Because annotators are humans, mostly students, not always from the computer linguistic fields so creating the summary is quite subjective and sophisticated task and the summaries that are created by different annotators, when I look at them with my eyes, are very often not very similar. So they are gold annotations. But if two people make the same they are never the same.",
            "Okay. So for each manually corrected ASR. So sometimes we have 1 reference summary and sometimes we have more. Is that correct?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay. So,, so now -",
            "So they are,, so we are getting new and new every day. So I work with more than 10 annotators and they gave me back the text. So this is the working,, flow.",
            "Okay.",
            "Progress.",
            "So I will also, so after generating the reference summary what is the next task?",
            "The next task is alignment of transcript with the summary. And this is what we spoke with PERSON4 now. This is the tool that is created by a PERSON1 and should be implemented somehow from the organizational point of view. What we asked you to help ou us with. So -",
            "So PERSON6? The one's which we have -",
            "Just a moment. I have shared the link to this guide to this tool. The annotation instruc the installation instruction and annotation guidelines and PERSON7 if you please look at it and then just think how to share the data and contact PERSON1 and, to,, to start it. So this are some technical problems. Not tech technical issues with GitHub that I cannot launch myself, I sh I need some technical help with that.",
            "So you want this annotation tool to be like kind of web based kind of thing?",
            "Kind of -",
            "Well, GitHub.",
            "It is already, it is already I think.",
            "It is already written. I needed, I need to implement the system how to share the data. How the annotators get the files,, so,, there is some idea how to do the it. And PERSON1 has written it already. I will forward to you. But it was written Slovak so I have it to translate it into Czech. So,, so there is the idea how to implement it the - But we should implement it. So that I can start to use it.",
            "So PERSON6, one thing that, the present data, which we have, it's, it is already aligned with the, with the agenda right?",
            "No.",
            "It is not?",
            "No. We have summaries and we have transcripts. They are not aligned to each other.",
            "Okay. So all the data needs to be aligned.",
            "Yes,,, lines in the minutes are on not aligned to pieces of transcripts. This is what is not done yet. This is, so we have the tool for that. But we don't, we didn't do it yet.",
            "Okay. So we need to align,, the reference summaries to the original meetings.",
            "Yes. Yes. No. No, no, no, no. We have to align,, lines in the summary do transcript, to manual transcript.",
            "Yea, that means, yeah, yeah. I did understood the correct version I think.",
            "What?",
            "Yes, I did understood the correct version I think.",
            "Okay.",
            "So is, so it is just alignment between the ASR and the reference summary.",
            "Not ASR, the manually corrected one.",
            "Yea, that's, that's actually an ASR.",
            "After the ASR output, after the ASR output we manually correct that. So that's -",
            "Yeah. But eventually that's an ASR right?",
            "We don't have any alignment -",
            "PERSON6,. PERSON6 I think better to make a documentation of it. So that -",
            "What we have and what we haven't?",
            "What we have, what we haven't and we e what you need from us.",
            "So this is what I actually deed. This is what you have in the document named,, that one. This example. Yours. That I sent to you, you always refer to. That on. Just moment. I will find it. Qualitative analysis of meeting minutes.",
            "Qualitative analysis?",
            "Yes.",

            "I think yes, we just,, solve this technical details. We are -",
            "Okay. To see you, but really it -",

            "It was nice to see you PERSON3. Always.",

            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye. So I have,, sent the link to qualitative analysis again. And if I look at it,, this is what is given. So is, this is actually what we have.",
            "You are referring to qualitative analysis document, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So,, then,, but there we just have one example, which is, which are steps how we create the entire data, right?",
            "Which example? No I just, in that qualitative analysis document. I mean, the piece given, given is what we have.",
            "So what we need to do is,, is to make alignment of the manually corrected transcript with the reference by annotator A and annotator B.",
            "Yes. Not, we, well actually not really you but annotate might -",
            "Yea, yea annotator.",
            "With some technical helps of PERSON7.",
            "So,, PERSON6 can you just explain this one? Like,, like example one. So first is the ASR transcript and then there is a manually corrected transcript and then there is original minutes. So do you mean the original minutes by the reference summary?",
            "Well no I actually, I did,,, so do I have it now. So for some minutes we, so from some meetings we also have original agendas. Not generated by annotators but real. Like the one we have now. So I will, I, I will extend this part with a, the descriptions of the data. So I will extend the description of the data. Now. And I will send it to you. Yes I, I, we have to do it, maybe in the, if you are okay with that I will extend in this qualitative analysis document.",
            "Yes please.",
            "Yes.",
            "I think you will have to -",
            "So -",
            "Because we have full minutes -",
            "Good to me as well.",
            "Because actually we, I have everything here but without the names of the files. Minutes to these meetings. We have original minutes completed by meeting organiser or secretary. This is what is what is marked in the files by \"ORIG\". ORIG. The name of the file.",
            "So where are you typing PERSON6?",
            "Yea, yea, in this -",
            "In the qualitative analysis document.",
            "And additionally created minutes by the annotators twice for some of the meetings and this has \"GENER\" in the name of the file.",
            "So you mean B and E like, generated, minuted by annotator A and annotator B are the reference summary. Is that correct?",
            "Annotator on A and annotator B are all generated summaries. This is, this \"GENER\".",
            "So where is the reference summary? Which one should we concern that -",
            "Okay, maybe I don't understand something. What is reference summary?",
            "So, I can see when mentioning like that manually corrected ASR to reference summary alignment. So what does that mean? So which one is the reference summary.",
            "Once more. What is reference summary? I didn't get it. Re what -",
            "So we, so we were talking meeting about something called reference summary and candidate summary right? So which one is the reference summary.",
            "Ahaa, okay. You're speaking about experiments. This is what we should decide. So we have just 2 different summaries, both of them are generated by, people, both of them have the same quality. And,, I think it's on us actually to decide what should be reference and what should be candidate. Doesn't -",
            "Right. Yes.",
            "These are just -",
            "So candidate is something which is autom. Checking my connection. So candidate is something which is originated from automatic minuting. We don't have anything from automatic minuting in my example. So,.",

            "Everything that i say now -",
            "So in, because,",
            "Automated is kind of goal.",
            "PERSON7,, PERSON7 is referring to candidate and reference. So reference once, one though by annotators and the candidate.",
            "Yea okay. So the, all, all my data is reference summary.",
            "Automatically.",
            "Are reference summaries. So we have a in I -",
            "Yes.",
            "Ideally i have 3 variants of references. One of them is original minutes that is generated by the secretary or meeting organizer and 2 other reference summaries are generated by different annotators,, and both of them have kind of the same value and I never know which of them is more reference which of them is better. I actually can't even say if,, files with \"GENER\" which are generated by annotators are better or worse than original minutes. Because it's also, it also depends on their meeting and on,, the annotator and so on. Sometimes,, the meeting organizer makes good agenda and it,,, it could be used as a gold data, but an a on the other hand sometimes they just write one line that we disgui discuss,, the book. And so the original agenda just contains one line, we discuss a book. And,, the generated,, summaries contain two pages of different detailed descriptions on which chapters is currently, has been currently described.",
            "So. Okay. So, I think now,, we are picking up consensus that we have the manually corrected transcript and then we have the summaries generated by humans. So the thing is that, why we do so? Because we ne really need to have something as a gold standard. While we done our task. So, this is also I guess one of the,, 5 minute transcript that which one to consider as the gold standard summary. Because if we have multiple summaries,, at least one you should have against which all the other task, or all the generated,, automatically generated minute has to be compared.",
            "So we made,, more than one,, minutes, because this is a very subjective test for, and we did it for the analysis. So just really to get the information which it just have a few of them that are double. Most of them are just single. And,,,, yes, and, we did it double to see how different they are and maybe to search some, something common between them,, and to f, s, to fi, so this is for different task, not for shared task. For shared task we should really have just one gal, gal, galf.",
            "Right.",
            "I understand, yes. But if we want to think what minutes are really good, what minutes, what,, what, is, what is in common between this, so when somebody summarizes the meeting. We should have more variants. So this. And maybe it may, it may also come,, interest when real can follow the evaluation on the alignment, as we spoke about it now with PERSON4. So this is kind of different task yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So the thing is that if we have too much variation between the human generated reference summary, then it will be hard to establish our dataset as a gold standard one.",
            "Yes, yes, beca.",
            "And maybe it would be silver or gold standard. Yeah.",
            "Yes, the variation is really great. It's really extremely very, very big. PERSON2 I think you have seen that.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So you actually -",
            "Saw experiments as well. It, it's the same.",
            "Yes.",
            "And even if you manually look at them, they are different.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But,",
            "So this thing.",
            "PERSON7, PERSON7 we,, we have gold standard as our reference summary by annotators. That's the best quality we have. From our data I guess.",
            "No we, we, we can't call it gold standard and, th and this seen that has really passed some,, test measures. Because,, you see, like,, gold standard is something where multiple people will agree, but here we see that, that the, that the minutes that have been generated by different people are hugely vary. So call it the gold standard would be too early, but,, we need to see.",
            "I'm saying that this is the best quality we have. The one which is generated by annotators. This is the best quality we have. So if one want to compare anything.",
            "So which -",
            "You, we have -",
            "So if we have 2 minutes which one we will consider as the best? For the same meeting.",
            "That's what is something which I'm working on right now.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "PERSON6 did went?",
            "I don't know. Yeah. Maybe she is not here.",
            "Yeah. So this is something I was saying that we ca, I wasn't as a gold standard but this is I think the best quality we have in our dataset.",
            "Yeah. Yeah we have to -",
            "The one which is referenced. So they're not. Yeah so not all of them are by 2 annotators. Only some of them are by 2 annotators.",
            "Yeah. So -",
            "But that's a good thing. But that's a good thing to have, that.",
            "My only worry is that when we release the data with the shared task, how qualitative, how we can establish the quality of that. That is an important thing. Otherwise, like, people will not move that far with us.",
            "Yes. So what do you think what we can do for that?",
            "So, Yeah. So PERSON6 I will just discussing, we were just discussing -",
            "What we can do for that.",
            "That. Hello PERSON6 are you there?",
            "I think she is connecting right now. What are you suggesting what we can do for preparing the data for the shared task? How can you prepare the data for the shared task?",
            "The thing is that,, if we, if we just did only 1 minute and say that this is the minute from this given, given thing. So we need to think of ways to convince the community that this minute is to some extent reflecting whatever is there in the task. So manual evaluation of the generated meeting is important that's what -",
            "That will be -",
            "Like. Yeah go ahead.",
            "So okay. This will, this will help us to manual evaluation framework will help us to make it gold standard. I didn't even thought of this point. This is really good point.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Manual evaluation of,, manual meetings you mean?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Manual evaluation of manual meetings will -",
            "And also,, PERSON6. Yes.",
            "Will help us to say that, okay so this has made some annotation standard and maybe we can call it the gold standard or silver standard dataset. Because eventually we are going to, we have to like,, share the data with our participants. Another thing PERSON6 i want know from you. So, while we organise the shared task we have to like, wherever will be our participants we have to share the data with them. So what are you thinking about the ethical considerations for the, to share the data. Yeah.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Because you, you do a shared task, you have to make your data available, like.",
            "You mean,, so which data you mean? Should we also provide,, audio files only chats?",
            "No, no. Only the transcript and the, and the, and the manually corrected AS the manually corrected -",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Only the manually corrected ASR and the reference summary and the gold standard scores that we generate. We say that okay these are the gold standard scores for each of these minutes. So this 3 data have to release. Yeah.",
            "Yes. Well,, this is, well i,, this is not solved definitely yet because we have some ethical forms given to participants that,, some of the somebody, so for, for some data we have signed the consent that agree with the open use of the data. For some data we have kind of oral confirmation that it is okay and so that we are kind of sure that people will sign us,, the pa the consent with use of the data. For some,, for some of Czech, of this Czech data I, I will go to them next week and we will also thing is, speak about. So this is kind of, work in progress too and. But, actually,, how,, happily we, most of our data comes from PROJECT1 meeting and PROJECT1 meeting are us, so we are, we agree to -",
            "Yes, but,, but I need a, so this is an important part of the proposal. That we have to specifically mention that we have obtained consent from the multiple parties in the meeting to release the data to the shared task participants.",
            "So this is one -",
            "And up to when it should be ready.",
            "Up to, up to the proposal deadline. So maybe sometime in November we should have the agreement signed from all -",
            "All of the agreements.",
            "From all of the participants.",
            "Should they be signed on the paper so we have ORGANIZATION1 forms signed at the moment?",
            "I think, I think like consent over ORGANIZATION1 form, or maybe, maybe you can just prepare, electronic doc, maybe in some PDF.",
            "And, it shouldn should it be explicitly stated that, the data can be used for the shared task.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That they have to agree to that. That should be explicitly specified in that ethical form that we are going to launch the shared task.",
            "So there should be a special, a, a special form actually. So we should find all the people and they should sign that they are not -",
            "And we have to anonymize the data. So suppose like we are talking. So,, if PERSON4 and PERSON6 and PERSON2. So it should be like participant 1, participant 2, participant 3.",
            "So we have to release that, the data in this form. So there -",
            "Should, there should be anonymity and that clause, maybe before,, before,, sending the ethical document to the, to the parties import we may have to show them a doc where there is the, where there is a transcript with the name of the participant and the anonymized version of the transcript. So if they are okay with the anonymized version to release to the public, or to the participant for our shared task. So this is one, -",
            "Woa, sh what shou we should show what to him?",
            "So maybe,, maybe,, y we, oh, while you send the, send the ethical consideration form of their consent that their data should be released, you can show a snippet that, well you name won't appear in the meeting, you will be anonymized as participant 1 or participant 2, we just -",
            "So the this information just to put it into the consent?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Another thing,, another thing I should mention that so in, in the, in the automatic transcript many a times,, we, like, we mention the name of the person so that would come inside the dialog. So we need to properly anonymize that person.",
            "Okay. I will,, make the, for consent form. May I show it to you before I give it to participan.",
            "Yes, please. Yes, please. Please do it. Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "And one more thing is coming to my mind. I don't know,, whether we need that or not. But if we just talk about that same point. If you want to show that our data is of gold standard then probably,, we, we also have to make an interface for that for making the manual evaluation. What do you say? There is some disturbance.",
            "Sorry I have some disturbance around. Could you repeat it please? Sorry.",
            "Yes. So I was saying that,, the,, we were just talking about. So,, PERSON7 suggested a very good point that to make this as a,, go, gold standard,, data. To make our data which we have,, we have collected,, as gold standard, just to prove that it is a gold standard data. We have to,, pass it through some manual evaluation. So it fits to certain parameters. And so for that I think we also then have to design some interface for it to make, to make the ratings of - Because the data size is, is huge. It has 80k or 100k. 80 to 100k for English. So each of the minute and, giving some rating to it won't be that easy. And I think an interface for that will really help. Just to show that this is a gold standard, data. What do you mean by interfaces? A setca a set of, of questions?",
            "As,, yes. So maybe like the one which PERSON1 has developed for,, the,, the already,, thing. Already the data, I think alignment and all. So same interface for this as well. For the manual evaluation guidelines which will be develop.",
            "Aha. Aha.",
            "So, rating for that. So this will appear, the data will appear and the people are going to rate it. So, just on the gold, gold standard measures. So we would set some key points. And we will say that these are the five key points where we have a.",
            "Oh, oh. Do you suppose that they were re-evaluated it,, comparing to the transcript or without using the transcript?",
            "So I think, -",
            "So if we -",
            "Maybe acting w, we should consider transcript. But transcript -",
            "So if they don't - So,.",
            "If we, if we take transcript and we also show the reference summary by annotators, it will be very difficult to map them and give ratings for that.",
            "But if you,,, well. Realistically if you don't have a transcript and just look at the minutes at the refere at the summary. You actually, if you manually created summary you don't really know if it is good or bad. Because it is always -",
            "Aha.",
            "Readable it is always kind of coherent. It looks well. It looks like there are some important points.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So, ye an then you have to subjectively estimate if it is good or bad. And this will be very, er, kind of unreliable bit because it depends on if you like longer or shorter descriptions, if you don't like that they begin with a small, low case or something. But if you take its,, from another rave you, n use the transcript then this is quite a big work to tr to estimate -",
            "Yes.",
            "To, to, to ma to estimate it.",
            "Because -",
            "Yes so this -",
            "Transcript will be a size. So it will be multiple pages.",
            "So this point.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So this point I want to redirect with,, PERSON6. So,, this is a good point to define the manual evaluation thing. But,, we should also at the same time keep track of the facticality aspect that we need to do this by December.",
            "So this evaluation should be there in our background that we have to do this.",
            "Should -",
            "And we have to evaluate our meetings.",
            "Maybe. So that's why I thought about that task for PERSON2 for making, n for comparing meetings, -",
            "For the same, so minutes for the same meeting and,,, contra to minutes for different meetings. The so, so it also could, this automatic measurement could also help in that respect. So if that -",
            "If you have,, bad,, if you can distinguish them it,, with higher number, ye, it, it says something about the quality of the minutes versu, maybe it could be also used. Can't it be?",
            "Yes, yes, it can be. But,, to be very specific I think,, we have two, set some parameters for that. If you talk about manual.",
            "Well and about manual,.",
            "Because, you know, like, if we have to do the manual annotation again, on the minutes, like if you set some parameters and you ask the annotators to annotate them again that whether, this falls into some quality standard or not, it will consume time. So I'm absolutely partitude this, but at the same time I want to leverage on whatever we already have. Because -",
            "So you think that now we should set up a set of questions that will help us evaluate manual minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Then we should give them immediately, to annotators. So they, they start as soon as possible to evaluate,, many minutes. Let's do it. Yes. We can do that.",
            "Yes, right.",
            "And even,, PERSON6, I think formulating the, the guidelines of manual evaluation will also help if we first give the transcript and the summary to annotators that's maybe from the linguistic point of view can see,, what difference is there in-between them. So all those points can also be mapped. Because we already have annotators. And maybe we can frame those cautions based on that.",
            "Okay from this,, aha, one, well, well yes, but,, we don't have it implemented. So we don't have even implemented the first,, interface,, and we don't have the second at all. And PERSON1 is, so will not tried it, immediately, because he has lot different thing to do. I just tought that we could do,, what we could do, if,, immediately, as far as, soon as we can, implement this PERSON1's guidelines.",
            "About guidelines, interface. And start giving existing meeting to annotators,, with 2 task they can align it and,, estimate it. Because if they are already aligned they will read it and they will see the minutes and they will have the estimations immediately in mind. So they will have a good estimation.",
            "Like -",
            "Could we do that? Should we do that? So let's, let's do,, so let's,, start this alignment as soon as possible.",
            "Yes, so to the, I will look into the interface and see how it works, and -",
            "Like, might be, like some of choose that it, it has, it exists and are we calling to PERSON1 for this? Maybe set up a meeting with him. And I will get back to you on this very soon.",
            "Okay,.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "And the thing about the, the manual validation. So if you could do it. I think it will take time for, to really frame up some good questions that, what constitutes a good minute.",
            "So,, so the thing is that,, my only concern is whatever we do,, at least for the first shared task we need to freeze our pipeline, or our work flow very soon. And not deviate from that and do the first shared task and keep our,, our like other ideas also going in parallel but for the shared task I think we need to fix things very soon.",
            "So that our annotators, because I data and, yeah.",
            "Yes. And maybe,, is PERSON5, PERSON5 are you there?",
            "Yes I'm here.",
            "As you started to write this manual evaluation protocol I saw some questions already there for the evaluation of,, minutes some as, topicality, grammaticality, clarity, fluency. What, where do they come from these,, estimations? Is it, is there some state of the art how to measure, how to estimate it? So I also have found some other estimated questions. If there are something that we should know,, before we,, create this questions.",
            "Well that's,, what I have read when I did, I have done some research on these things. Like I have some papers about evaluation and -",
            "That is usually the criteria that they use.",
            "So -",
            "To, to is the way we should we.",
            "So -",
            "I will -",
            "Sounds -",
            "It's not complete yet.",
            "Yeah, I see that. So, so this actually what you begin, we have to finish now this cr this questions which to ask.",
            "Yes I will detail them. I will, because I -",
            "Yeah. I have seen also some kind of text understandability, is the maybe, maybe some overall exte expression, should, should it be there? Shouldn't it be there? So I, I don't have such experience as you have.",
            "I will finish it. I will detail it.",
            "Okay. Okay. Okay.",
            "I will just finish it in a few,, today or tomorrow and then we can -",
            "Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you.",
            "But now please just send me the path of the data set, because I'm not able to find it. It's very messy, the minut PROJECT1 minuting path in the classerer has become very messy so.",
            "But you know been there. PROJECT1 minuting corpus and then. PROJECT1 minuting corpus original recording and within that, all of it. Okay, but you should also put it in the spread sheet.",
            "Which spread sheet? Well I will e-mail it to you. I, I okay. I, I see. Okay.",
            "You can just put it there and I have the link obviously.",
            "Yeah. I, I, I did it.",
            "Okay. Thanks.",
            "The ORGANIZATION1 spread sheet, I will. Okay. Okay. So fo we can stop for now yes? I think.",
            "Could you, PERSON7 did you set up,, the SSH?",
            "Yeah, yeah I did.",
            "You did? And,, did someone contact, I think O PERSON4 already did e-mail regarding that. So we don't have any meeting right now, right? Or is it something which is scheduled for now?",
            "I think we have the normal coffee hours.",
            "And is that,, something scheduled for the demonstration of SSH?",
            "I don't know -",
            "So PERSON4 -",
            "I guess.",
            "PERSON4 already actually e-mailed regarding that.",
            "Yeah, so they will, like reply right? So this will confirm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Otherwise I'm fine with accessing, yeah. Okay, so sounds we are on, we are a little bit clear if not at all and okay, so. Let's meet tomorrow?",
            "Okay.",
            "See you. Thank you.",
            "Okay, so, yeah. Thank you.",

No, yeah, he's there. PERSON13. Yes, so he is receiving that the PROJECT1 at ORGANIZATION11 mailing list. So PERSON13.",
            "Ok. We will prompt it here directly of this call.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",

            "So, maybe PERSON13 would be the.",
            "Ok.",
            "Because it's PERSON13 is usually responding and also the the ORGANIZATION5 for that is like we always use a ORGANIZATION5 when the session is running. But we don't use it normally for the for the arrangement like when to start and so on. So. But. Yeah. So I'd say PERSON13 from ORGANIZATION6 and then ma We need to make sure that everybody will be on ORGANIZATION5 during the demo itself.",

And I think that the set of the languages it should be all we have at the moment. But the main question is which should be the input language and in the call they ORGANIZATION12 said the German would be ok for them. So I think we should be ready for for German source.",
            "Ok, nice.",
            "And like double check with them but if they if they now realize that German is a bad idea then that's now a problem and we switch to English as the source.",
            "Ok. I'm going to adds this one. German as input and English as back up. Ok. Well, and translate it in all the available languages are we sure?",
            "Yeah, I would say so. Why not? It's, what would, what could be the problem?",
            "I don't know. Do we have a tested the machine translation, well the speech language translation starting from German to so all the other possible languages?",
            "So it goes via English of course. And what we have tested several times is from Czech into English and then from English into the other languages. So we have not tested.",
            "Ok.",
            "With German source, I agree. But I kind of trust the German to English ORGANIZATION12 model. And I the the English to everything is the best that we have all the time. Like it's.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "We should we should double check the target languages and and make a clear warning to PERSON3 with Romanian is not to up to our standard so to say.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So so PERSON3 is Romanian. And we have.",
            "Ok.",
            "Romanian speakers, there are some in, or there used to be, some in ORGANIZATION6. So we should probably do demo run and we should ask some Romanian people to to check. So that would be another question for for the ORGANIZATION6 people.",
            "Ok. For the 2 check the unders.",
            "Yeah, yeah the quality of.",
            "Yeah, I I didn't know how to to formulate it.. Ok. Do we have Romanian.",
            "And the Romanian speakers that we know about. No, ok. So we don't have-We are not aware of any Romanian speakers.",
            "Ok. Ok, write write.",
            "Map of colleagues who can speak some Romanian or some languages. We have this ORGANIZATION11 language map. We don't have access to any any Romanian speaker.",
            "No, we have but would you like we check with some Romanian people.",
            "Yes, if you can-Yeah.",
            "Actually we do not have a sources. Romanian sources. But you you told us that maybe the ORGANIZATION6 have.",
            "They used to have. But.",
            "Ok.",
            "That's like a year and half ago. When that colleague defended her thesis. And I'm not sure if she's if she's with ORGANIZATION6 or not. I'll actually e-mail her. I'll try to find an e-mail. If I have it. Yep, yep, yep. But I have only her ORGANIZATION6 e-mail. Ok. So I'll try. So I'll ask if if she could review that for us and I'll e-mail you. Can you check. And I'll copy actually PERSON9 as well. Who else should-So I think that for PERSON1-Her name is PERSON1. And I'm thinking who should be involved in the testing. Maybe PERSON13 then as well. Because there should be like one session that she would watch.",
            "Translation of probably German speech into. Yeah. So I've I've asked her and hopefully she will be able to to check this for us. I have no idea. So we'll see. So that's it. So that's we need we need to choose the date for the demo itself. That's the Doodle pool. I need to fill it for myself. We really should run a pre-demo session. And we can run it when we are available. And also we should run it when PERSON1 is available for the second like. Possibly at the same time or at some other time. Ok. And we need to choose the the source, here. PERSON11 ask PERSON1 which date. Define demo input. Yeah. What demo input. So can you pick something or.",
            "Yes, actually I'm little bit worried about the domain of the input. Because actually we need something that performs. First of all-ASR.",
            "That's right.",
            "And I don't know. Actually we as let's say, as as project we have to prepare something related to the ORGANIZATION8 congress.",
            "Yes, that's right.",
            "But i don't know if we have actually real data or not. Or if the prepared or not.",
            "Yeah, that's.",
            "Usually.",
            "That's very good point, so there are. What we have is some Youtube videos that are already consecutevely translated into Czech. So we have one Czech-German video. I'll try to find it. Data. Youtube. Youtube channels. Youtube selected. Translation, German, port view.",
            "Often the the training data are from TED talks. But also ORGANIZATION4 sessions. And maybe also an EUROPEAN session like the something that looks like a congress let's say. But is perfectly in domain, I don't know. I don't know, we have to ask first to to ORGANIZATION12 to for the German ASR.",
            "Sorry, I'm loosing you now. Because I'm, this is. What is this language.",
            "We have to ask to ORGANIZATION12 the domain of their ASR.",
            "Yes. I'm now checking the video. But this is all English, it was supposed to be German. So ORGANIZATION10 is very good. And it would be hard to compete with ORGANIZATION10. So that's why we should pick really something which is not in English. Because ORGANIZATION10's ASR so-Possible idea's, well concerns. And that's domain match with our systems. Yeah, possible ideas. So this is.",
            "Ok. Let me check it.",
            "This is a German speaker. But he speaks English.",
            "Ok.",
            "ORGANIZATION10 is too good on this I guess. So I thought that it was-Actually this is strange, Dutch-I'll double check again. So this is another one would be part of the PROJECT1 edible SLT test set if I'm not mistaken. My ball, yeah. So I don't I hear anything. Speaking. That's again ok. That's still again English, yeah. I see. So I will-Youtube channel. We had some which was German. So how about how about going for Italian source. Would that be risky? How is your.",
            "Yes, it will be risky. Because we never test the Italian ASR together with everything.",
            "That's right. Yeah. How do I get-If I know a channel ID.",
            "If the problem is to search for German videos, well don't worry, we we can do it with within this week we can search for something, don't worry.",
            "Yes, so well. We already have some link and that's why I'm trying to revive some of those. That's probably it. You see view. The channel ID has changed. Strange. So here's to me, this is just-Aha., ORGANIZATION10 is great also also for German that's too bad. ORGANIZATION10 is very very good. So this is.",
            "Well, you you test it several times.",
            "We could.",
            "Actually you have tested each Monday for several weeks.",
            "Most of these were actually in English. So it were, there were few more sessions in Czech than in English. But it was like native speakers of Czech speaking English. But. Yeah, so doing doing Czech would be also-German text. ORGANIZATION10 also already pretty good. That's too bad. And I'll actually list the. So this is the channel. Channel of German SAI or of Austrian SAI. And for. So this is something which you could choose from. And I'll also check that the Czech one. So Czech. There's is so difficult to Yep. Oh they have 22 subscribers and 50 videos. That's a plenty. So there is like 3 minute video. So Czech 3 minute and 10. So just a second I'll get someone some paper. So so here are some Czech videos. There is a channel of the ORGANIZATION2. Some of the videos are in English and some are in Czech.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "So there is there are very short like 1 minute. They're really very very short. There is, yes. 5 years, there is 40, there is 46 minutes. So lower in the list. There is a conference of 5 years of some reform or whatever. Yeah, so so now I'm checking one of the random longer videos. The 4 minute one. And that is the the person is is like slipping, his tongue is slipping. Like I don't know the English term for that. So that's probably to that's something to choose from. If we really. These are probably the best sources because we do not directly compete with ORGANIZATION10.",
            "Yes, but we have to check the ASR performance.",
            "Yeah, yeah. We have to choose something which which seems to.",
            "Transcription of those videos to.",
            "Say that again, sorry?",
            "We do not have the verbal transcription of those videos.",
            "No, no. Of course not. But that's the point. Like it's, it would not be fair to to include it into language model I think.",
            "The performance. Is required.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok. So if you wanted like the exact evaluation. Yes that. So if we-I think the point of the demo is to show how it runs when it runs. Like.",
            "Ok. That's definitely fair. Ok, ok. We will search for other possible ideas, of course.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In focus on the German languages.",
            "Sources. Yeah.",
            "Sources, ok.",
            "Who'll present the demo. Yes. I can. So the location. Like the location if we'll be remote. So how do we do it?",
            "Who will run the pipe?",
            "Who will run the pipe, yes. Probably us, I agree. Yes, yes, yes. So probably.",
            "I thought about this parts actually. We have to think about how to share also the audio. With with project officer because actually sharing the screen is fine in order to let him see the results. But sharing the audio might be a little bit more complex, unfortunately.",
            "So what are the options. We actually need-So it should be like remote call. And then one of the participants should be the machine which place the video. For everybody but then.",
            "Yep. Could, yes.",
            "But then we really need to check that the machine is strong enough for that. Because it will be both like watching the video-Yes, so this is something for PERSON9 to test. So to test for PERSON9. So run the video in Youtube. So so connect 2 machines. That's it, so. Connect 2 machines to conferencing platform. Run the Youtube. So. So 1 is for you to talk to others. The other one needs to be good enough to run the video in Youtube. Send the audio to the conferencing platform. Send the audio to the complete subtitling pipeline. Yeah.",
            "Do we ever, conference single platform? To be used for the call?",
            "No, we can choose anything. So I don't know which is the most light weight. So ORGANIZATION1 should be ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "ORGANIZATION1 is this one, right?",
            "Yes. But we need to book it obviously. And we can also use ORGANIZATION9 but ORGANIZATION9 was kind of heavy. So yeah please talk to talk to PERSON9. What work best. So far. So I'll actually. PERSON9. Please check which conferencing platform is the lightest for this. Obviously we should avoid any videos transmission. Only the sound and only out going. Yeah, so I've. Will. Who will start the pipeline. After May 11. So actually the restrictions in the Czech republic are are getting easier and easier. So I think that we should be able to meet after MAy 11. It's actually a date in one of the recent regulation by the government.",
            "Ok, nice.",
            "So test. Yes, exactly. So the test, test, test, test. I totally agree. Yep.",
            "Well.",
            "So what else? I think this is it, for for now. Yes. So please make sure that everybody agrees when when to make these tests.",
            "I I hope maybe will be able to schedule check with my agenda because are really crazy. Ok, maybe we can mix some more tests tomorrow with PERSON9. I I I will PERSON9 in order to start checking the first things.",
            "Yeah. So today it-Yeah, today it's 6, PERSON9 is still probably helping PERSON4 another colleague of mine, the Uni hack. The PROJECT5 I Maybe I have mentioned it maybe not. We are trying to do remote subtitling for PROJECT5 which run over this weekend in like only the plannery sessions. Which run in the Czech language this this last weekend. And today is the closing day so the already closing session, if I'm not mistaken. So from tomorrow on word PERSON9 can focus on the demo. And there is no other session planned except the demo, so he can really put all his effort into that.",
            "Ok. I read about the PROJECT5 in your e-mails.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Ok. I think that for today it's.",
            "Ok, great, great. So thanks. I'll fill the Doodle shortly. But that's not important, most important are the other and the tests.",

            "Thanks, it is better passing to PERSON3.",
            "So yeah, its PERSON9 right? So. So, for last two weeks i've been working, i started with training new language model for domain adaptation, ASR. So now we have, now we can have better adaptation, before like meetings and all. Secondly I was trying to. Yeah yeah.",
            "What tool are you using for the language model adaptation?",
            "Script that was shared by PERSON1. So I don't think i would understand whats in the. So I just and data with text data. English text data. And i think that we can have better language model because if we use the, text, like some text data. Maybe like sentences from his presentation, and if we into language and build the language model then we can have a adaptation, because until now we were just writing, and mapping them to some other words that did not exist in the earlier language model. So this is going to be better. And nextly I was trying to run the, docker on U4 machine, and its like. With that, so yeah thats like, apart from this I also done automatic audio transcription and there were a lot of transcription. Next I trained new model for Czech using the Czech data set and I currently have two models. And they are both, they are both right on the GitHub. Depositary Czech segmenter. Apart from that currently I am working on to get SLT into action. And I'm also fixing the from PERSON4. And I'm also planning a new Czech segmenter using the data set that user PERSON9. And they were like a lot of sentences, so I just took 6 million of them, and lets see how the be new model. And next I'm planning to models using Czech, using Czech data, so I'll use Czech data. So that's all from me. For yeah. Any questions PERSON9?",
            "Regarding the domain adaptation of the language model, we can maybe. Sometimes I work on kind of similar things for Czech.",
            "Sure sure sure sure.",
            "Yeah, I I started I think I mentioned it in previous meeting, I worked on like. Like data based, so how it worked is that you have some domain. And you have large corpus of some other language for example.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yes.",
            "On the like, domain data based sentences to your domain. Like this week. Work model, and a can you hear me?",
            "Yeah, I can hear you, I had to turn my microphone off to hear you.",
            "Oh okay i see. So yeah, just maybe it could be interesting if we meet and yeah we can try to coordinate the work on the language adaptation together.",
            "So, maybe find some time to work and actually whats happening inside. And we can make together.",
            "I would actually be like interested like what toolkit they use for the language modeling or if they have like, their their own, toolkit for that or if they use for example the. So, because I use the KenLM toolkit and there is quite nice option, they have quite good performance in terms of interpolations of different language models, so you don't train only one language model, but you have like some big baseline language model and then you have a some small domain model and you interpolate between them like based on some development set on which you tune the city.",
            "Um-hum, yeah, yeah yeah.",
            "There would be option to ngram model, I think it could be interesting as well to try maybe use can LM it give.",
            "Yeah sure, we can discuss more details when we meet in person, and lets see if we can achieve more better language model adaptation. Domain adaptation, domain data, and yeah.",
            "Yeah sure.",
            "Okay thats all from me now, PERSON8 will speak.",
            "Last week I worked data collection, basically, but during when we started translation this week, so I worked some again model language data. So right now I'm working on training, so, I am waiting for PERSON2.",
            "Which languages?",
            "English and French. So right now I have started with German, French. But I'm last week to discuss with PERSON2, because PERSON2 is already working on translation then, record some then you'll start translation systems. So I don't see any update from PERSON2, so I am waiting. Okay I will send an email to PERSON2. So thats it. Yes. Yes, so now PERSON9, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, so, yeah I basically been working on a pipeline I've connected this sentence embedings that I've already mentioned with like this Subaczech corpus, which is basically a huge corpus of a Czech news articles, and there is always headline of the article and a short abstract and then there is full text, so what I'm doing I got some, like domain sentences and based on these i searched through the abstracts and headlines to find the most like similar articles that match my domain and then i take the full article texts and use them to extend the language model to make the adaptation for that domain so yeah I'm working on it as part of my diplomathysis so I'm like have like 5 domains different from each other and, yeah I'm trying to do this techniques for each of them. And to see if there are some improvements, actually I measured and seems seems to give seems to give like quite the constant improvements across the domains, so it yeah, I'm so that was yeah, that was the main I have been working on this week.",
            "Okay thanks. Can you write it to the document? PERSON9?",
            "I will write there.",
            "So this is mostly for PERSON11 now. Cause we had to, PERSON11 wants to read it and. Thank you I think we can you can quit the meeting. If you don't have any questions. So bye.",
            "Bye, see you.",

            "Hello. How are you?",
            "Okay, so I think PERSON7 is also there, so - PERSON4, if you want you can like first show the inter working of the interface, maybe, and then, show the installation. And, then what are the what are the synchronization works that are left.",
            "Okay. So I'll start with, documentation that has been put together. I don't know whether you have access to it.",
            "Yes, yes, we do have.",
            "Okay. So, I think the installation and basic usage is well documented there. But, maybe I'll share my screen. So I need to figure up how to do it.",
            "Yes, yes, okay.",
            "Share screen -",
            "So you can see sha. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Is visible my screen already?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay. So, maybe the installation is, more, interesting from the from the developer point of view, because you you'll be probably, managing it,, later. So, the installation differs for for, Linux and for Windows. I have in the in the first quarter repository there is Linux folder and Windows folder. And, the Linux installation is quite, straightforward. And it could give you relatively clear view of what you actually need, what dependencies you need to actually install. And I think it's Python three which I guess is normally normally, standard, standardly shipped with the Linux. Then you need to have, Python virtual environment, because, because the the tool uses some Python packages. And I'm not really sure whether everyone wants to install the Python packages globally. So that's why, the installation create, creates here it is this command, creates - I can - Creates virtual environment. And, and all installation is, finished with getting the whole and latest, repository from the code from the repository. Because it's Python, it's interpreted, so it's sufi it's sufficient to just, download the deep hub repository with the code. So, very important for you are the packages that that are required. Maybe you will need to, update the requirements. The requirements are here, so it's just three packages. And - Yeah, that's that's the installation on Linux. On Windows it's a bit trickier. Because,, Windows does not have, package manager, so one have to install for example the Python manually. And, also because there are, too different architectures of the Windows. You can have either, thirty two bits or sixty four bits. So you have to download, the right package. And right, libraries, just to, just to be compatible with each other. So, I think that's the installation, you maybe have to go through the scripts. And I'm quite sure you'll have some questions about it. And I I can fill some more comments to the code, but just go over the code and maybe you you'll figure it out,, maybe it's easy. Okay. So the that's the installation,, and now I can just run the program. So programatically it's really easy. Just call the - Just execute the Run by, script, and window emerges. I don't know - Can you see the annotations window now?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, so, okay, so there's a annotation, window. I o I open new, existing, existing meeting, so so - Here, you can - I guess I can make it bit larger. So, here, the window left part of the of the window is the transcript. You can - Each meeting can have more transcript because, because I think that, each each meeting, has automatically created transcript by some ASR. And, corrected transcript provided ba by some, by some, annotator. So this should be the - This should be the corrected transcript. So you can choose it, so here just demo ASR transcript. And,, there's the the whole transcript. In the right side of the of the window you can see minutes. You can choose, which version of minutes you want to work with. And, the colours here and here,, are are to, show the dependency between the minute and, some dialogue acts. And you can use, you choose whatever dialogue act you want and you can link the - You can link them with some minutes. So for example, I changed the colour. So these mi this dialogue acts are linked with, the this this minute and I can make it back. I think it's here. And, there is also some, context menu, you can you can choose some minutes. You can either reset minutes. That means I remove removed the colour and the the linking with the minutes here. And, you can also you have here problem column. It's, it's a special special column that I think PERSON6 can can explain it better than me. But, for example, this talk like: Can you hear me? Or, or: Let's talk about another, topic. That's like organizational. It it has no minute in in the minute panel. But, it it's organizational. So, you can also reset problem, or I think it's back. And, there's, that's the third panel here in the in the right bottom. And it's the playback. I - So, I I sh I shift some video to to the meetings. It is possible even to - So, some meetings are recorded including, video. And because I'm using, VLS player in the background for, playback, it is impossible to to see the video,, from the from the recording. And - But this video is not is not integrated to the to the, to this annotations window, but it's separate window. So, you can change, speed of the of the recording, you can play it, stop it. You can fastforward forward or backwards. And, using this, what is it - So - I don't know, I forget how this what's this tool here. But it just you can adjust, the time, the current time. Yeah, and - And I think I covered it almost all. If you have any questions just ask me.",
            "Okay, so, PERSON4. I have some questions regarding the installation.",
            "Yeah, sure, go ahead.",
            "Okay, so so I went through your installation guide in the Linux. Can you open the, that ORGANIZATION1 doc, that, maybe you have or PERSON6 have prepared.",
            "Yeah.Right.",
            "Can you check that if if if it is like if it is allocate with, with the current installation showed?",
            "I think it should, because, the - Let me see that scipt. Yeah. This should, this should be everything. So I can check whether I have VLS installed, I have VLS installed. And, mhmh, so first, we are checking whether the Python is installed. Then we see whether the Python we when is installed. VLS is installed. Yeah, uf, uf, uf - Yeah, it seems that it should be correct.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "And, it's it to install it on Wi on, Linux just just you have to just execute that install script. Maybe, maybe there should be, this extra sudo here. Because, I'm actually not sure, because as you can see here, when you're installing some packages in in Linux, you, you must be super user.",
            "And, I I'm not sure whether it's device to to type sudo here in the installation script. Or you have to, execute the whole installation script with super user, privilages. I'm not sure right now. But, yeah. Do you have some problems, with, running the these, this script on on, Linux?",
            "Yeah, I found some problems while installing it directly.",
            "And - Maybe you can, maybe you can, give me some details about it? Or can you, can you share you screen and -",
            "Yes.",
            "And install it?",
            "Okay, so I'm in a different machine so what I will do is - Can I can I send you some screenshots maybe? And I will try with both Windows and Linux. I will send you the screenshots. Maybe I immediately after this meeting. And -",
            "Okay,",
            "I think those can be resolved, quite easily. So the, okay - So the other thing that I want to know is, about the actual annotation thing. So you showed some highlighting things, in the, in the interface. So can you like, like what is the output of this? Can you show that suppose -",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "From the beginning. Suppose you want to annotate, what we should -",
            "Sure. Sure, sure. So - It's not here, but I can do here. Mm-hmm, to check. So, this is the folder with, actual meeting. In the root folder that's the the the meeting name it's Demo. And, in a root folder there are three sub-folders. There's the annotations, minutes and transcripts folder. Transcripts, contains, text, contains transcripts and these have, special structure. Each each line is the separate, dialogue act. It's actually CBS file or or the the format is CBS, because it has, four columns. In the first column there's the actual text of the dialogue act. In the second column there's, speaker and, third and fourth column are time stamps. First is the starting time stamps in seconds and the scond one is the time stamp, of the end of the DA. If, the synchronization between DAs and,, the recording is not provided and there's the minus one indicating there's there's no, time sta time step, stamp avilable for the DA. So these this is the structure of transcripts or DAs. In the minutes, in the minutes there are - It's it's just simple, simple text file without any any, formating. So you can - So, that's the PERSON5 minutes so as you can see here the structure. And if I go here, PERSON5 minutes it's just simple text file. So now now now formating is needed, whatsever. And annotations,, are created, in a way that each version of transcript, I mean the each - So here's the corrected transcript and, is paired with for example PERSON5 minutes. So you can see for example here is the: Corrected transcript plus, in the name, and PERSON5 minutes. And, here is the connect, here is the, pairing between the the transcript, so the DAs and minutes. So we see in the first column, that the sixth, sixth minute,, sorry, sixth DA, so it's the sixth DA, is, is connected to third minutes, yeah. And and here is it too because it's, the indexec are, indices are, starting from zero. And, we also can see that the - There's organizational problem, which is the first one. And in the third column, there's zero, which indicates there's the this sixth minute, sixth DA is connected or paired with the first problem. Or for example you can see that the nineth or - That the, sorry, fourteenth, DA has no problem connected to it. Okay, I can show it. There's this this problem here there's no problem connected. So here's none. In the third column. And, final thing, in the meeting structure is is in the root folder you can, you can copy paste the recording of the meeting, and it can have, what - It can have. So I will paste it here the office, series, if you know the office series. And, the annotation tool will just search in the in the root folder for any any playable recording, whether it is audio recording or video.",
            "So, so once the annotation is done,, that, annotation file is automatically saved in that folder?",
            "I can show you that. For example I will, I will pair the very first dialogue act with with the very first minute, yeah? The red coulour, you see? And, and and I will just click save and we go to the folder. So that's annotations, we have been working with corrected transcript and PERSON5 minutes, so I open this file and you can see the very first line. That's the zero DA is connected to the zero minute and I have I haven't any problems or there's none.",
            "Okay. Thank you. Okay, yeah -",
            "So any, any more questions?",
            "I think I think up till now I have understood, I will like again try installing with the with the instructions. And I will send you the screenshots if there's any problem. Now that means what are the remaining things we need to do with?",
            "So,, the PERSON2 thinks, that has to be done is to co is to, finalize or actually implement the whole, synchronization of of the meetings. Because now the only way how to actually, how annotator can actually, send results to the to PERSON6 for example, is just to go to the meeting folder and click compress it and send it via e-mail or something. And, there's - We thought that maybe it could be interesting to use for example Git to to, synchronize the transcript, minutes and annotations. But, the problem is this recording, because it it's just too big to be, synchronized over over, over Git. So, there has to be some work around and, I had idea that maybe we can set up some website. We need to discuss it with the IT, and we can set up some, web page that would, that could have for example folder recordings available. And maybe instead of, copying the video or or the recording here in the in the root folder we can just create a new file here. For example, we can create some recording, text file and we can copy paste, we can give here some new URL to the to the webserver, where the where the recording leaves. And and annotation tool can detect the the link and could download it later, for example. Because the annotator does not alter alter the recording, the annotator alters only minutes, transcript and annotations.",
            "Okay. So you mean to set up synchronisation file is left from this interface, right?",
            "Yes, and I guess there's one more thing - It's just, maybe I can I can do it myself, and it's that I haven't - I've I've talked about that synchronization between, dialogue acts and, and and, and the recording. And as I showed you here there's the this there should be time stamps and, what we have to do is to implement, some time stamping, utility in cluster. So that we, if we provide, if we provide transcript, we get transcript with time stamps. That's on the cluster side and, I haven't finished the the synchronization in the programme. So the idea is that when you click on some DA, it should, change the time to the start of the time stamp. But that's just, I don't know, maybe three lines of codes that has to be added and - But, but the actual pr actual problem is to create time stamping script on the cluster, yes? It's actually the only problem.",
            "Okay.",
            "But I can do it also but, it will take me some time to do that.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Right now, because I have some some deadlines to follow.",
            "Yes, yes, we understand. So I think, this, this cosmetic changes are not very crucial for the current annotation, because the thing that we really need now is the. So, I think we can,, we can work on this? But that we need to like discuss and figure out how we do this. So what I will do right now is I will try do this both on Windows and Linux. I tried it only once but I will get back to you. With the problems. And then I will manu I will do one annotation from my end. So just to be satisfied that. Okay, - We are on the same page and then maybe we can start connecting with annotators. Is that okay?",
            "Yes. Yeah, sure.",
            "Okay, okay. PERSON6, you have any questions or PERSON1 or PERSON7?",
            "So I have one question for PERSON4.",
            "Yes, go ahead.",
            "PERSON4 these these colours indicate problems in the in the transcript, right?",
            "No the problems, the linking between, the dialogue acts and minutes. The problems are are not not indicated bu by colour, but by the text in the problem column. So for example here we can see is the organizational problem. And for example I can s add here the speech incomprehensible problem for this third dialogue act.",
            "Oh, so the only these set of problems are are scripted here? Only these four kinds of problems? Or there are some other classification.",
            "Yes. Maybe may. This this four problems are hardcorded to the program. But, maybe we can discuss it with PERSON6 and we can make this problems editable. So maybe, for example, we can I have here the settings, window and we can add here some some tool that could, add or remove some problems.",
            "But l think this four four problems can can cover almost all all problems that are, in in the annotations.",
            "So what does these colour indicate? So is there some relevance of the colour, difference of colour, or no?",
            "No, no the the colours are, random, but they are to just to distinguish that for example from six to to thirteenth, the dialogue acts are linked with, the third minute. And then from fourteenth DA to the sixteenth DA the linking is to the fourth minute, here.",
            "So and as as you can see, this minutes ther this dialogue acts there are basically right now have now no colour. That means that there's no linking to the minutes.",
            "And as I scroll up and, more colours emerges, we can see that which which dialogue acts are linked to which, minutes. As you can see.",
            "So the linking part is coloured -",
            "So the colour. Yes, yes, yes. It's finished.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "Any more questions?",
            "I think - Yeah. PERSON6, I think, manual evaluation can be easily integrated into this tool. Because,, there is actually a mapping of the, transcript, and the the minute. So, the annotators can also evaluate in this particular platform itselfs. Which PERSON4 has formed. PERSON6? Oh, hey there - PERSON6? Oh, I think - Okay, maybe you go ahead with and discuss it with her later. You can go ahead with, the conversation maybe.",
            "So we have less than a minute left.",
            "If we have no questions, I will get back to PERSON4 offline."

        "utterances": [
            "Yes, so everybody is fine with recording. And I would like to ask PERSON9 to start recording now, so hopefully we can start it. Yeah. So the first thing is the Kick-off meeting. The date is more or less set, it's the - I think it's fifteenth of January, it's Tuesday. And the question is whether you would prefer a half day before that and a half day after that or a half day after that. So either the Wednesday morning, or a Monday evening as a like second half of Monday as well, and I would like to leave this so far undecided and let you know soon, obviously, we will consider the boards that you have in the Doodle. So please take this into account and refine your your choices around the fifteenth of January. Whether it is easier for you to come for Monday or to come for Wednesday. And the other decision, the other point, that I would like to have before I make the final decision is, whether we should meet in person with the ORGANIZATION15. So, for those of who know, or for those who don't know, ORGANIZATION15 is the company that ORGANIZATION3 has like independently solicited to create the competing solution for the automatic translation of their conferences. And as I have already talked to ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION13, ORGANIZATION3 is like half way apologetic for was situation as it as it finally ended up being, because of very various tank constraints. They were first like talking to us, then it was not sure whether our project will be accepted, And in the meantime, they were already anxious, how the will they support their congress and so on, so they also searched for the commercial solution. And in the end, they had to have two possible providers for that. So I've talked to the ORGANIZATION15 company, it's just ORGANIZATION15 I think cz or com. Their website does not mention any translation of conferences, any speech translation whatsoever. This is like new domain for them, but they're quite quick in getting the technology put together. They rely on ORGANIZATION6 Tools. So all they do is just like a gathering the speech signal, then segmenting it and sending it per parts to ORGANIZATION6 ASR. And then receiving these parts and sending that again per parts to ORGANIZATION6 translate. And then what they have, is this presenting application on cell phones, and also web on the Web. And they present the translations of what is being said. They've put together this integration tool in about two months off, like two persons, And they have already tested it at one of the ORGANIZATION3 events in November. And they know like, what everything has to be improve and so on. And they. So we all know, that this is a potential very big conflict or a competition, especially with ORGANIZATION13, but we have discussed this and we'll keep discussing it for Don. And there is ways, in which like this collaboration instead of competition can be beneficial for everyone. This company does not build their own models, So of all the partners, who are building their speech or or text processing models, are very good like providers of solutions to this company. And this company is, on the other hand, could like help us in marketing and selling the product, So because they have their experience from the past, they have customers in the LOCATION3 for other topics, they could help us in on the business part of PROJECT1. So I propose that those who are interested should probably meet with ORGANIZATION15 in person, so that we will directly discuss how to partition the space, so that we reduce the competition aspect on at least on the business side, And keep it for the for the technological side as a competition between the models that we created versus that ORGANIZATION6 develops. And for this meeting I think it would be a nice opportunity to collocate it with the with the Kick-off meeting. And that's why I would kind of suggest you to have this the meeting with ORGANIZATION15 around our meeting either on Monday morning or on Wednesday afternoon. And I'll talk to ORGANIZATION15, if you agree, I will then talk to ORGANIZATION15 and see what their preferences are and based on that like set the dates for our Kick-off meeting. So I know that ORGANIZATION5 is not on the call, but if PERSON5 can comment on this right away, maybe in general and not necessarily specifying the date, but in general.",
            "For me, it is okay.",
            "Yeah. Yes, so, if I don't hear no from PERSON12, then I will invite ORGANIZATION15 to tell their date and then we'll meet. And again, others from the consortium can also meet this company, but it is not needed. So this is, this would be like up to you, whether you want to be in this discussions or not. Okay. Well, I'm as I'm speaking, I'm not able to type, really, So if someone can populate the minutes, as we go in the way, that the automatic minuting would do, That would be great. So maybe if you are editing the document as well. Yeah. So then, as you see, we have set up the website. I'm sharing my screen, so maybe we will be able to see it on my screenshare. Yes. So the big question that we have now is whether we should use the Serif or Sans Serif font through all the webpage. If you have any opinion plea, please let us know. And the webpage will be will be like a regularly populated. We also have an e-mail address for the public. So this is something that gets sense to me and PERSON10 for now. If you would like to respond to this as well then let us know, Otherwise we'll we'll let you know, whatever comes from the public. I don't have.",
            "Here I am. Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So as for the web, there is a section with logos of the partners, and I still haven't received the logos from ORGANIZATION13 and ORGANIZATION12, So I would like to put it there too and also the link for your website, to where you want it to be redirected, so yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we need to polish the ways, this maybe better logos are. Well, it's optimised for the cell phone for now, it seems to me. Yeah. It is like the logos are too big. Yeah. But that's that's not a problem. So, yeah, anyway, we need the logos from you. Ok, thank you. Then there is the PROJECT1 logo. You have seen it in the e-mail, and we have vectorised it and we fused the text priced version now, to create also some versions in bitmap. And we haven't heard from you, so we assume that you liked the logo. If you still had any comments., please say so now or let us know very soon, Otherwise we'll start using the logo on the webpage, We already used it on one presentation in LOCATION1 where the starting OTHER2 projects were introducing themselves to other projects, and so on, So this logo has already appeared to some like limited public, but we still be able to change it. And then, I'll also put the logos to the website, like I mean, the images in the various formats, so that you can start using them in your presentations or the PDFs, that you create and so on. And gradually we should be like building some dissemination ORGANIZATION5, like a set of files that are useful, when you are whenever you are making any public announcements related to PROJECT1. I'll also take the dissemination work package once the project starts, maybe we have been promised to do so. So is. Ok, so now the most important bit for today is the Grant agreements signing. And most of you have done this, and ORGANIZATION12 still have not sign that. I would just like to mention that it is very important to get the signature, well, today or tomorrow, because it is the thirtieth day, which is just the running out for. And the the signi the Grant agreement has to be signed within 30 days since the PERSON13 has circulated to us. So PERSON2, or PERSON8, could you please say the current status, I know that you have talked to the PERSON10 this morning already, so.",
            "Yes, fine.",
            "Please say what's what's the status?",
            "Okay, so, first I want to apologise for the delay, It's just the thing that we are new to such kind of project, And our management team is little bit how can I say that, yeah. They, you know, they want to do everything right, So it is not meant in a bad way or that we don't want to, or that we stop the project, However, it's just the thing that we want to manage everything in a in a right manner, and so therefore we had a lot discussions about Grant agreement, Consortium agree, Consortium agreement, And I just got the e-mail, ten minutes before from my CEO, that when he will when he arrives at the office, which will be around about two o'clock this, or two o'clock p.m. we will sign the Grant agreement, And as I tal spoke with PERSON10, I will also send you email as soon as we've signed everything today. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the next step for us the contract, the Consortium agreement, we with our lawyers at the about the backgrounds and we don't see any problem to sign the Grant agreement, And they really apologise for this, I just want to let you know that it is not meant in a bad way.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you, this is. This is like fine, we were finding us beginning to be anxious. I totally understand your concerns, because I mean, this is like my 4th or 5th project in a row, so I know approximately what is what is happening through all the project and I've seen various problems, that can arise, but I haven't seen any big ones, And all the problems that I ever saw were like easily resolved, but I understand that you don't have this history and this experience, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So whenever you are like anxious about something, I think it is, very important that you ask either me or maybe other partners in the consortium, so ORGANIZATION13 is on a similar status as you are, and they already have successfully participated in one OTHER2 project at least that I know of, maybe there are more. So they would know what is the ways of resolving the various problems and like the, yeah.",
            "It's it's not the thing that lean on me are anxious about this, because well, how can I say that, we understand what's in the Grant agreement. It's more that we have to inform at least two or three people here about the steps about the status of the project and until we got everyone informed, until everyone is on the same page, that's that's sometimes, you know, that takes the time. And that's the case now so I'm totally with you. We always. We all we. You know, we are thinking about how to write this email so that you get a fast next step to our home mangement, but there are still some terms.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We have to inform them and wait for the few decisions.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. So well, hopefully, this will be resolved and I also, yeah, sorry, did you want to say something?",
            "I just said sure, sure.",
            "Yeah, well, okay. And also independently, PERSON10, please, we should make sure that this Grant agreement signing is the forms A. So we should contact our project officer, just to be totally sure that we are handling the process.. Because I said that I have been on many projects in the past, but this is the first I'm coordinating it and there could be like legal or whatever as administrative procedures that I maybe not ever opt, So we we need to be like super cautions with this. So we should we should double check again what forms A are this Grant agreement. I think they are.",
            "Okay.",
            "And, yeah. Yeah, okay. So hopefully why even tonight, the Grant agreement will have been signed by everyone and that would be fabulous. And the other thing that we have to discuss and sign is the Consortium agreement. So this is just reminder that maybe some of you have still not entered the title and name of your legal signatory person in the last pages of the PROJECT1 Consortium agreement. And. So the Consortium agreement, just to let you know do you know what the what the most recent version is. That this is at the top of this document, this CA draft version open thing, You can open that. And it is intended for further commenting and it is the status of the like background of the document as we agreed in our call number two on this. So this is our third call on Consortium agreement and will like valid all your possible comments and resolve them according to what we've agreed during this call. And that will make it a point four version for one more round of a commenting if necessary, But otherwise I think we actually will not need this, I hope that we are already far enough and everybody has had their say, So this oh point four version could be the final one that needs to be sign. It is all between us. So maybe there is not even deadlines, But well we should have it preferably within December so that we know when the project starts, What our mutual relations are and yeah. Okay, so I have already this PROJECT1. -scroll down through this. I wanted to, yeah?",
            "You were out. Can you repeat? There was a gap.",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "And we got lost.",
            "Yeah, so well, I just mentioned that I have this PROJECT1 version open pre-opened as well and we go through the the comments in a second. But I wanted first to like say aloud what we have done in the meantime, because as you know, ORGANIZATION3 is not signing the Consortium agreement, instead ORGANIZATION3 is preparing, oh sorry, bilateral contact contract between us - ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION3. We've already sent this draft to ORGANIZATION3 a week ago, if I am not mistaken, And ORGANIZATION3 is now looking at it. And it essentially contains the mix of things that are in the Grant agreement and Consortium agreement that are relevant for ORGANIZATION3's work in within the project, And we are the the linking point for the whole consortium except ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION3 through the bilateral contract. So it's punwise, it's very nicely organised, it like it's it's good, that both the Consortium agreement and bilateral agreement are in drafts at this point at this point, Because if something needs to be like discussed and then put into both of these contracts it can be easily done. So it has happened that we have through the like working on the on the bilateral agreement. We have figure out that the official status that we've planned for ORGANIZATION3, the affiliated entity, is not like legaly appropriate. So the way that I was presenting it in the last call was that the ORGANIZATION3 will be our affiliated entity to get access to our results and test them in their meetings and the congress. And it turns out that this status cannot be used, So it's nice that we could have easily proposed a new name, a new status, partially participating entities and ORGANIZATION3 will get this one, that's the proposal, and so like effectively nothing is changing, it's only like relabelling, But it's important that this true documents are consistent with the with the label. And the access rights for affiliated entities that are previously in the Consortium agreement are now duplicated there. One version is for the affiliated entities, but that's not applicable, this copy is porch 9.5.1. and it's unchanged original as it was in the in the desktop template for this Consortium agreement and the second copy is 9.5.2. and that's access rights for partially participating entities, And this is modified in the way that we've discussed in the previous call, are actually in the e-mails afterwards. We proposed that ORGANIZATION3 will have royalty-free access to the results of our project, to all the translation systems, the minuting tools, whatever, during the project lifetime so during the project lifetime and fair and reasonable conditions after the project lifetime. And this is justified by the fact that we want ORGANIZATION3 to be the test partner, essentially as a full partner in the project, except that they are not signing the Consortium agreement so they are not a full partner, But we want to give them the same access as every partner has. And after the project has ended all the various institutions in the consortium will have various costs associated with running the services. This is. If we really something in the open source, well ORGANIZATION3 can download it and use it on their own, But most of the things that we will have developed will not be of this of this type, I believe, and it will be rather services running on the various clusters of the various institutes. And in that case it is important that like ORGANIZATION3, as everybody else, every other possible user of the services, will pay their the reasonable price for running this. So this is the main change. Formally, it's a new status, new name - partially participating entity. And contentwise it is what we have proposed in the in the email. So I would like to check now whether everybody is happy with this with this new set-up. Or if you have any comments? I know that ORGANIZATION5, who are not on the call, are fine with this. Yeah, so that's that's good. I don't hear any complaints from you, yeah. So, now. This was the most important point and honestly I don't remember what other points were there. Yes, so let's let's not browse the version 0\\. 3 of the the Consortium agreement. So you see that you see that we have created one more attachment Identified Partially Participating Entities according to section 9.5.2. And this is this is where ORGANIZATION3 appears, So ORGANIZATION3 no longer appears as the affiliated entity. Then, yes, so hopefully, this was a comment by ORGANIZATION3, that the exploitation. I think, this was just a misunderstanding, So I hope that ORGANIZATION3 will now resolve this comment.",
            "Yeah, sure. It was covered by the thing you talked about before. That was.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That was it. So.",
            "Ok. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so just, please, clickresolve so that we're done, if you can? If you cannot I can do it for you. And then we have received some edits or proposed edits from ORGANIZATION5's lawyer and essentially. But these are labeled as anonymous and they happened on the December of on the 6th of December. And I don't think these edits are like affecting anyone in any way. It's just some refinement of the wording, So my plan is to sign the except all of all of these. Please review them today or so. If you find any problem please let us immediately, But I don't think there is anything dangerous in these edits by the anonymous. Yeah, so another thing was that we didn't like the grammatically the edit by ORGANIZATION2 lawyer, So I'd like. If they are fine, the ORGANIZATION2 lawyers could double check that, like we reject and go back to what was there before, If we can do this please confirm that. I hope that I'm not misunderstanding something some intention, some intentional change here. I think it was just bad editing or unfortunate editing of the created sentence so if ORGANIZATION2 could double check with their lawyers.",
            "We can do that, yes.",
            "Yeah, thank you. And then, what else do we have? This. Yes, this is, we're. So, if anybody. But that's not planned. If anybody should become the same should obtain the same status ORGANIZATION3 has, to become the partially participating entity, then this will be discussed by the Project Coordination Committee where everybody has their vote. So, this is just the same way as the other special status entities. Then this is nothing special, this is just like PERSON10 has PERSON10's the project administrator, so project management office, that's that's PERSON10. Then, yeah. So, the Project Ethics Committee, this is something that we don't have to discuss today at all, but, please, remember that shortly after the project start, we'll have to appoint the Project Ethics Committee. So think about people who would be respectable and would have the time to serve on our Ethics Committee and here is what they are expected to do. So please search for candidates. It's it's not that every partner needs to have someone there, quite the contrary, it's three to five members in total and half of them are separate like outside from outside of the project, So we need people outside of the project to help us. Then. This is this is from ORGANIZATION5. In planned patent application no co-owner will grant any licence to a third party before the first filing of a patent. That seems reasonable. So this is exactly what I say, I plan to accept all these edits by anonymous from the 6th. And this is. -all Parties committed for dissemination, fair distribution of opportunities to publish, the copyright,. It's it all seems like just refining what is natural. So there is some change - the objecting party publication delay of not more than 60 days,, okay. Do you have any opinion on the delay? So all this is act 5. Dissemination of own results. It's own dissemination, an objection is justified if the production. During the project for a period of a 1 year after. The dissemination of own results by one or several parties, shall be governed by procedure of the Grant agreement, Which is that you'll have to notify and that is also which we are like softening. Prior notice shall be given at least 45 calendar days before the publication. This is, I thought that this was this was resolved. Well, let's not look at it now, for the sake of our plan. But everybody, please, check this. Here we are deliberately on the soft grounds of. We can allow there is this. Dissemination results, yeah, we have this 11.9, Where we reduce the requirement to notify everybody for the five days before publishing, that they want publish, And we reduce this if everybody's totally sure that no one is patenting things. So, then this is related to this 7. where was that. This is related to it's 8, sorry, the dissemination, 8.4. or 8.5. And this is where people file objections against the publication that has been made. So and then what ORGANIZATION5 is changing is they're changing the number of days until one people can complain. Well, so, simply let's try to avoid these conflicts altogether. If you are publishing something and you are and that you have some concern then that everybody would like to patent it, please, talk to them before you publish. And also, if you are planning to patent something, please, indicate that everybody should ask before they're publishing anything related, So that we avoid these problems. And hopefully if we do if you all follow these like sensible procedures and take these precautions, hopefully, there will be no difference in in 90 or 60 days of filing an objection altogether. So I'm probably fine with accepting these edits as well. But, please, everybody have a look at that if you find some other problems. Yeah. So, there is again. -continuous investigation concerning possible third parties rights are not expected. Yeah, that's true. Access rights for internal research and educational issues shall be granted for. Yeah, yeah. Subject to a separate written agreement. Yeah, access rights, yeah. So this is also related to what ORGANIZATION3 has. So we have agreed and will come to that in shortly what we get to the to the partially participating parties in the project, But this is this is also the same situation where the regular partners are in. If you want to use, other party's results for the exploitation of your own results. So for example, if I'm if I'm starting to sell my machine translation system and I link it, with the with the speech recognition from ORGANIZATION5, I need. First it will be done on fair and reasonable conditions and second, I need to have a separate written agreement with ORGANIZATION5 so that they allow me to use their system. This is natural and it's it's like it is it is not for the project purposes, it's it's outside of the project purposes, it's for some additional exploitation of my own results. So, just make sure that to to follow this and I think I'm I'm happy to accept this proposal by ORGANIZATION5. Yeah. Let's let's move on and we will get to the. Yeah, we're we're there. So this is the access rights for affiliated entities, Originally it was access rights for affiliated entities in one section 9.5, now it's two sections 9.5.1 which is the unchanged original wording and it has a fair and reasonable conditions during the project as well as after the project. And here for partially participating entities, that's 9.5.2, that's a second copy of that paragraph, And it is it is written just for ORGANIZATION3, essentially, so ORGANIZATION3 is listed down there and in the attachment. And it says that the partially participating entities should be granted upon written bilateral agreement, royalty free access to the results of the project during the project lifetime and on fairly reasonable conditions after the end of the project. So I'm highlighting this is \"upon written bilateral agreement\", I've tried to get rid of this additional layer of like a paperwork, But I think it's in the end, it would be more complicated than I thought it it could be. And in the end I believe it is it is sensible to have like a written report of what we are giving to ORGANIZATION3 for the various tests and would be various situations, well, when they'll test our PROJECT1 results. So it should be. We will try to make this process very simple, as simple as possible, but still for every occasion where ORGANIZATION3 will need some of our results we will have a written note on that that everybody will sign and confirm. And and hopefully the first note, the first agreement, will be so general that it will work for most of the situations, And the later refinements of this if some other tools or new versions of the tools will be developed, like substantially new and not only retrain models, then another bill threat, we ment, will be will be covered that. So, well. We don't have the forms for this, like the \"template\" of the agreement prepared yet, We'll prepare it later on as the project runs, But, essentially it will be man bilateral agreements between ORGANIZATION3 and all the all the contributing parties from the project signing maybe the same document and this will be the formal written thing. So just keep this keep this in mind that we need some. -seems like a full stop, so I'll change the full stop. No, it is not a full stop, it is a space. I don't think, it's strange. Ok. So this is just the little word of warning that there will be some paperwork associated with ORGANIZATION3 getting our results, But we'll try to keep this minimal. Ok. And if I'm not mistaken, there won't be any other changes like bigger ones. Again this is this is the refinements by the ORGANIZATION5. So please everybody go through them. This. I have no idea what this means. But again, it's it's what works for ORGANIZATION5 in their past consortium agreements, so there is. It is probably based on experience that. And we are now at the section of signatures. So we see our template, ORGANIZATION2 has not filled who will be signing this and then ORGANIZATION5 has not filled who will be signing, We know from ORGANIZATION13, that's great. We don't know of from ORGANIZATION10 and that's it because there is no there is no signature from ORGANIZATION3 here. Here is the background so, please, review the background again, but it's it should be completed. And maybe this is the thing that, that ORGANIZATION12 might like to like discuss with the lawyers again. Yeah. So, please, propose changes to this document and let us know. And please do it very quickly, because I would really like to close the content of the Consortium agreement. And as you see here is the standard form if we are adding one more party which we are planning, Simplified transfer. This is something standard in the agreement. I don't really know, what it is for. There i there are no identified affiliated entities according to 5.1. But there is identified partially participating entities, according to 9.5.2. and that's the ORGANIZATION3. So that's that's it. So I know that ORGANIZATION5 is happy with the kind wording as it is proposed. I hope that everybody who has survived this browsing is happy too. If you want to, please, have your lawyers look at the little changes by ORGANIZATION5, again. But I don't think, that you will find anything problematic. And please enter the name of the person who will be signing this, And we should get to signing very soon. It is Christmas, So as a Christmas gift having the Consortium agreement signed by everyone would be it would be a great thing. Ok, any comments? No. If not, then. So there then there are few more items in the agenda and they are not to critical anymore, But let me quickly go over them. So as you know, we are running the Pre-Dry Run for our technology at the Students Firms Fair. This is something that we are organising, and with the help of ORGANIZATION5 and and ORGANIZATION13 with their technologies. ORGANIZATION5 is even considering to come for the March event. It's the high school students, they'll be presenting in OTHER3 and OTHER1, and we would like to test the subtitling technology in like life, and to see, what all problems there will be. So far are we have not talked to ORGANIZATION2 in detail about this and we don't think they will need any bare help for for this event to happen, But if ORGANIZATION2 would like to join this Pre-Dry Run then, please, let us know what you would like you to do what you like to test at this at this event. For me, the main reason is to test what quality of OTHER1 ASR we will be able to develop until March with the tools that are already out there and with the data that we'll we'll collect. And also to see what the integration platform looks like and wha-t what all the rough edges could be. Yeah. So for. I do not think that ORGANIZATION2 needs to test anything on their own, because there are already linked with the ORGANIZATION13 platform, we are not, so that's why we need this. The only thing that I like urgently need, but ORGANIZATION5 is not here, so maybe ORGANIZATION2 could provide me with the details instead, is the pointers to the toolkits that are used to train ASR models, because we need to build an ASR model for OTHER1. And also we need the integration, so that's one more thing. Details on the protocol with the ORGANIZATION13 platform to link OTHER1 MT to ORGANIZATION13 platform. Yeah. So PERSON5. If you could send me the details of what should we what should our machine translation system be connecting to, please do so as soon as possible. I have the student to work on this, but he's also new to the various other things. So the sooner he knows, what he needs the better.",
            "Hi, I was due the information.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Say, hopefully, by the end of this week.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok?",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok, thank you. And if ORGANIZATION2 knows what ORGANIZATION5 uses or what is a good tool kit for new network speech recognition, please let me know as well. So I know that ORGANIZATION5 has the has released their SLT.KIT tool kit. And that uses various things, and but they mentioned that it is not good for the online speech translation. So maybe if you use something better, please let us know. So, so far, we are just looking at this. Alright then. So far, ORGANIZATION1 is.",
            "I fairly don't know, what ORGANIZATION5 is using right now.",
            "And what you are using?",
            "For speech recognition PERSON1, that's momentary.",
            "Ok, but PERSON1 is not new, so, yeah, do you use something else?",
            "I think. Well, ocassionally. We've had discussions in if that for project, that's training speech recognition systems PERSON1 is a lot more complicated training NT system. So the speech grou here don't I know really, they don't really -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Requireable systems.",
            "I don't think, use your network for this, it's it's adaptable software, that's all I know. But we don't really know,",
            "Ok, yeah. So.",
            "We used to build these systems, but we don't know what ORGANIZATION5 uses.",
            "So we have to we have to get this information from ORGANIZATION5, okay? Yeah. Thank you. So then the other point is the first workshop like the real Dry Run, not the Pre-Dry Run. The workshop in the year one will take place on the premises of ORGANIZATION3 here in LOCATION2 and it would be at the end of June. So this there will be about twenty participants from eight countries, And this will be very similar to what I have seen what they had already done with the ORGANIZATION15 company in November. The language of the workshop is OTHER3. So they actually do not need us and that's good. But we want to translate it into many languages. So as soon as the project starts we'll discuss how to handle this. Who would be like who would like to come for the event if the that is needed. It will be our second try already, so hopefully the the critical problems will be already resolved there on March in the Pre-Dry Run set-up. So the thing. This is this is to be discuss, but I think, that we should focus on designing the mixing of materials and subtitles in the selected language, or s or on some other way of reducing the cognitive load for the participants. So the main observation, aside from all the technical refinements, that ORGANIZATION3 has already made in November, was that it is impossible to follow the slides on the overhead projector and look at the translated subtitles in your selected language on your cell phone. So, this mixing of materials and subtitles is something that we need to like design the user interface for. So, this is for maybe ORGANIZATION13 to think if their publication platform can also support some like presenting of slides, or, copying of screens from the ov the main overhead projector, so that it mixes at the users device, or what are the options. With this is this is totally open. We are not obliged to do this in any particular way. We should we should just make the experience for the participant good. So this is as I mentioned this is what what ORGANIZATION15 has already tested. Okay. And then there are already some details on the main event, the ORGANIZATION7 Congress. So I asked PERSON10 if she could create the ORGANIZATION14 calendar for PROJECT1 events in general, and enter all the details.",
            "Hello?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "You froze again, at least for me, not sure how -",
            "Okay.",
            "We have lost you.",
            "Yeah, ok. So, is it better now?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, I, hope it is, so, so.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, yeah. So I was just saying that we know the details for the Congress from ORGANIZATION3 already. It's the Congress will take place at the end of May and early June in 2020. And the plenary meetings will be held in the new building of the ORGANIZATION4 which is the old building of the Parliament of the communist era and it was also the ORGANIZATION8 building after the Velvet revolution shortly. And the workshops will be not far from that, but still, it's like one tram stop from there, at the ORGANIZATION16 in their new building. There will be fifty countries represented up to two hundred and fifty participants. The program is divided so that on one day they are in the ORGANIZATION8 building, On a day two they are in the in the workshop building, And there could be up to twelve and very likely ten simultaneously running workshops, and each workshops had a topic, and we could have and we should have one to one topic one workshop on next language processing and machine translation services. So we still have plenty of time to prepare this, but we should keep that in mind. And each workshop will have two copies or instances, one taking place in the morning and one in the afternoon, so that people could attend so that people could avoid conflicts in the workshops and more people would learn to what the workshop offers. And then there will be two more days plenary in the ORGANIZATION8 building. So, there will be some input in advance. So hopefully ORGANIZATION3 will be successful in collecting slides and notes from the speakers, at least a week in advance, or maybe more. And ORGANIZATION3 reminded me that this is different style of presentations from the presentations that we know from our conferences. This is. Usually these presentations are written by someone else and not the main person, who is presenting officially. So actually 80 percent of the delivered speech is directly from the notes. And this is this is good for us. So we should think about ways of making use of these materials. And we should have our pipeline ready to be able to integrate this like on the spot additional input. So, I know that, I am planning something for the year 2020, but remember, these goals in the research that you are going to do in the in the coming months of PROJECT1. So that we can then just find the solutions easily, when we need them. And ORGANIZATION3 want's to have some fallback solutions, because the quality of the translation has to be excellent. So they will they now confirmed, that there will be regular interpreters for major languages, And we principally could use them as re-speakers. There will be five booths and five interpreters running all the time for the plenary session. And all the participants should get all the slides translated in advance to browse them if everything else fails. So if if there is like a total failure of wi-fi, of everything of, well, electricity has to be there. But if anything beyond electricity is broken, then they should be at least able to browse the translated slides. It is yet to be discussed, even at ORGANIZATION3 internally, if these translations of the slides and materials are expected to post-edit or not. And for us, within PROJECT1 we don't have the like a strict obligation to do the service, but we are doing the documenteral translation, So it could be nice test case for us. And if it is nice test case for us, then we'll have to find someone who will handle the the file formats. So in the worst case. This is what we have discussed with PERSON14 when we were already writing the proposal. So in the worst case I think that we can like live with some pptx and and docx file formats which is generally xml. And if they are not to ugly we can replace the strings with a edel tex with the eximal tex. So as as a fallback solution, we can handle it. But if you had someone who'll be more interested in the handling formats and who would have the processors ready that would be very useful. ORGANIZATION2 could have links to the mat to the Made capture project and that is realy well supported in terms of formats as I've seen. So maybe that would be one option. Another option would be that we somehow split this with ORGANIZATION15. So my way of thinking about ORGANIZATION15 is that they could handle the file formats for ORGANIZATION3. And we could feed it we could support it with our machine translation engines. But I have not. So far I have I have suggested this to ORGANIZATION15, but I was not really successful at persuading them to do the file formats processing. Ok. So these are other notes. I don't know if you have any other comments to this or not. Yeah. And then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "-have any access to file format conversion to use right now. So it would be great if ORGANIZATION15 take that for us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's let's keep that in mind. Let's keep convincing them when we see them around our Kick-off meeting. I'll keep that in mind, I'll do that regularly. I'll also like seek for students, who could to do this, And I'll also check if anything on the file formats is available as open source from the ORGANIZATION17. I understand, that you are not familiar with that is with the internals of ORGANIZATION17. So, if you happen to get that information, please let me know, that would save my time. Yeah, okay. The last thing that is on us only for this for this ORGANIZATION8 building. There should be an PROJECT1 booth somewhere in the in the lobby or in the corridors, So this is this is something, that we'll have to prepare like draw. There is plenty of time for this. And the the conflict that should be discussed is that ORGANIZATION15 also wants to try the Congress. So one possible division is along the days. So some of the days could be covered by the ORGANIZATION15 technology and some could be covered by the PROJECT1 technology. And if we don't come up with any better solution or better integration of these two services then this is probably sensible way to go. So keep thinking about this and we can discuss this for the first time when we talk to ORGANIZATION15 in person. And we still have plenty of time, before the actual Congress comes so all the all the tools will develop until then and we'll see. Okay. So this was this was everything from my side. I hope that I have not forgotten ever anything. And I am curious, if you have any other comments from your sides. Well, if not, then it's excellent planning, it was one hour exactly, it was not meant to be so. But it we just ended up like that. Please, let me know as soon as possible, if there anything that you don't like about the current Consortium agreement. And if I don't hear from you, we'll finalise it by the end of this week, so that we have the last week before Christmas break to do the signing, then. So, if possible, finalise the consortio your opinion on the Consortium agreement early this week and let us let us finalise it for everyone at the end of this week. So that's it. So if there are no product comments, no questions. We are here for you, and thank you very much. And I'm not sure, if we'll make another call. So if we don't speak to each other in person before Christmas, then have a good celebration and peaceful time toward the end of the year, but we'll be surely that by email, and hopefully by also with these signatures, and all the things. Okay, thank you.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Happy Christmas and, yeah, thank you. And bye.",
            "Wish you the same. And bye. Bye.",
            "Ok, bye."

And then, right now I'm working on adaptation of the ORGANIZATION8 common voice ASR. So for that I don't have the results yet. But then I have access to system that I've been partly involved in development and its has like 32 percent work error rate, so it's like the best so far. Maybe PERSON6, is is there some like what is like the baseline of the ORGANIZATION7 ASR?",
            "I don't know. I haven't evaluated work error rate on ASR. Only the of PROJECT3.",
            "This is something that we, it's o, can you can you also give PERSON6, can you give the outputs of ORGANIZATION7 ASR to PERSON3, so that PERSON3 would evaluate it as well? In a comparable way?",
            "Yes. Sure.",
            "Yeah, that that will be, that will be good because, yeah. To to have some comparison with the ORGANIZATION7 ASR. Yeah, so I, yeah I don't have much hope to get below like 25 percents of work error rate. But.",
            "That would be probably very good.",
            "Yeah, like maybe around 30. I I'm still trying some adaptation so like, yeah. I should have them in a, like tomorrow or.",
            "Yeah. Can can you give the outputs of your ASR systems the 60 percent and the 30 percent to PERSON6 already? So that we can proceed with this and see that in principle we can get to the to the outputs with this ASR?",
            "Yeah. Sure, so after the call I will like send the path on a cluster to these texts.",
            "Yeah, I forgot to ask PERSON3. Can you process ORGANIZATION9 ASR or ORGANIZATION10 ASR? And. And optain.",
            "Yeah, I have processed ORGANIZATION9 ASR.",
            "Yeah, and could you do ORGANIZATION10?",
            "Ok, I can, I can have a look into that. I have not done it but yeah.",
            "I think so so someone must have done it some. I think for that someone, and I thought it was you PERSON3, did it for the last Antrecorp.",
            "I I've done it for ORGANIZATION9, not ORGANIZATION10.",
            "And not for ORGANIZATION10? Are you sure? Ok, well. So I think we had ORGANIZATION10 there as well.",
            "Maybe not.",
            "I I don't think so. I think just the ORGANIZATION5 ASR, ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION9.",
            "Yeah, ok. So we could again, actually we could again ask the the ORGANIZATION5 people, PERSON8. Because they are from ORGANIZATION5, they are not on the project but they could also run their ASR systems if it's easy for them. So PERSON3, did you, were you in touch with them directly or not?",
            "You mean for this challenge or for the.",
            "For the Antrecorp. Those, those year ago or more.",
            "I think you wrote an e-mail to PERSON8 ask. But, yeah, I can maybe do it, if you want to.",
            "Yeah, yeah please try, because the more systems we have, the better, the better we know like what are the important and useful aspects of those systems.",
            "Yeah, I think I can provide like 3 word error rate right now for three different systems.",
            "Yeah, that's great.",
            "Yep.",
            "Thank you.",
            "In worst case I can use translate dot it. To get the ASR but it's not, it's not online. I can't get it online, but offline it works. It seems that the session stops after 5 minutes, but at least something will be there.",
            "Hmm-hmm. Yeah, thank you. And the last involved person is PERSON9.",
            "Hi.",
            "Yeah. So what was the, what was the horrible thing that you spotted. This, I do.",
            "Yeah, I've I've found out that the, that the check point I've been training of was actually trained on several other data sets. Like.",
            "Yeah, that's not a problem. That's ok. Yes, that's ok.",
            "It's ok?",
            "Yes. The only thing is that we have to know what was in the training data. And if we do more, then we will simply label our submission as unconstrained. So that's, don't worry at all, it's ok to use unconstrained systems. All these commercial ones, like ORGANIZATION9 and so on, these will be unconstrained as well.",
            "Oh, ok, so then there is nothing horrible, I think. I actually don't. Sorry? Go ahead.",
            "Sorry I just wanted to ask if probably we should not use the Antrecorp test sets, right?",
            "Yes, exactly. Yeah.",
            "For training.",
            "But there was not used.",
            "Ok, ok, yeah, thanks.",
            "Ok, so PERSON9, when do you expect to have the outputs from your system, just the ASR into graphimes and ASR into fonimes ready?",
            "By today evening I guess.",
            "Yeah. Tonight, I would call it raw ASR outputs should be ready. And the thing is that this will not be segmented. So for the graphime level, someone needs to run the segmentor and then the translation. So PERSON6 is that part of your pipeline, can you easily run the segmentor.",
            "Which segmentor?",
            "Any. So so, it, so is it lower case or is it actually capitalized, PERSON9?",
            "I will try both.",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "So.",
            "It's better if you process, process it with segmentor, PERSON9. Because it will be easier for me. But I can do it, if you fail on it. And we need to finish the review of the segmentor with PERSON14, anyway.",
            "Yeah. So as, PERSON14 was on on the call as well, right? Yes. So simply you 3 synchronize whoever will process the the files. And just be very careful because like now, this applies to PERSON3 as well. Start also like writing the the paper and in the paper, in the comments of the paper, so that it's not visible then in the PDF. But make sure to include full path so that we know, if we have a system with this beautiful name in the paper, it is actually this output from this directory created by this person and so on. When people are like moving the the file from one another then it's very easy to mess things up and forget which system was used for what. So use the paper right away as the like synchronization point. So that you know which ASR and which PROJECT3 together form the best output. So the versioning, ORGANIZATION12 versioning is a critical thing now.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, so I'll simply write that. PERSON9, PERSON6 and PERSON14 should synchronize on segmenting PERSON9's outputs. So PERSON9 is also like struggling to to run his experiments for his the, his thesis. So I I asked him primarily to run the ASR and not to spend too much time with the segmentor. And I hope the running of the segmentor can be easily done by PERSON14 or PERSON6, so that like. There is no way to to polish the segmentor to retrain it or least, at least. I would try to have a baseline run now and only if we have extra time then then like let's work on improving things. But let's let's aim just for the combination of the things at the moment.",
            "So I think I already trained an English segmentor earlier, during the month of January and probably that could be -",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, so like from my point of view, this looks so far very promising. Because we have the baseline it's by PERSON6, last week, it's very bad but it's it is some baseline. We have now 2 more or 3 more systems by PERSON3 and maybe a fourth one coming soon as well. With PERSON9 it's also not lost at all. There is a big chance that we'll have some outputs. And putting it together by the end of the week and including the machine translation system should be doable. So, I think that it's, obviously, this is a hard task, don't expect great scores. But as like as an experiment, as a submission to a hard task I think we're doing very good. So the, I just wanted to finish the fonime. S, for output will be even harder to segment. So if this is too hard give it up. But. Yeah. But please try. So I've talked with PERSON9 for little while on this and we we have 2 options but, yeah. Let's let's not go in to the details at the moment, ok? So that was the most important part for me now and we have, how many people do we have. 2, 4, 6, 9, and we have PERSON15 as well. But I don't think that the connection would be good. PERSON15, can you hear us? No, it doesn't really work. So I wanted to ask what is the status of the fourth alignment, like word level golden data for edible SLT, but I'll leave that to to some later discussion. Yeah. I I see that PERSON14 also like everybody is is struggling to get to to the hairdresser. You've taken the the simple road. It's like, we, everybody is gets like a monk exercise.",
            "Story brand, so actually I started training using that trimmer and was completely. So I had to shave with sh razor blade.",
            "Razor, oh I saw that you, that you waited for for day with.",
            "Yeah, that didn't happen to me but I didn't kind of set the, set the thing correctly so so that I had to set it to completely the lower, lowest option, so it was like 1 centimeter or something.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Well don't don't worry, the quarantine will will last much longer than your hair will need to grow to some normal lenght anyway. It's crazy. Ok, so now let's let's very quickly go over all all the contributions to document that we have made so far. So I've found, well I I've realized that there is ORGANIZATION12 corp. A big corpus which is manually created and it should become the basis of the PROJECT5 test set for most languages but some languages are still missing. It's good to like keep returning to something which should have been ready. So the set of languages that we should cover, well actually one was forgotten. So one was forgot and not 2, I later found out that Bulgarian was not forgotten but Catalan was forgotten on the list. And workshop to the PROJECT5 test set, this is something that, yeah, I'm just trying to make sure that we do not loose our data anywhere behind. Yeah, so that's that's it. I'm again mainly organizing and pushing people to to do what they promised to do or what I would like them to do. Yeah, so PERSON7, are on the call or not? I'm not sure. Maybe PERSON7. No, PERSON7 is not here. That's the file collector. Oh, ok, yeah, I'll fix that. We'll work on stream lining, the file conversion and pipeline, yes. So the domain adaptation is is like the talk level domain adaptation is soon to be more less automated, thanks to PERSON7 and hopefully we will see the pipeline ready in in a fe week from now perhaps. Yeah, then PERSON6, so, you have already mentioned that you are working on the PROJECT3 wrapper and the online text flow. I know that some student of mine was struggling with the compilation or installation of online text flow and I've told him that that you have suceeded and you have maybe fix it in the repository as well. So that's good thing. And yes, this is, I've seen the issue, it's good to to debug thing so, everything we do just being active and using the tools that we are developing. We are doing the critical test they need to to go through and otherwise they would not be reliably enough for for the final user. Ok. Do you want to add anything PERSON6?",
            "No, but but also our workers have the same issue. They.",
            "Ok.",
            "By batch I suppose.",
            "Yeah. So this is something that also PERSON14 has to make sure with you that's, they are like resilient to to big batches.",
            "But, but usually it doesn't happen in real sessions, only in only in.",
            "Offline set up or.",
            "Yes, or if you send 20 sentences at once.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some high number as, I think it has never happened in field.",
            "Yeah. I think it can happen if for example for due to network lag too much content could get accumulated.",
            "Yes.",
            "Could that happen? Yeah. And then implement SLT if output format option for PROJECT3 wrapper. Yes. Yeah, so that's, this is something which is like related to what PERSON14 has for his runs.",
            "Yes, but I'm going to change the the protocol of output and see. So the previous solution won't be, can't be used anymore.",
            "Yeah, ok. So that's just keep PERSON14 informed so that we know how to.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, thank you. And then reimplement the even the automatic evaluation scores, right? So that's primarily the lag and.",
            "And flicker.",
            "Flicker, yeah. Ok. And revalidate means like measure again.",
            "Yes.",
            "The scores. Yes. And also push everybody to contribute to the paper. Sorry.",
            "Ok. I will work need to start first, write a graph.",
            "Yeah, wh I think we have created the the Github, sorry the overleaf already, right?",
            "Yes. But it's empty.",
            "Yeah. So as I said this this should be the synchronization point for everybody. To put full paths to the outputs and so on.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you. Yeah, we've discussed all the previous points already. So now PERSON14, preparation of locks for dry run, including the pre-run and dry run too, yes. So it's it's good that you have found out where where they are and maybe some of the were already processed by humans as well, right?",
            "I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah, PERSON11 did that, PERSON11 did that. His part but not everyone transcripts.",
            "Yeah. So this is something that, yeah, who is the most reliable person. I think, so please synchronize with PERSON1. Because he knows what he has given to the annotators. And the agreement at one of these dry run sessions was that some people will do it for themselves but some people, such as me, I said that I would like the annotators to do it. And that's that's the plan. We, like we have the funding, it's ok to do it with the help of annotators. What just we must avoid is doing the same thing twice.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So please synchronize so, PERSON14 should sync with PERSON1 to make sure that all is done exactly once.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, ok. Simple script for PERSON13 in cruise control. So that means the deployment or running the workers on our set up, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, thank you. And working on Czech segmentor. Base on pause durations, ok, that's good. That would be usefull. And I would just like to hear from you that you are still kind of free so that I can ask the student to contact you with the help for the. Because this, there used to be 2 students, but one of them is is now back in home country. And it'll be good if if he could contact you.",
            "Yeah, ok, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, thank you. And the polishing of set up there is, yes that's, yeah, that that can be done at any point the sooner the better for us, but yeah. Then PERSON15 tested data in desk set and test set, put the results in the ORGANIZATION9 sheet. So, yes, this is, this is the completion of edible SLT. And and I'll need to check separately like how far is that. And then PERSON12, do we have PERSON12 on the call?",
            "Yes, yes, I'm on.",
            "Yeah, ok. So can you very quickly say what what you have work on?",
            "Yesterday I mention you I have, I clean the tested data on for 21 ORGANIZATION2 languages European website. And it is also converted in PSV format, but in the some sales, there are blank values so, and and some inverted comas. So I will remove e maybe a maybe tonight. So I after that I will upload on the Github but before uploading I. Should I remove or directly? I create one curie.",
            "The Polish?",
            "Yes. Not not, Polish, actually I have created separate directory in the Github. And test minus E and minus B and in that directory I have uploaded all the test, oh one test that's it. So, because a in the last week we discuss we will upload only, we will up, we will create port of European directory and in that directory we share all the multilingual type data. So, but I'm confused before uploading I will remo I should remove the direc Git for that?",
            "So, please create there one new subdirectory in the documents, that would, like with the document there will be the ORGANIZATION1. And the other files which are already there, and that belong to this collection from the ORGANIZATION1, should not be like, there should not be a second copy of those files. I don't think that anyone has worked on them. But please check. So that's why we have the repository. Because you would see who has done any edits to those files and that's that's it.",
            "Ok. So ok I will do that.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Yeah, and next is, ok, I have also downloaded the PROJECT1 as you shared with me the link. And it is already available in the mine local directory.",
            "Ok, how big is that and how many languages does it cover?",
            "5 languages we have.",
            "Oh just 5 ok.",
            "And in 1 languages I change, ok just give me second. Ok, I will check. Each directory has 95 point, ok. So I think 200, 2000 keys sentences something. So in in English to Spanish directory.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will put is accurate a statistics in this fol file.",
            "Yeah, so, if it's just 5 languages it's not too important. So so this is actually more important, yeah, sorry I. Just second. So, let's let's put this mainly to our training data and not to the PROJECT5 test set. That's what I wanted to say. But we don't have the organization of the test, of the training data yet. So this is something that you should create on the disc, not version, because this will be bigger files.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Actually I have already mention in the SL data sets my database structure were easy in the language. So I the statistics.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you.",
            "And, where is the my, ok, this is the and my to do list is mono data for, mono data and prepare test set for rest of the languages except ORGANIZATION2 language.",
            "Yeah, ok. So.",
            "Maybe I would, I just I just checked the PROJECT1 on the internet and I just have, I just have one like idea. That I have been checking the the websites of the ORGANIZATION4 and I actually noticed that everything that they publish is in all the languages. So maybe is could also be used as a, I don't know, there is really lot of data in in like German, French and Italian, so maybe that could be interesting for for some kind of corpus.",
            "Ok, ok I have it check. Can you send me link, if you have, website name.",
            "Yeah, I will, I will send you the link and maybe you can, you can make use of that.",
            "Ok.",
            "Sorry, I was absent for for second. And remember, we will be cut sharp at quarter to 5, so.",
            "So I think I have done my part. Maybe. If you have any question. So after to, to what is the name, PERSON10?",
            "Yeah, yeah. Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegri, yes. And als so, this will be when you have the TSV files for her to review.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "And also I would like you to for the twenty one languages, for the ORGANIZATION6 files, not to finish, not to stop when you have the TSV files in the Github repository, but actually to go forward and find the annotators who will process this.",
            "Ok.",
            "So it's important that we move to this like the, this this the preporitory like the preprocessing stage and from the preprocessing stage we still need to do the step to the for the validation. And it is, this is also for you to to like distribute the work to the people.",
            "Ok.",
            "So talk to PERSON18, she will probably know, so, PERSON12 should contact PERSON18 to double check who has an agreement finish and is like waiting for work.",
            "PERSON18 has already with, I got an e-mail on.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So. So that's 4 days ago so that's up to date.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so then PERSON12 should start contacting people then.",
            "Ok.",
            "Each of the validators. So this is exactly what I said that you need stream line including the communication with the people. Because it's now 21 languages, if you do like 21 times 2 or 3, that would be 60 e-mails easily to get the job started, that's too many. So you need to make it simple, so that you don't have to send 60 individual e-mails.",
            "Ok.",
            "You really need to, you need, you really need to make this efficient.",
            "Sure, I will try to figure out how to easily do, because I have to some workshop proceeding editing,, some workshop proceeding.",
            "It has to really has to be like low, like low amount of work. Nothing individual. So.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "I think that.",
            "Yeah, thanks. Remember to keep me in the in the carbon company if I see any options for other optimization of the process and I would let you know.",
            "Sure.",
            "Thank you. And then we have last one PERSON4. So you're still struggling with the multilingual system, right?",
            "Yes, so I'm, I'm just trying to integrate into the mediator, because like I have some, I had to make s make some adjustment to to to simply processing so I will need to just edit the scripts a bit. And then I have started trying to improve the performance. And I'm trying using different type perimeters, so I will see how that goes.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So there is one thing that I wanted to mention and that is that our project officer has ask for demo. And this demo should be as multilingual as possible. And I think that right now you have the the largest model. Actually larger model than ORGANIZATION5 has. So what, by when would you would you expect that this model would be reliably operating.",
            "I'm not sure I. I hope that it should be this week. I'm I'm just not sure how it will operate on the KPU. But it should be alright.",
            "Ok, so you're so far using only the TPUs, right?",
            "Yes. I'm I'm using it on the TPU, but I still have the TPU available. So perhaps I can just, you know run.",
            "Connect directly from TPUs.",
            "To the mediator, maybe.",
            "This is kind of risky. It is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but I I think it shouldn't be a problem really.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So basically, it is running on the TPU in the paraphrasing server so it's fine.",
            "Ok.",
            "I just hope that it there won't be any problems in in on the cluster.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So please, talk to PERSON14 and make, like ideally the deployment should happen twice at the same time. At our GPU machines by PERSON14 and or you as well, like with the help of PERSON14. And on the TPU as as a kind of fallback, but I would not I would not like if if the TPU was the only solution for the.",
            "Yeah, I don't think that, I don't think that I will need to to use it on the TPU because it it's already running on paraphrasing server without any problems so it should be fine.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "On the GPU.",
            "Yeah, ok. So I'll I'll have to send response to the project officer and I'll tell him that we would like to do the demo after the edible SLT which is the 20th or the 24th for the paper. So it would really be good if so. If it didn't look good in, if you were struggling to get it running by the end of this week, please, let me know. Otherwise let's plan to have the demo like on the 23rd or something like that.",
            "Ok, also, also I don't know about the performance on some of the languages because for some of the languages we have only very little data. So.",
            "Yes, exactly. Well. That's that's not the point. Let's let's show it that it's doing something. Romanian is kind of critical because the project officer is Romanian.",
            "Oh. Ok, maybe I can I can add some.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, good to know.",
            "Around April 23. Yeah, so so PERSON4 should warn if deployment by April 18 or whatever would be at risk. Yeah, ok. So I think that's that's it, right? So I would like to thank everybody for the work. I'm I'm really to see that you have not been put off by the complications and let's keep the the strong the strength that that we have. So this is one of the few like social entertainments, I believe. So let's let's tick them. And let's so, let's now will be in close touch for the right up.",
            "I think of.",

So there is one thing to start with. And that's the availability of ORGANIZATION4 for the upcoming PROJECT1 call that's not related for what what the technical things that we want to discuss today at all. But I would like to remind PERSON6 of this Doodle. So, PERSON6 if you could fill this Doodle poll, it's only selecting the day for now. But we need to announce the day two weeks had so that we are we are according to the constitution agreement. So that's why we need to choose the day now.",

And my only concern is but I will not be in the office from 23rd to 2nd of May. To April 23rd to May the second. So I only have the next week, not next week the the following one.",

Call. I'm already taking a note in to my callendars. So hopefully this will work out. Thank you. So. Another thing is that if you have any photos from the trade fair. That will be great. I sent you an email. Some days ago. And sh. In that email I'll send you -. Sorry. I just want to disable some stupid thing, how do I disable this? Uh-huh, hard crowed disk indeed never when I click -. Where is remove?",

And we are also putting together a little video on that session. And we have your recordings and colleague of mine is looking at those, And I've like put them in some order into a little screenplay for this. So you are in, unless the technical quality proves to be too bad. But but it seems that it it should work out, At least from what I have seen. So when we have the video. We will show you, Will let you know, And also any pictures that you have maybe better than those that we have already, because like none of us was obviously concentrated on taking pictures so that's fine.",

            "That's could be useful as well and empty b, Because we we actually. I don't think we have a good picture of the booth. We have one in the video, So that, It even depending on what what exactly is in the booth. I think that that could be useful.",
            "Yeah. We'll send it to you right now.",
            "Okay, yeah. Thank you. So. Now the next thing on the agenda is this wiring detailed plan. And I'm not sure if you are seeing this at the moment. So I might be sharing. It is too small. But do you see any any drawing?",
            "Yes, but I had opened the linker and I took at.",
            "Okay, You can look at the drawing directly. So maybe the problem is also the fact that I'm sharing only one crontab, And not sh. And not the whole window or something like that. So, can you please confirm than the drawing is is more less correct. So we need to have specific. But when you have very detailed description for both the workshop, Which happens in June. And also for the ORGANIZATION8 Congress. And this drawing is for the ORGANIZATION8 Congress. Which is in a year from now. But still it needs to be put into the tender for like call for tenders. And it will take months or half years to to have this call for tenders like properly run and and decided. So that's why we need to describe the setting already now. So this is for the, for the ORGANIZATION8 Congress, Where we are supposed to be a translating and transcribing the main session. And also some workshops, And for the main session there will be this. Well do we know what we will be subtitling the main project, The main presentation, Or what is known about the the set up of the -. This is a question to to ORGANIZATION6. What is known about the set up of of the main presentation, And the plenary conferences.",
            "I think it's it is plan. I'm not sure if you do review allowed to concern subtitles in there. But I hope we will.",
            "Yes. So so we should we should plan for the option that we are actually allowed to intercept the main projecting screen and add subtitles to that. Which would be obviously only the language of the speaker. So limited number of languages. But at the same time, We expect that everybody in the audience will have their cell phones or whatever devices.",
            "We will be renting tablets for everyone. We will be there will be know connection in there.",
            "Yeah, So there will be many wireless user devices at the congress. And everybody should be able to connect to a specific website to see the live subtitles in whatever languages they choose. So, I don't know the the second person from ORGANIZATION6 is also involved in the exact like set up of that.",
            "Not really. But our only person familiar with audio.",
            "Okay. Yeah, yeah. So so in in essence the set up should be similar to what we had of the fair. But this needs to be described precisely for for the call for tenders, Because some outside company will provide old hardware that we ask for.",
            "Yes, the problem is audio mix and sounds of for all of this stuff.",
            "I didn't quite understand. The sound mixer they will have some sound mixer but we need to say what it should be capable of.",
            "So -",
            "Exactly.",
            "I mean to finalise this drawing with the details of the audio mixer and video mixer. How many and how they have to be connected the one each other.",
            "Yeah. So this is something that we have to describe ourselves, Because the company is not known. And this, We need to provide description complete description from our side, And whatever the company will be chosen afterwards, They will accomodate to this, That's my understanding. So what should we add drawing to have all the important details about the mixing. My level of description was was pretty like high-level. I only said that we expect that there would be some English sound that we could get hold off through an excel hour cable that's the lower part of the drawing, Or RCA cable or TS / TRS the small or larger jack once one per language. This is my this is my expectations. Do we need to provide any more details? For the call for tenders?",
            "We need to specify the audio mixer that needs need to be available. And how what kind of output way have to provide to the input of the booth. So for example, you know, as we have seen. We need the let me say the and copy of the output of the microphone. It is for the amplifier.",
            "Oh, so. So what what we used in practice was the what we used in practise was the phone like the the headphones output from the mixer.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And and PERSON2 was told this will not be available. So what you suggest is that you have that is that we get the direct copy from the microphone. But then that's difficult thing, Because as you see in my drawing either we need to get the microphone from the English speaker, Which is the main microphone somewhere in in the front, Or we need the microphones from the interpreters booths producing English.",
            "And well, I hope there will be some auxiliary output from the audio mixer builded not be sufficient?",
            "You have to be the it has to be the audio from the microphone before any mixing or any amplifier. So before the amplifiers. So it has to be the most clean audio as possible.",
            "Well, given that the audio mixer will be digital, If we can get any digital output that sounds okay for me.",
            "Okay. Okay, I think so, can you -.",
            "That its be written down to the drawing.",
            "Yes, now, we will need to know which digital audio output you can handle.",
            "Okay. We will have. Yeah. We have to check which kind of digital audio, okay. If you can add this info into the drawing going that.",
            "So where. So, where should we put this? Maybe.",
            "I think near to main audio mixer.",
            "Yeah. It has to be the microphones will be connected to the mean audio mixer. And then from the audio mixer there would be the need to have the digital output to the booth. For both listening and ASR.",
            "Yeah. Booth znamená nějakou vaši krabici, že?",
            "So PERSON6 when you say booth you mean the booth of the interpreters.",
            "Yes, yes, interpreters booth, sorry.",
            "Bus je myšleno jako sběrnice.",
            "Bus je sběrnice, no. Ale co bude digitálního? Sorry for switching in Czech. What is plans to be digital? If I've never work with digital microphones. So I would aspect that digital microphone is something which connects to USB as opposed to, the audio input of of the computer. But that's the only thing that I can imagine, But there is probably better hardware. So, what what what does digital microphone connect to work provide.",
            "But that's sometimes funny because the wireless connection is digital but then it's plain for the again, yes.",
            "Again, yes.",
            "That sometimes happens.",
            "Yes, what s.",
            "But when the mixer is digital than it should digital once again. But then to stay digital, I believe. But.",
            "So, how do we how do we get that? How do we ensure that this is. So I'm sharing exchange to show the whole screen so that you can see they the drawing. So I'm, I'm not really sure, where should I where should I add this into the drawing, because it is something which like applies to all the,, all the different languages.",
            "Yeah. It it is something between the speaker and the interpreters booth.",
            "Yeah, So PERSON6 you are in your thinking, Are you planning to capture the output of the interpreters as well, Or not? Because what I had in mind and what what is illustrating in this picture is that whoever speaks English, we will get that English sound in and from one input. So this, this requires someone clever to like decide whether we are getting the main the main microphone. Or the output of the interpreter's booth. And maybe this set up is not a good idea. Maybe you are thinking differently, Maybe you are thinking that we are only taking the main microphone. And we are totally ignoring interpreters booth or something else. So what it -.",
            "Still have to think about that. But I think getting the interpreter schools audio could be really useful in any case.",
            "Yes, yes, I think so. So in in short. So let's what should I what should I how should I record this. So. We need as original sound from the microphones as possible. I believe the digital sound or these two signal captured at the microphone. We need. I'm writing to the google document, I hope that you you can see that. We need this from booth main microphone of the plenary session. As well as for each of the languages from interpreters' booths that we can process which is English, German then we we promiss that in PROJECT1 to have also French and Czech. I should write Czech before German, Czech, French, We promise some Italian. So I was curious in the question if you will be doing that or Italian and Spanish we also promised some Russian, right? 2, 4, 6, 7. So this should be. This should be all the languages that we ideally, Would be able to process, right?",
            "I think there will be ones extra. I think it.",
            "Italian is extra. So -",
            "To language I think?",
            "Yes, so so what was the.",
            "There should be five plus Czech.",
            "Five plus Czech. Okay. So Italian is to that's and it's there -. Will there be Italian interpreters or not at all?",
            "I think so.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "Are you remember ORGANIZATION8 type set.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think Italian is simple project ORGANIZATION4 only.",
            "Okay. Yeah, so Italian is only like for your interests. So to say. So how should we describe this? And and also one more thing is the diarization. So we know that if we if we ask the company to give us the main stage microphone, Then we need to figure out what language is spoken there at the moment. If we ask the company as as I have drawn here to provide us with the English sound. It would be their responsibility to like mix it for us. But then they are like touch touching the signal, And we are not getting the very raw signal. So I don't know what is better?",
            "Can you can you please repeat because it wasn't as clear to me, What what do you mean?",
            "Yeah. So I'm I'm thinking what should be the exact wording of the description of what we need. If I use the wording being that is in the ORGANIZATION7 document now, Which says we need this which is the the microphone signal from both the main microphone as well as of from the interpreters booths. That would be one per language. That means that if the speaker speaks English, We will have as like we will have to run English ASR on the main microphone. And if the speakers speaks German, We would have to run a German ASR on the main microphone. So we would need to know what language is being spoken at the main stage. If we.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If we ignore the main stage microphone all together. And if we follow our drawing which says give us the English sound, Give us the Czech sound, give us the German sound, Then we do not need to do the diarization. Or the different languages, Because the company will do it for us. But then we are reliant on we relying on them not not distorting the signal. So like they will do something with the signal to select from the main microphone or from the interpreters booth. And there is risk that they will some home miss handle it.",
            "Yeah and and this is also something that is men while. So it also.",
            "At the conference normally. Because, I'm I'm really afraid that some interpreters may even work in more languages. And they decide on the spot which booth which cabine will emit which which language.",
            "Yes, that's what's expected that actually.",
            "Yeah. So how does it work for the final like end users who follow normal interpreters booth. I think they have like a selector of channels?",
            "Yes, they use own wireless transmitters and they own receiver with channels.",
            "Yeah, and the channels are like set for languages, so.",
            "I think so.",
            "So you like you when when you are getting this device as a participant at the conference, You know that if you want to listen to Spanish, You'll select channel five. And if the if the main speaker speaks Spanish, what happens?",
            "I think that's undefined.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, I don't know.",
            "Put the phones and to listen to -.",
            "Directly. Yeah. So I think maybe if we ask for the set up that, I have drawn. And additionally also the set up from the main microphone. Then we could be able to diagnose what language is being spoken from the FAG that the English sound from the interpreter is is silent. I don't know. PERSON6?",
            "I don't know either.",
            "The problem is that we will the company. The company will be contacted in two months from now. The first companies will be contacted. And then all of them will describe in detail how they will do it. They were describing solution, How much ORGANIZATION6 should pay for that solution, And then ORGANIZATION6 will have some criteria. And these criteria. We can hope elect. We can say what should be in the criteria. But that's it. It will run like offline deterministicly without our intervention. And some company will be decided. And only then once this this happens, Which will be in half year from now the soonest. Only then we can talk directly to the company. So the question is, what should be right? So the the best possible company is is chosen.",
            "It was also suggested that perhaps we could ask the company to rout the translated streams that to do main mixure and we would get it there. But I don't know about will be interfaces if they capture all the channels or if they output just the one that's going out. That something if you know that without because I think at least in the case of the more expensive option Dante I think there you get all the channels that go to the mixer in respect if of when they are selected or not.",
            "Or that what I would assume.",
            "Yes. So that's. Are you going that's a question for ORGANIZATION6, Are Dante is too expensive, or are you.",
            "Well, it is more expensive. So the others, which has Britain in the agenda now would be preferable.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, there is the IS fifty ultra net ISE view and Dante. So, PERSON6, do you have any experience with any of these digital interfaces?",
            "Not, just the Dante one.",
            "Yeah. So if it was Dante,. Just just so that I understead technical things. If it was dante, then everywhere is internet wiring. And that various devices probably have some whatever fingerprints or that somehow know what what should be directed somewhere and it's all software. And then we can simply connect to this Dante bas. And then we need something which would grab the the appropriate packets that are relevant like for for that like - What I have in the picture labelled as PROJECT1 notebook for English intput or PROJECT1 notebook for Czech input. How many. So with the a. You said that you've work with Dante so you need the Dante sound card or how does it work? Or is there a software sound card? You principally could just software sound card? PERSON6, have you ever recorded the Dante sound to a notebook? Have you ever sent it to the ORGANIZATION4 platform?",
            "But notebook we have a part of ours working with Dante. And as far as I remember, It's supposed to be a software decoding. But I have to double check with the with the this part.",
            "Okay, so so you don't have - You haven't done it yourself. But you have a,, like a company that that has used the ORGANIZATION4 platform, and they have shipped signal from Dante to platform.",
            "Yes. Exactly.",
            "Yeah, So the problem is that we need this description by Friday at the latest, right?",
            "And it would still work I think.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "It was last Friday but -",
            "It was actually the the last Friday. But -",
            "The next Friday it should be still possible to sneak an some technical details.",
            "So how she - By the way the internet should also be ethernet like but without IP. So it won't go to switches and all this stuff,",
            "But it's still should be possible I think to get a normal at work that.",
            "I can't hear you. As far as I know Dante has its own software. Available for both Windows and Mac too get audio from Dante network.",
            "Um-hum. So. What one needs to do only is to connect the notebook with Mac or Windows to this same ethernet. And then it will suddenly like the software can record the audio from some of the channels that that run over the network, right?",
            "Yep.",
            "Well, so that's a good question, Because even if the mixer has dante everything else will be done as if it hadn't I think. So it should be also explicitly said that the mixer will put the required channels on the bas. I'm I'm not sure how do mixers work, Perhaps they do always do it. But I'm not sure?",
            "Yeah. So,, I think we have to leave that so - Can we demand Dante? Would it make our lives easier? Or or not really like? I'm not sure? It definitely makes life little harder for ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Yes. So we would we would be - Aaa. Willing to provided if you say you can really work with it and you will. If you don't do be quite angry.",
            "Yeah. So the other options. They are like it's assume that it's well, Something which is limited to two channels is definitely not not an option.",
            "Unless there's one for each -",
            "Yeah. I think that -",
            "We don't have experience on the our options. Near us neither our partners.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's why we would like to move on Dante because we have this part of with experience some Dante and use these with our software.",
            "Yeah, and was the scale comparable to what what is the planned that the ORGANIZATION8. So was it in the the case that around six languages that we that you were recording or the the partner was was recording six input channels. Or well six languages. And maybe the 7th for the for the main microphone. Was was it that large scale, Or was it smaller?",
            "I have to check with my partner, Because you know it's it's not something he could maybe he can not disclose this information now.",
            "Yes, yes. Yeah. Well, what we simply need an estimated whether Dante is capable of of this. I don't know. I would expect it is possible. But it is the same network that will we will use for also the communication like after for for the communication to the to the mediator. I believe. So -",
            "That's sure.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it's definitely best to keep the audio support. And not use the network for the other.",
            "Okay, But then if we have this audio network even if it's Dante. Then you need the second internet card for each of the devices. So it's this is this is a complicated hardware set up. So in my set up which was analog sound, It assumed that we have one notebook per language, And we can definitely find enough notebooks for this. And each of the notebooks needs to be connected to the internet and get the. Get the sound and send it to the ORGANIZATION4 mediator. But with the dante set up I'm not sure how many notebooks would we need. Like one per language or or not? That's that's difficult question, And we are not sure whether it h. It has to be different internet wiring for the sound for the Dante and for the network. I would assume as PERSON2 says, It's it's better to give them separate. So it would need one notebook per language. And two internet cards like two internet plugs per notebook.",
            "If it should be fine with one notebook if it has sufficient power which should not be that high.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That's. Just audio. It's just audio but six channels at the same time.",
            "It's still just audio.",
            "Yes, so PERSON6. What, what do you what do you think? It's. What is more risky?",
            "Now, I I I know it's aaa only audio but I I think it would be better to keep data audio data and network traffic separated just because it is important not to have consestion on the audio network. So keep keep it them distinguished can guarantee no network consestion due to internet traffic. I would say.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So we. So that could make it quite expensive, Because we need the ethernet cards. Or quite risky, Because we wouldn't use the same network for the audio and the notebooks.",
            "So all you can bring a notebook computer for the task.",
            "We don't have that many desktops. There would be available.",
            "In the server?",
            "Yeah. Well, is a blade servers. Correct.",
            "One I think, But I to collect all the audio we will need one PC for each language.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I I think so. Just to be like on the safe side, Because if something fails, You can debug the than fixing to language by language as well,",
            "One technical.",
            "No no, Only one languages being spoken at the moment. So so the the few technicians can focus on the on the more important machine at the moment. So yes. So my drawing is is correct in the part PROJECT1 notebook for language. But it's wrong in the lowest part the the speakers. So we don't want. This is so the so - Here, I think that I should redraw it. And I should simply say that we want the sound from the speaker to one more notebook. PERSON6.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So so I'll I'll redraw the drawing so that we've one more notebook for the like main stage input. And then we will somehow either manually or automatically based on the activity or inactivity on the various outputs from the booths. We will have to decide what language is the current main channel in. And then like is is it difficult in in the ORGANIZATION4 platform to relabel client that. So how do you. Yeah that's it. So how do many of these notebooks connects to the same mediator? So far we have always run one client and not a same clients?",
            "Where can be multiple clients connecting to the same mediator. This is not an issue at all.",
            "But all of them are providing something which needs to be like operated on jointly. So it's not separate sessions. It's not one notebook per per lang. Like all of them are providing inputs to the set up. And then the translation is is run, Not like we're not running all of the many the translation engines. We want to run multilingual translation engines. So any of the separate notebooks after the ASR can provide input to the multilingual translation system. So that's that's the hard part. I know that the.",
            "But it's not something that's done at the laptop, Because, you know, when you ask for -.",
            "Session?",
            "For a session this is done by the mediator involving the the the workers. So if we have six laptops these corresponds to six sessions into the in the a mediator. Each one targeting one source language.",
            "Yeah. So that the set up than for us would be like from, that that's hard. How do how would how do we provide the the 23 output languages? Because we need to join these sessions in the mediator. In then based on the available empty systems, Decide which of them are the best ones to use. So there could be direct fair in some cases, Or there could be pivoting via English. And if you are doing pivoting. Let's let's say that we are doing pivoting via English. So if the input is in English. Then and and let's say that the final step is multilingual system that goes from English into all the languages. So then you need to select the session coming from the main in main input notebook if the main speaker speaks English. But then you need to switch to the English sound, If he speaks Russian. So we. We take the extra delay of the interpreter, And then use use the English sound. And if our German ASR is good. And the main speaker speaks German, We needs then again switched to the the the main microphone and use German ASR on it. And then this German needs to be translated to English. And then this English needs to be translated to all the target languages. So there is a fair bit of logic. And both the sound switching. And also at the translations switching. And this is something that needs to be like flexible during the day. So we don't want to stop the notebook, stop the clients running at all the all the notebooks to to to have them connect to a new session or. So I don't know how to set this up at the moment.",
            "Yeah. But but but I think that that basically what we are saying, Is that that was the need of a director. Human director. But selects what's needs to be. The director switch to the English interpreter, for example. So every language, every input language has have to have its own session with the mediator. With all of the workers in the mediator. If it is one single multi language ASR or if it is based on multiple machine translation workers. And then need to have director selecting which output needs to be published. We needs to be streamed to the customer.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So I agree that every input notebook has to like come up with its own session. But then the this is the part that we are not familiar with, Because so far we have only seen the ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1 lecture translator view. And that ORGANIZATION1 lecture translator somehow magically knew that there is a new session available. And in that session it's new which languages are available. So I my understanding would be that this director the person would see the outputs from all the ASRs. So all the in in input notebooks would start a client session that provides like ASR in that language, Then the director would monitor the outputs of the ASR and they the director would like say which of this sessions should be directly transferred to another session, And there would be the multilingual translation. So the director would would like and the clients will have their own view. And these these views would be again wuu multilingual or single language. That's that's thing, But they would be constantly connected. And the director would like redirect different sessions to them. Would that be possible? So we need like - What what is the presentation platforms? That's this is something that you are expected to develop. And maybe you have something halfly there. But this is something which is critical. We need to have the clients the end user devices connected to the same session ID, different sessions obviously, but like clients session. And we need to switch various translations to them based on what what is available?",
            "Yeah. We don't have yet the solution to this. But I we are we taking on going that we bad. Regarding the director the human director to select which output to be published for each session for for each sorry for each speech.",
            "Yeah. And and this this will be implemented by PERSON4 or over or supervise by PERSON4 or someone else or you?",
            "Thus.",
            "Okay, PERSON4.",
            "Yeah, PERSON6 or PERSON4.",
            "Yeah it is it is us but I we have to come back with proposal to be shared between us.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. So this is this is something very important. And we the time is short for this. Because it's already it's in two months actually. Like two and 20 days extra I know. So it's in in 80 days we need is running in reliable. So. But but anyway back back to the set up. So we will definitely need one PC per input channel and we can leave it open whether this channel what the input with what the sound will be - Yeah, Well, okay, so. For the if will be easier for for the workshop in those 80 days. But stil, this is where we need to test the the switching lives so that it works for the ORGANIZATION8 congress which is in a year from now, We will demand that we get as direct a sound from each of the interpreters booths labeled by the language. So we know what from the interpreters booths with demand that is only English coming from these booths. Not that someone suddenly start speaking German at that booth. That could happen like due to the flexibility.",
            "I think that you are now for assumed the interpreters to run of from the booth and just places.",
            "Yes. Yes, but who does this mixing of the channels normally?",
            "I think there's a separate interpreting kind of device. That's like an audiomixer.",
            "It's like a booth mixer.",
            "I think there's another person behind another device that that does it.",
            "And we do not want the output from this like interpreters mixing device because that will be like one more level of volume changes. And so on, right?",
            "Also, maybe there I must even sure how many me microphones are in the booth?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Is that just one or one per person?",
            "I have no idea. So that's then that's it. So we will simply demand that we want the direct output from the main microphone and direct output from each language of the interpreters booths. And for the main microphone we are happy to like accomodate to the language. But for the interpreters booths we are we demanded that they are labeled, right? PERSON6, does that sound okay?",
            "Can you please repeat, sorry?",
            "Yeah? So. I'm trying to word what do we demand from the sound mixing company.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I think that we demand that there is one mic one direct microphone output from the main microphone. And -.",
            "Yes.",
            "And that there is one direct microphone output from each of the booths and for these the booth microphones we demand that only the predefined languages is spoken at that channel. So if someone says this is the English microphone. Then it must be English coming from that.",
            "Yes.",
            "Does that does that sound acceptable to us?",
            "Yes, I think so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If we this realistic? Já si říkám královna koloběžka v týdle chvíli, protože smixovaný i nesmixovaný.",
            "Co jak smixovaný i nesmixovaný?",
            "No chceš mít vybraný, který tam je kanál.",
            "No.",
            "Ale zároveň nechceš, aby někdo vybíral.",
            "Jo.",
            "Just as it might be impossible to request that from the company.",
            "Yeah. So the the the PERSON2 correctly says that -. Well no not really. I say that in each booth only one language should be spoken. So if the interpreters speak other languages, yes they will have to shuffle booths. And that we want direct microphone output from that. I think that's -. I think it makes sense from our point of view. It's difficult for the interpreters, but it's doable. It's not.",
            "Depends what will -.",
            "What the company has -.",
            "How what the interpreters will want to be paid for a such a physicall jak se říká. Also they will probably have to be a bit more room round the booths, So they can get around quickly because they there otherwice the booth will be born together. Because there's little.",
            "But how does it work normally? I. Who knows, who knows what languages they speak in what languages they this like, how do they communicate with the with the director of the interpreters?",
            "I just googled an image of interpreters booth.",
            "Yeh. This is like the -",
            "Also there is discussion that where they will be placed. If they will be placed in a balcony, Then they will use the windows going on. Because they need to. Otherwise they will get monitors.",
            "Okay.",
            "And yes on the balcony they don't want them running around on the actor for balcony. Back to the topic. In this case is not just a waste because it will be just for a one channel that not useful.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you want one of the other interfaces from the main mixer under main microphone. Then why not, but.",
            "So there is still another problem laws. So I'm, I'm quite confident that there will be more microphones at the main stage than just one. So how do we ask for one microphone output. That's the. Yeah. PERSON6, how how bad is it to use some auxiliary output from the mixing device? It it can be it -",
            "How bad is? How bad is?",
            "Yeah. How bad it is. Yes.",
            "Sorry, how bad is it to?",
            "To use the auxiliary output from the mixing device instead of the direct microphone output.",
            "Ooo, depends of the vi sound mixer. I mean.",
            "Out the mixer, that's it yeah.",
            "Maybe we can have second microphone just for PROJECT1 for translation. Completly independence set of microphone.",
            "So you voluntier to run round the poud you to whoever just speaks?",
            "We need to hire someone for this. But. When you watch TV and there is some press conference that -.",
            "There is often many microphones.",
            "Yes. Many microphones in in front of one speakers. So, they must be used with.",
            "But then you don't want the direct conection to each of those.",
            "Anyway. Let's okay.",
            "Of the digital output from the main mixer, I think.",
            "Yeah, that -.",
            "It should be fine.",
            "Yeah. So the digital output from the main mixer.",
            "Then you have the it's switch to the correct microphone.",
            "Then we can easily switch to the correct microphone.",
            "Or you will have its switch for you.",
            "So it seems like we will prefer Dante because it's -",
            "One of the others.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If it's just one channel or channels, because -",
            "No per language. Per language.",
            "Well there's no languages on the stage. There is just what spoken. If we are well the main mixer, Then is there is just one channel. So even if you chose the ASETU then it's still one channel and you are fine.",
            "Mm-hmm. So can we can the call for tenders contain options?",
            "Well, yes, But then be attending not us.",
            "Yes. And we choose, and you choose the the company based on what options they have chosen.",
            "But if we have if we don't put the requirement for Dante there, then probably no one will offer because it's more expensive.",
            "More expensive, yes.",
            "It's lot more expensive. Not in absolute numbers but in relative it's a bit.",
            "But if they - You should be fine with - Dante is good if you transport to manage up.",
            "Yes, yes. But I think one. But I think that Dante would be also solution for them. For the booths.",
            "If you want all the signal back to the main mixer and you use it to capture those, But then you will also need some switch and those notebooks, Even that you want one notebook per channel anyway.",
            "I don't see.",
            "The point. Yeah.",
            "The advantages is not as big to concentrate all the in to one cable. If you wanted to have just one machine that connects to the booths, That makes more sense.",
            "Yeah. Okay, So well. We'll specified as set. We will demand one channel direct microphone output. Preferably digital from any number of microphones from the main stage. And also one direct microphone output from each of the translation booth for English, Czech, German, And then what what about the other languages? Do we mention them, Or do we not plan the -. So for the given the promises in the project proposal. We do not have to cover the ORGANIZATION8 congress which our French ASR or with our Russian ASR. It would be a nice thing to have. But it's not obligatory. So the question is whether we will demanded here or or not. And I think that we should say yes, We should say that we want these. So I have removed Italian, right?",
            "And -.",
            "For for these for June in in.",
            "For June English only English will be spoken. So June is good, Because it's very similar to the set up that we had that at the fair, But we for June we need to have the multiple targets target languages. So we need to present the the participants with the slides, And with the subtitles of their choice on in a web based interface on a wired connection. But it needs to be translated into many languages from one English ASR. So the the set up is essentially very similar. We just need the different presentation platform for June. And for for the year from now, we need yeah we will I think - Yeah. I think we were done with this with this set up up wave. Essentially, we have come to the conclusion that we could have had upfront. But that's it's important to go through this. So I'll I'll changed as I described, or to change the drawing. And we will say that for each of the recording notebooks per language it's actually up to the company whether they provide us with digital input or or single channel correct.",
            "That's risky. Because, if you don't specify digital output you can get any of those or some others.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think it would be preferable to say get booth analog output as a call back and one -.",
            "Yes.",
            "Digital interface scholar choice.",
            "Okay. Yes.",
            "So what would be available?",
            "Yes. Yes, yes. So can you can you phrases to the ORGANIZATION7 document.",
            "If we can get PERSON6 to say.",
            "So PERSON6.",
            "Support one of those cheaper digital interfaces. Because if we want analog as a full back then really if we don't want to pay for Dante if it's just for the case.",
            "Call back and one cheaper non Dante digital output. So PERSON6? It seem that Dante does not simplify the things. Because we still want one notebook per language. So it seems that ORGANIZATION6 is is not willing to to provide Dante. And then in that case we can always fallback to the to the to the analog audio. But would you. Would you make a decision -",
            "With my partner.",
            "Yeah, so please, let us know, And like by mid week or on Friday at the latest. What digital audio should be specify in the in the documentation. So we will ask for the six language language labeled wires and one main stage wire. And it has to be analog fallback and digital of preferably the one thing that you choose. Right? Yeah. Okay so I hope that someone has taken notes for me.",
            "PERSON6? Let us know on now by Thursday. So we have Friday to process process proceseed with a ORGANIZATION6, okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah, And part of that is so let's - We have discussed sorry for this very long discussion. But like well, We are just not experienced enough to to make the the guess what will work best. So we need to discuss it with detail. So then for the microphones. This is also something that can be and should be demanded in the call for tenders. So if you have any numbers that you can put into the call for tenders like sensitivity and frequency response and noise, Please include those numbers. So this defines all the individual microphones that the speakers will use.",
            "I think to for us it's important to specify the microphones on the stage.",
            "Yes.",
            "But there will be also I think one microphone per to people in the audios.",
            "But I think we do not really care about those.",
            "Yes, no. We don't expect to to to to translate a questions. So they those will can be you cheaper.",
            "Yeah. So. So PERSON6, can you can you copy from some of your other materials the specification of the microphones that are needed?",
            "So we by the way people wants these on the stage.",
            "Wired or wireless?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Wired or wireless?",
            "To the use different sets of parametres?",
            "No but for example wired microphones are usually better because they can use better card in the receiver and the you the microphone is bigger usually when the wireless one now. But I but I in fact the main differences is the main difference is if it test to be some sort of wireable ust like or something that all all if it can be the classic microphone.",
            "I would expect wireless for the stage. And if you want to specify in the booths and actually it's possible to change those.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then those could be large.",
            "No it should be wired. I'm sure, but also for the main stage. I would actually expect it will be wired microphone at the black booth at the stand of the speaker. Fixed as as as is common in in like conference hall or.",
            "I think this is not not for us to decide anyway.",
            "I would say that we prefer wired microphones involving the main one. So this specification should be for for wired primarily. And then like maybe add a note like if you have to go wireless followed these numbers. So yeah. So PERSON6 please provides this specification for and that's will be main stage wired microphones and interpreters booths large microphones. In the unfortunate case of wireless is also specify the characteristics of those. So PERSON6 is that is that clear?",
            "Let me check. Yes. Yes.",
            "So we need to specification for the wire microphones. At both types of locations. And we also need the specification for the wireless main stage. In case the company, or someone else besides it has to be wireless. But we don't prefer wireless. So. Yeah. So again this is this is something that we need to know by Thursday. Then you mention that. Okay, so. Let's let's move quickly to the. Yeah I I was supposed to be living at the moment already. But yes. So please, please the next item is to get a contact for someone from ORGANIZATION4 who will handle the presentation platform. And the idea here. So this is the so this is for you or for PERSON4. But the idea is that the platform will have to be different for the workshop in June, And for the ORGANIZATION8 congress. Because the setting is different. So actually for the congress we will need two types of presentation platforms. And one of those platforms for the ORGANIZATION8 congress will be the same as the one in June but there also be the the the wireless devices only for the for the next year. So if we focus on the upcoming the June workshop. What we need to do what we need to have is something like that keeps the lecture translator thing except that I would really like to mix it with the with the screen from the main presentation. So my idea is that we will do video grabbing from the main presentation computer, As it is sending the the screen to the main projector. So we'll put put a video mixer there the the epiphan device and and steel signal, And then we will stream video of the slides, As a live streaming channel to the wired network. And then we need web web based presentation where people will see this this stream slides. And also they will have the choice to to choose which subtitles they want to see. And this part is essentially the ORGANIZATION1 media presenter the one that you have seen, and that you work with.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some sort of lecture just later or something like that.",
            "Yeah. So. Will it be you or PERSON4 or still someone else who will be actually coding this thing.",
            "Please PERSON4 will be the focal point.",
            "Yeah. So the thing is that it has to have this capacity that the ORGANIZATION1 lectured translator has. So it has to connect to the mediator and observe whatever channels that whatever channels it whatever language is there are and so on, But it also should include in the html the video streaming you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we need to like someone either you or we need to develop the video mixer. So the notebook that is used to steal the slides as presented. And it has two purposes the notebook it one for one thing it creates the English subtitles underneath. And for another thing it is streams the it sends out the video of of the grab slides to the network. So it serves as the web server that anybody can connect to engage the streaming from. Do you see the set up? Do you understand the the set up that I've just. Yeah. So this is this is something that we really need to develop in those 80 days. And yeah. We should synchronize on this very early. So please find the person the not just PERSON4 but they the one would be actually coding this, or if it is PERSON4 then fine. But we need to talk with this person as soon as possible so that the specification is clear to the person, And that we can test it early and so on.",
            "Yes, it's important to have video steamer, Which suppose, for example, age less. The ORGANIZATION3 is is streaming.",
            "Ahaa, okay. Yeah. I don't know that. So, yeah. So that means like if the notebooks are then ORGANIZATION3 notebooks, It won't be ORGANIZATION3 notebooks. It will be some some windows-based machines. I'm sure.",
            "The the ORGANIZATION3 the protocol ORGANIZATION3 live streaming is a just the protocol, but it's - It's supported all both Windows and Linux and whatever we use - Could be also the engines streaming engine, and in this.",
            "Okay. Well, I have no experience with this. So. So if you can,, connect me with the person who knows or if well yeah. Yeah. So the question is, Who will be developing the video grabber part. And who will be developing the presentation part. You will be doing surely the presentation part,. And the the video grabbing part is something that needs to do both this streaming. And at the same time it is needs to presented and add the English subtitles.",
            "Yeah, we have to double check for the presentation of the English subtitle. We have to talk about that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Not just English.",
            "Well, no for the main screen it will be only English.",
            "Right. Right.",
            "So the idea is that on the main screen will be presenting will be only video mixing English subtitles under the slides.",
            "We have to talk about that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because the it is a little bit. We have to understand if it's visible to also mix the subtitles at the same time. We have to talk about these.",
            "Yeah. Why would there be a problem? I I see it only as a way as a different client. So they. Well. I know the nice. Yeah.",
            "It's aa just a little bit more difficult, Because the was the need to have one dedicated video screen to prepared the subtitles to be published on the media platform. These quite for sure would need a deal mixer for on the ORGANIZATION6 and when does the need to have the set up also off the subtitles have to be put on screen be not to for example going to areas or black areas. Depending on the color the subtitles. It's a just a little bit more it a more informations and more word to be done.",
            "Yeah. So I've I've started putting this together with simple like X Windows set up so that the idea is that I use Mplayer embedded Mplayers. So I like repair that's that's function from X window. So I I create in in set up where I specify the rectangle for for a slightly reduced slides and I use Mplayer to to just show the webcam that comes from the video grabber which is the slides live. And below that I can easily again and again shown whatever found I have in in my X Windows which is still like limited so far. And extern and. What I would need is a client or monitor of a mediator which emits plain text outputs to this extern. And that would that would be flexible enough for me. But that would not do the streaming of the slides at the same time, So that in order to, to do the stream of the slight, something would have to be added. And it's also not as nice as as you were, As you have for the Romanian set up where you have an overlay off the slides to the subtitles. So -.",
            "I ment mean to do. But it's. It's a little bit more complicated.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So we we need to find the decide who will do this. Yeah. So are you willing to do this at ORGANIZATION4, Or should we be involved in the implementation of this?",
            "I I would say that if you if you do that. It could be better, because you know, there is all of the our stuff to be completed and.",
            "So I'll keep looking at this myself. And if I'm struggling. Then I will let you know, soon enough, So that we can jointly find a fallback solution, But I still keep it in my. It is in my to do list.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So then the next question. Will, you also try to get your ASR in the whole lifetime of the project for Italian? So would you be planning to train your own engines? And who would get. That's the question, because like we have here we have PERSON7 we have met him and it would be very useful for PERSON7 to have a chance to talk to anyone like fighting with the same problems. The idea is to use PROJECT2 before the set up. So we need a connector for PROJECT2 to the mediator.",
            "We don't. We are not using PROJECT2. We are use on ASR -",
            "Still a different thing.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So you not even PERSON5 not even the the toolkit from ORGANIZATION1? Yes, something else.",
            "No, it's our own. It's based on ORGANIZATION5 speech recognition it's evolution of ORGANIZATION5 ASR. It's our own ASR and we already integrated the these in to the mediator and but -. That's why we can easily add Italian as lang as a supported language. If obvisously it needs all of the customization for the ORGANIZATION6 events.",
            "Yep. Yep. Okay. So. In that case, we can only like keep asking you with who for various tips like how to integrated best. But essentially you are not on the same boat. We are. We are behind. So we need to like coop ourselves.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. And then the the last question is related this. But yes, yes, yes. The last question is related to this because if we are on our ground before do if we are if we are developing this ourselves. It would be useful for us to have a look at the python connector, which you are still developing. So the question is when the python connector to the ORGANIZATION4 platform would be ready?",
            "Let me say that we are struggling with one let me say issue in the python binding python binding. But if you want add this mix the the integration still not working at point. So if you want I can in any case share the status of the binding to the mCloud, the python binding. And we can have a double check on the on the binding itself. If you have someone in python maybe it could be useful.",
            "Yeah. Yes, there is people who used python around. So I think it would be very useful to share even if it's not working at the moment, Because we were like already start start looking at how to connect to that. And maybe yes, maybe we will be able to to help with that issue as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "Publish it probably again to the public website, right? Would that be okay?",
            "Yes. Yes. Yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So that that will be great. So I'll then directly pass it to PERSON7. Well share the code so far to the public PROJECT1 web. Yeah. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON12 will started to PERSON7. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's everything. So thank you for this long and exhausting call. Sorry. Remember, we need the details on the PERSON3 from you. And we need to what was the other most important part the cho the choice of the digital input. So the choice of the digital. And the PERSON3 specifications. We will redraw the picture to make it clear that we want one more channel for the main stage. And we will we will be reliable ourse. Will be responsible ourselves for the choice like which ASR to run and what, But we don't - We will only struggle with the main stage, And not with the other booths. That would be responsibility of that company. And that's it. Right?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, Okay so. Thank you very much. I don't have any other questions myself, Anyone else? Any other comments, questions?",
            "You get just one channel, and that will be it, right?",
            "Yes, for June, we are getting only English channel. And we are expected to produce this videomixing thing and we will synchronize on this very soon.",
            "So the channels they can be spread over space, right? If you, if the main channel from the stage is available at the different physical locations.",
            "Ou.",
            "It could be fine.",
            "So yes, like, physically for the main ORGANIZATION8 congress. We need all these notebooks to be connected to the same hardware network which is indicated in the picture. The same ethernet. Over switch or router. And as long as this is through, Physically they can be anywhere. Yeah.",
            "It's.",
            "Yeah, so I think that the all the the set up here is is like correct except for the sound which we have discussed. Okay? So. Thank you very much PERSON6. Thank you. If you are still there.",
            "Yes. Sorry. PERSON6 has leave for a second yet the call but everything is clear, thank you. And here is PERSON4.",
            "You are here all time. So you know, you have heard everything. PERSON4, right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes. That's good. So we need to figure out like who will be implementing the the presenter and so on. So thank you. And yeah, have a good rest of the day.",
            "Bye. Bye, bye."

            "Is that a message for us?",
            "OK. Is it better now? OK, so - Yeah. What news we have? So first about the reviewers. PERSON7, have you contacted anyone?",
            "No I didn't cause we didn't really agree on who we want to contact. We were discussing like this, this linguist and we weren't sure if it's really for linguists. Like I think - The last or previous meeting, I don't know. That we thought, OK, so, we wanted to write it for linguists but we linguist won't understand it anyway. So I don't know if to send it to such people.",
            "Yeah. Ye so I don't know what, what, what knows about, knows about neural networks. But she's really only a linguist or she knows something at least a bit about, about transformer or I don't know.",
            "I, I asked PERSON6 and he, he agreed that he could, he could do the review, so -",
            "So I have one, one,, assistant professor from, from LOCATION2, you know.",
            "And he, he's doing,, similar thing as, as, as, as we do, so -",
            "He should, - And I exchange it with,, because I, I will, I will review,,, this dissertation is like,, for,, of, one of his student which is very, and this, this, this similar to our book so, so we only exchange it.",
            "We will read the similar things.",
            "Yeah, that's nice.",
            "Cool.",
            "I mean, I mean,, the introduction, so the introduction about the, about the deep learning and, and all the PROJECT3 and all the, all the notable models.",
            "ADSCL so it will be very similar. So we will only exchange it and,, yeah. So we have one.",
            "But PERSON9, PERSON9 want, wanted three so that he could decide,, he could choose two of them.",
            "So -",
            "So I suggest I can ask,, PERSON2 but I would kind of try to explain that, yeah,, maybe she won't understand it and, like, she shouldn't care or I don't know. We just need like one page review or something, so,, I don't know. Cause -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's like - Yeah, like it, it's it's not really like giving an easy introduction for somebody who never worked with neural networks.",
            "Yeah. So should -",
            "There is an introduction, which is good but I think it's good maybe for someone who worked with other machine learning algorithms or something.",
            "And what about the other, the other people there in a, in a document? So all, all these people are linguists? So -",
            "Yeah, basically.",
            "So it's, it's people - I would say they're similar to,, PERSON10. So they're, they're primarily linguists and they're trying to do some computational stuff but it's kind of difficult for them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So - But I don't know if, if we think that the book is for them or not.",

            "Yeah.",

            "OK, so - So I can try to ask,, PERSON2 and PERSON11.",
            "Yeah, you can try - Yeah, ask them. Send them, send them the current version of the book, of our book.",
            "OK.",

            "OK, so yeah. I, I will ask them,, and yeah. And it's, it's like one page review or, or what should it be?",
            "It was in the email. I think it was like one page review.",

            "Yeah, I, yeah. I forward it to you, by not,...",
            "Yeah. I have the, yeah, one or two pages is enough it says, so... OK. OK.",
            "One or two pages. Yeah, at least we c, we can have from, from PERSON2 or,, another linguist, we could have, we could have information what is, what is understandable for,, for these people, so yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "For us. So because PERSON6 he is mainly like, he's not a linguist, he is like in, engineer, more like engineer,, so he knows what about,, about all the deep learning techniques and he knows a bit less about linguistics so it will be -",
            "Very different, different point of view.",
            "Oh yeah. So yeah, so, so he should really be able to assess whether is true kind of and so on. Whereas for these linguistic reviewers,, it's like, yeah, they don't have to, I don't know check the maths or check, check,, that, that it's true what we write cause they're not experts but we're interested in whether it's interesting for them, whether they learn something, whether they understood something kind of.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK. OK.",
            "Yeah, and we, we could - Yeah. So - But we should have three reviewers for, for PERSON9 so maybe I could, I could ask someone from LOCATION1 but,, yeah, I don't know whether to ask PERSON3 or whether to ask some of his students. Maybe it will be better. Or some of,, post-doctoral researches there.",
            "I would be afraid that PERSON3 would be too harsh.",
            "Yeah. So maybe I will, I will ask like the, not PERSON3, but some people from -",
            "His group, but not PERSON3.",
            "PERSON3 reviewed my dissertation and what I understood is that,, when he knows that it's some kind of official review which is important for something so, then he's finally writing a nice review and then like unofficialy he told me the comments like what's wrong and, and what should be done differently and so on.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that, that's -",
            "The case a bit.",
            "So, so, so this is what he did for my dissertation. So... But yeah.",
            "OK, yeah. Another question from, from the, from the last meeting. If PERSON4 should be a co-author of our book. I think he, there's a substential part what was, which was written by him so I would, I would add him. As a co-author. If you are not against this. I - But I suppose -",
            "Sure.",
            "Yeah. OK. So let's add it there, add him there and,...",
            "So you just started and you're already author in the book. Good.",

            "Hundreds, n, no, 30 pages but they divide.",
            "Number of.",

            "Like lot of pages. To have think they don't pay attention.",
            "Yeah, they don't, they don't pay attention.",
            "It's OK.",
            "It's fun.",
            "Like 30 pages but already like with, with you and with, with PERSON1 so -",

            "So yeah, so, so it should be at least, if you.",

            "Physical or virtual?",
            "It's physical.",
            "It's physical? OK, cool.",
            "I already.",
            "Yeah, and I,, submitted,, one paper,, what I done with people from LOCATION1 to PROJECT2 and it was accepted as well. So it's, it's not surprise, but.",
            "So we have two - Yeah, great. So now we have two, two articles in journals,, on this, on this project so, so, yeah. So we have everything what we have, what he have promised but, but the book.",
            "By the way, how were the PROJECT5, PROJECT5, PROJECT5 reviews?",
            "Yeah, PERSON4, PERSON4's paper was very good. It was like 3.5, 3.54 I think.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Woah. That sounds great.",
            "I don't know it's - Yeah.",
            "Papers.",
            "I just found out that's one of the reviewers review wrong verison of the paper like -",
            "Aha? How is that possible?",
            "Because he refer to some things that were only on Archive, but not in our submitted version. So...",
            "That's interesting. It happened to me as well that somebody refers to. In my case it was he referred to some previous version which I submitted to some previous conference so, -",
            "But I found it out after the response.",
            "Just find it out some things that were really different -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Submitted version, but they didn't rewrite that's so.",
            "That's fun. Yeah. So basically for PERSON4 I would say they complain that maybe it's rather for a short paper than a long paper, but otherwise they liked it.",
            "Yeah, they complained about SUD but -",
            "Yeah, the SUD, yeah.",
            "And what about - What about your paper? About,... About multilinguality?",
            "The scores were two times 3.5 and, and once 3,, if you, if you follow the ORGANIZATION1,...",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I missed the for the but I emailed the chairs. By the way, you didn't tell me that,, that the email that I pasted it was like was for the 2019 chairs,, so - Anyway I emailed it 2019 chairs, they, they forward it to 2020 chairs - And they uploaded manually, - The responses, so, so it work out finally.",
            "Great. So this email includes something that you're stupid that don't understand the. And turned out that yeah, you don't understand emails as well but...",
            "Well, he just doesn't have the concept of time.",
            "That's a nice explanation. OK, good.",
            "OK, so yeah. Let's go back to the, to the book because,, so wh, what are your time plans for, for this, this week and the, the next week? I think that PERSON7 told, PERSON7 wrote that he's only, this is on, the only day he is working or what is?",

            "Yeah.",
            "Or - Yeah, I think six months or five moths, I don't know. But - Yeah.",
            "So you want to kind of at least have it submitted for printing this year?",
            "Yeah. No, no. Submitted for prin, printing not. Because we will - I don't know. But it must be, it must be printed, it must be ready like the, the, the books mi must be ready,, in, in June so I don't know... But the, the, the book should be, for the reviewers the book should be finished like at the end of September.",
            "OK.",
            "I don't want to prolong it anymore because it's - Yeah, it's, it's, it's getting even worse the writing and it's, it's -",
            "It's really bad and I would like to - Yeah.. finish it.",
            "Yeah, and splitting outdated.",
            "Yeah, it - Yeah, it's, yeah, it 's slightly outdated so yeah, we should, we should finish it somehow and, and - Yeah, the reviewers can, can get,, on, only version which is not finished, fully finished but it will be better if they,, if they, if they get almost finished version.",
            "OK.",
            "Text part so - So maybe it's - I don't know what it - What to discuss now but, maybe it's it's better to start writing and we can, we can -",
            "Yeah. Like my plan is to, to finish my chapter. And once I have my chapter finished then I'm happy to help with other chapters, but. But.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's like - I would prefer first finishing my, my stuff.",
            "PERSON7, I went throught the rest of your chapter and left 20 of comments.",
            "Like half of them are terminological distinction between,, what are features and what are abstractions.",
            "Great. Yeah, I know we talked about this and we found that yeah, I don't understand the terminology well, so, I expect that, yeah, there is a lot of mess in distance.",
            "On, but otherwise I think it's if you, if you read the comments. The only chapter that I didn't read except for the unwritten parts of, of, of PERSON8's chapter. Is,, is, is what PERSON1 wrote, but I'm not really sure where I star, where I should start or - Because, because there are some parts with my comments but they, they moved around.",
            "So shall I read it from, from the beginning till the end or?",
            "I, I think I answered your comments - May I have your attention, yeah. I think I answered your comments in, in the first part.",
            "OK.",
            "I think - Yeah. I think I. Yeah. It was - I answered your comments in the first sections but the last section which is, which is - Where it is? Section,... Only section but 5.3.",
            "OK.",
            "5.3 how, written but - So I think there are no - But I see last your comments is in on page 71.",
            "Yeah, but I think it, it appear just by moving some parts around. Because it's like totally isolated in the middle of, of the text that I think I didn't see.",
            "Yeah. I think I commented all of your comments. Or commented out because it was it was somehow solved and - And some for some comments I've reacted,... And that's all I think.",
            "Right. And ju, just being curious, what's the expected outcome of today's hackathon?",
            "To, to write something. Because the, I see that the last, the last weeks it was not, there was not, not much commits. Only, only PERSON8 commited something, some small changes but - It was everything so yeah. So the goal of this hackaton is to write something, some substantial amount of text and, and move - Somewhere. OK, so maybe it, it - Or if you don't have, do you have anything else? I would, I would start writing and, and see - We can discuss thing on Slack or we can, we can have another, another meeting at afternoon but... Yeah?",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, so... So see you and, and -",
            "Have a good day. Bye.",
            "Bye-bye."

            "Yeah. Yeah. I'm. I see people coming in. That's great. Yeah. I am totally failing to get down to the SLT IW SLT evaluation. The deadline is May the 20th?",
            "The 27th.",
            "27th, yeah, yeah, Okay. Yeah. It's getting worse and worse. Yep. Okay.",
            "I think this weekend. If we speak the weekend, we can put time on it, but don't worry about it. I I I'm just doing my stuff, and I'm not contributing in PROJECT4 now. And so it's not blocking things. But I think maybe this week Yeah. we should have a meeting and decide about it. And just. I am touch, I am in touch with PERSON2. And PERSON2 is preparing that, that Jupiter. So I think everything is there and everything is fine. I saw it and it's good. So now we need you know something to me and you decide together I think so.",
            "Yeah. I am happy to hear that it it's making a good progress. Yeah, Okay. Great. I see most of you are actually here, thanks. So let's, let's go quickly over the topics that you have listed. Today is the last Tuesday meeting before I have to somehow close the Surge points for this month. And so if you have not listed yourself yet, this is the last call. And I'll I'll somehow process it onwards. So just serious reminder. And then on Friday we're running the demo for the Project Officer and it is. Surprisingly complicated. Be, given how many tests we have already done. So I'm I'm really like. I was not anxious before the preparations for the demo started. And I'm getting more and more anxious as as they are running. And, I have 2 questions for PERSON6 because today he mentioned in another call that we had, that we lost some of the copies of the of the ORGANIZATION7 model. Is is s that true? Can you?",
            "That is definitely true.",
            "Yeah. So this is.",
            "I tried get it back from. So actually had some autom some scripts also which made work. Oh sorry. I also had some scripts which made the work easier. Those have also been deleted.",
            "Yeah. So this is a big big warning for everybody. Never, never keep only one copy of things. Always have things versioned and always have things like on multi, in multiple directories. So to say.",
            "Yeah. Probably you are right.",
            "So and and and if you remember many months ago. I have set up with directory in net data PROJECT4, which was called something like models. And that was supposed to be the copy off all the systems or maybe systems. Net net data PROJECT4 systems. And that was supposed to be like a static back-up copy of all the systems. So that if anything goes wrong, we would have a a source to to copy them over. So, so, how much work is is needed to get this to get this local copy up again.",
            "So actually I have the links from PERSON14 so I just need to download them. So that is not a. So that is like. Almost like 50 percent work and then I get into to do more 50 percent. Like writing the scripts again. Then, as you said, you need also domain adaptation. And. Yeah.",
            "So these days there is no way to do the quick domain adaptation that we used to do?",
            "No, not quickly. Like single person, not like a key person.",
            "And it used to be like that?",
            "It used to, yeah.",
            "That's. Okay. That is really a very big warning for for, everybody make. It is much better to have half the the mess in the files and too many copies, Then to have one copy somewhere, because accidentally can get deleted or or damaged. And it's then, yeah, okay. So the talk level domain adaptation is also out of question for the Fri for the Friday session, right?",
            "Yeah, that could be all released subject to worry right now, so. Like right now our main focus should be to get the pipeline and the whole system running successfully at least. You don't want to lose that. Forget about the domain adaptation level.",
            "Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And my last question bef before I let others speak well. It's stupid. Is if anybody has ever tried injecting sound output to an application which is recording the microphone. So, what we want to do is to. Imagine that I wanted to play a music to all of you now. So what should I do? How how should I send the sound from the Music Player whatever Player into the exip call. And I've read that player control should be able to do that. But I've actually failed. So I've found a link. So if anybody has ever experimented with with redirecting sound in Linux, please let me know.",
            "Yeah. Just give me a minute and I can try it.",
            "Yeah, Okay. So actually, I think that it works for everything. Except. I try it now. If you will hear some some strange Czech person talking instead of me, then I have successfully switched it.",
            "Do you hear something? So, did you guys hear something?",
            "I hear a Czech lady talking.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, we can h.",
            "Yes, I think PERSON12 we cannot hear you.",
            "And now you can hear me again and not the lady anymore.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "I think you change the sound setting and took the input from the monitor, right?",
            "Yes, but this was not possible with Zoom. So Zoom ignored this. So that's a problem of the Zoom platform.",
            "Maybe you could just br bring the Zoom on the Zoom developer forum and they they will probably reply to you even in like a day.",
            "They will reply. I saw some messages which where they said it's only in Windows and Mac OS.",
            "Oh, yes. That's that's the desktop kind.",
            "PERSON12, I think Zoom has. You need to configure the input sound for Zoom separately. So if you're seeing Zoom at the bottom left, there is a mike option. And if you click there is a. I will open a dialog box, which has a list of input sources. And I think you need to explicitly change it there.",
            "Okay, so. So if. So that. Let's lets dis discuss it later with PERSON6 when I managed to get to work. So I'll I'll get there around 5 I guess. And then we will try it. Ok, so it's. Thank you for for this test and yeah. It's always little bit more complicated than than we like expect. Yeah, okay. So with PERSON3 there is now no need to ask for for the domain that talk level adaptation.",
            "No. We should definitely have it in case it runs you know. I can like manually do the things. I can get it ready. So I I definitely want the domain adapted words to get, to have ready in hand at least.",
            "Okay. But we don't have. We never had the German ASR, right?",
            "No, no, no no. We we didn't have German ASR.",
            "So for English there is nothing to. There could be like our PROJECT4 talks that we could list in.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I'll think about it ans I'll ask PERSON3 what what he can prepare for for Friday. It's very very soon. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. So now, let's go over the list. So PERSON11. Oh, yes, PERSON11 is on mock con interpreting conference. I would like to join that when get to work as well. And he was reviewing the data from the past mock conference. Fixed some bug, going to. Yeah, yeah. So so there is an PROJECT3 submission, which we did. And there is still 3 days to update it. So,, and then. And then so there is some sense things delated related to the paper. Then, we should receive the feedback on our IW SLT submissions in 3 days, again. And then we will have 10 days to improve the paper. And the important thing is to work on the SLT deliverables for the PROJECT4. Okay, that's that's good. So I did it. I did the summary for PERSON11. And now, PERSON2, he is working. Oh, you are here, right?",
            "Yes. Yes, I'm listening to you more right now than to the conference so.",
            "Yeah. So was there anything you wanted to add?",
            "I replied to PERSON10 about the SLT yesterday by email.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And I fixed one bug in the back end ASR. So PERSON6 if you are using it, then you can pull new version.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I'm using it right now.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So, speaking at, still getting back to PERSON6 and the demo for the Project Officer. Who is available for or. PERSON6 are there tasks where you need a hand? Do you need some coders who would frantically help you in bug fixing?",
            "Like what kind of bug fixing are we are we talking about?",
            "Exactly. That's the, that's like. Is there something that you could delegate?",
            "I I I'm sorry. I didn't get your question. Like what is.",
            "Is there, is there something that you could get some help with? Like getting something running, getting to putting together script which whatever. Ways.",
            "Like some extra hand. Kind of.",
            "Yeah. Some extra hand?",
            "Yeah. I mean.",
            "I think the best would be if someone reviewed the scripts before the event.",
            "Yes. Yes. I would like kin kind of tester kind of.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So someone who would be kind starting the pipeline from scratch, right? Like on his machine, getting getting the same set up running.",
            "Yes.",
            "Is that the thing?",
            "Yeah, and just check the outputs whether languages are correct. Whether there are not some duplicated lines in the output.",
            "Yeah, I saw I saw the EN language text in in interleaved with in the Romanian outputs and things like that.",
            "So today I had an issue that the German to English PROJECT5 worker, it has been integrated with PERSON11's PROJECT6 wrapper and it it it. I mean it was running successfully until few days back. I tested it during the weekends but it was repeatedly failing today. And there is like a specific error which I see now and then or along with other workers also. I I exactly don't know how it is. Maybe when I I can talk to PERSON11 about it.",
            "Yeah, so. So the now in this call who would be available for this immediate help, and and bug fixing in the coming days? So I'm looking at at the list of you, who are present in the call. I can think only of PERSON1 actually and PERSON4. I think you're the the only 2 candidates, who could help immediately.",
            "But, maybe I what. Is there like some exact work that needs to be coded? I can.",
            "Not. Not yet.",
            "I can help to co code something if it's if you need hands PERSON6.",
            "But we are. Various debugging. For example the testing whether the port is free or not. So PERSON6 are we going to use back end ASR or are we going to use the old set up.",
            "Back end ASR. Back end ASR.",
            "Okay. So the back end ASR that connect to mediator and that's it, right?",
            "Yep. And if you're worry for the pipe like checking if the pipe if the port is and came on, I've already fixed that. In my current. So when I s at the check. When I start the PROJECT1 it starts locally, it first.",
            "It will tell you.",
            "No. It will delete. It will kill all the exi existing PROJECT1 server in there. And just start the new.",
            "This is again risky. Because imagine that you run the script where you actually want some other instance running. So, it's. This, yeah, this is the w. It is a working solution but it is a risky solution.",
            "Yeah. This is like, I don't know, I kind of agree, kind of.",
            "Yeah, so, but can we? I think it would be, yes. So what we could do, is that is that we would give one of the set ups to PERSON1 and PERSON1 should test it so that it runs. And another set up to PERSON4. If PERSON4 is here. PERSON4 are you are you on the call?",
            "Yeah I am here. I just I just don't know if I if I will have enough time. How how much do you estimate that it could it could be in hours?",
            "It's only until Friday. Friday at 10 is the event. So actually it's like tomorrow, and today tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and how much you can give. Because it will involve some learning how to run it.",
            "Yes, so maybe like I I have I have very little time these days. So maybe. If it woks, I can do it. But but if something breaks I can't guarantee that I will have the time to.",
            "Yeah. So, let's not count on you at all. And and PERSON1, you are you available kind of in these days?",
            "Yeah. I can ha, I will have some time on a Thursday. So.",
            "So, that's too late.",
            "Maybe tomorrow like evening.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So, we'll yeah we'll. Maybe we'll send you some some command that you should try running regularly and let us know if that worked for you or not. And maybe not. Okay. So that's. Yeah. So thanks. I I think that's that's that's it for now. We we cannot like do any any better. Oh, okay. Yeah. So. Now, let's lets move on with the with the progress report for the various people. So PERSON2 is maybe on the call, but it doesn't work or him. And then he is working on the analyses of IW SLT. And, yes. So that's that's it. There is. That's a lot of work to be done. PERSON6 is working on the preparation. The PROJECT6 wrapper, wh wha so so far you have not used PROJECT6 wrapper and you are starting only now? Is that correct?",
            "This weekend I integrated it and I'm using it from Monday. Whatever test we have done until now from Monday.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON12.",
            "Yep. Sorry could you. I think because I spoke with PERSON2 maybe if you can't you know if you can't you know. Make a.",
            "Look at this email.",
            "No, no, no, no. Maybe if you can give the de the details of this task you want, maybe PERSON2 can contribute also. Because he has some times this week, based on what we have spoke before. But he. Because I I think you should just inform him about what you want exactly about this.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So I'm I'm. So we have like three halve or quater persons yeah who who we could ask. Thank you.",
            "Yes. Okay, okay. So just.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. So the the PROJECT6 wrapper is now in as part of the demos, part of tests, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And the PROJECT2 model? So the delay has been fixed, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've I've tested it also.",
            "Yeah. So which.",
            "Ca ca can I just ask. Is it is it completely fixed or is there some some small still some small delay? Or is it completely.",
            "So, I have not run kind of like a regress tests. It was like maybe 2 or 5 to 7 minutes minutes of read recordings it played and it was pretty fine. And I could observe a significant im improvement.",
            "Le let me make a wo big warning again. We have now replaced a critical part of infrastructure, the PROJECT6 cache with PROJECT6 worker.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which behaves differently and also the PROJECT6 model going from PERSON13's to PERSON4, right? So you are now using PERSON13's or PERSON4's set up.",
            "I have both of them. Which is. I have both of them right now.",
            "And we have no idea which one of them is better.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And both of them are new. So it's, that -",
            "So basically I'll tell you that in terms of like. So basically both are like fast on ss same levels. But the quality? I cannot judge the quality. So someone has to do this.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "From the submission it looked like PERSON13's model was better.",
            "From what submission? The IW SLT?",
            "Yeah.",
            "But that was tested only on the Dev set, right?",
            "I think so, yeah.",
            "So, maybe I'm thinking what would be the best task. Would be the IW SLT test set indeed and everybody should translate the IW SLT test set with their models. So someone should do it with the PERSON13 ones. But we did we have this, right? So so we need only like a preliminary number from PERSON2, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Plain translation but the problem is that this this involves also the ASR set up. And we want to just assess the quality of the PROJECT6 system alone. And we have not fed the true correct transcripts to the PROJECT6 systems, have we? We have not, right?",
            "For some of them, yes. I think for all of.",
            "I think none none of the systems has access to to that. Yeah. So the task is is now, yeah, there is there is some to do. For a few people. So that's like to do for the demo. So that would be PERSON6 to fi or so PERSON2 to share with everyone the true transcripts of English IW SLT test set. PERSON6 to feed this through PERSON13's model. PERSON4 to feed this through his model. PERSON2 to evaluate it, right?",
            "In the terms of ble only.",
            "We have it, so.",
            "Yeah. So could this, could this be done today or tomorrow?",
            "Yeah. I I can use PERSON11's scripts which he used for IW SLT. And it it depends on how, how many files do we have.",
            "Yeah. It's not too many files. It's. And it should be actually the ORGANIZATION9 files and then the ORGANIZATION2 is not that interesting. Well, maybe to concatenating all? What about concatenating all? Yeah. And then we can split it afterwards. Concatenate it for PROJECT6 systems and split again before evaluation, right?",
            "You mean the voices, PERSON12?",
            "Yeah, yeah. The transcripts.",
            "Transcripts only.",
            "So the number of lines is fixed. It's only the ble evaluation. Yeah, so only ble scores. So the number of lines needs to be preserved.",
            "I have I have like. Which is like a quick to fix the Friday deadline. So PERSON7 said that she can review the Romanian transcripts. If if if we generate the transcripts of any video and an we can give her. So, what I say is that we give the Romanian transcripts generated from the PERSON4's model and from PERSON13's model and that PERSON7 decide which which one is better.",
            "Is better. Yes.",
            "Because we want to be sure of Romanian at least.",
            "Yeah. So here, here is the requirements. Common constraints, preserve number of lines, translate form English into Czech, German, Romanian. So manual check by PERSON7 and. Sorry a second. Okay, so. Manual check by PERSON7. And what else can we do with the list? Do we? We are going also from German into English, right?",
            "Yeah, so right now I am using that PROJECT5 workers and that was crushing today.",
            "And why PROJECT5 workers? Are they the best ones? Because ORGANIZATION7 has this World War II bomb, right? Yeah, they had World War II bombs found in their office so they have barred people from entering.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And it happens to be that that very office is very close to the server room where all the all the PROJECT4 systems or records are.",
            "So in the. To to make life easier in 3 or 4 upcoming days to make life easier, they are going to diffuse the World War II bomb found during reconstruction and they must not enter their building, so. And they also had some hard drive failure again so they lost some files as well. So this is like. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Everything crushing at once.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So. So please PERSON2 concatenate all for PROJECT6 systems. Transcripts of English and also German as the. And we also want Czech actually because we also have one system for Czech. Yeah, we want everything. So we want translates from German into English, translate also from Czech into English.",
            "Yeah, so we basically.",
            "Yeah, and then we will..",
            "Yeah, please please.",
            "Yeah, so so PERSON5 please ask PERSON2 to concatenate all the files in a parallel fashion and send and or provide 3 files to PERSON4 and PERSON6. One will be English, another one will be German and another one will be Czech. And all these 3 should be translated by all the systems.",
            "And then PERSON2 can evaluate them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This. So you need, okay, 2 files. One for all the and for all test sets, yes?",
            "For all test sets toge together, yeah.",
            "Yes, Okay.",
            "The whole IW SLT test set.",
            "Okay, okay, so. Maybe he is listening to us, but I think.",
            "Yes, please double check. Yeah. So this this should be done today. And today it should be translated with the existing systems. From English into Czech, German and Romanian. From German to English and from Czech to English. And then we will thrust the pivoting.",
            "Okay, yes. Just, who can. Who should receive these files?",
            "PERSON6 and PERSON4.",
            "PERSON6 and PERSON4, okay.",
            "Okay, great. And then we have PERSON9 and PERSON9 says that there is test data for almost. So, let's let's move on to PERSON9. PERSON9 are you on the call?",
            "Yes, yes I am on the call.",
            "Yeah, okay, so you could help us equally. Test data almost finished for 40 languages. Let's do this comparison as well. So, let's do it only for the English to..",
            "I just, PERSON12.",
            "Yes.",
            "I leave a call because I have a call and I want to answer the phone. Can I leave the call now?",
            "Yes, yes, yes. Than you. I think we have discussed everything. Thanks.",
            "Yes, ok. Thank you. Bye. Goodbye everybody.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON9 you should do the same thing as PERSON2 should do. Only going from English to the many languages. So, please have a look at your PROJECT4 test set that you are putting together. Concatenate all the English files in a way in which you can easily break it up back again.",
            "And then provide this long English file to PERSON4 and to PERSON6 and they should translate into all the languages that you have. So, what what is the set of languages that you have? So the. In your email. So, so the, please concatenate all the English files in reversible way, so that you can easily break it up again. And send to PERSON4 and PERSON6,, sorry PERSON6. So this file concatenated file, the names of languages where you have the target side. So this will surely be Belarusian and or whatever you have.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "And into all these in.",
            "All those files are not validated. Only 4 languages are validated by the annotators. So.",
            "Yes. Are are the files at lest parallel?",
            "Yes. But, I am not sure because yeah some sal some files have 1 sentences and some files has 2 has 2 sentences in the target and source side. So. So that's a problem maybe. So that's the reason I co discussed on Friday if we can assign.",
            "Let's preserve the line for line convention.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "Let's not care if there is more sentences on one line. Some of the systems will survive that and produce more lines, more sentences. But they must always produce the same number of lines. So it is critical that the number of lines remains correct.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON6 ant PERSON4, can you make sure that this holds?",
            "Yeah. This is focus, this will be the focus after after Friday right I do it.",
            "I wanted this to be. To help us to decide which system to use. But you're right that it's safe to give this task only to PERSON4 and not to you, because you need to debug the pipelines.",
            "Yes, because you wouldn't want to risk the whole system.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and PERSON4 you have never run anything through mediator or have you?",
            "I have but I don't know what to run and,. Yeah, maybe it won't be. Just. I I think that it would be just simpler to just do like a visual test. Like, like have the have them in the on the website. Like like in two columns and someone who knows the language would just see directly. I think that.",
            "It's not that simple anyway. Because it's like circulating 40 emails to 40 people. It and asking for their judgement.",
            "Okay, okay. Sorry. I I meant like for Romanian or or something. Okay. So.",
            "Okay. For Romanian, we'll do this for Romanian.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think we have Romanian already evaluated in different. Maybe I need to check.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "I have a Spanish, Spanish and Spanish data.",
            "So anyway, PERSON9 please make sure that your, that you have as many languages parallel. Like line for line. That the number of lines matches and concatenate the English side and send it to PERSON4 and PERSON6.",
            "Okay.",
            "And also let me know where the references are. And be ready to receive the translations in all the many languages. And if we succeed, if PERSON6 succeeds, then we will give it to you and you will score it. With against the references.",
            "Okay, sure.",
            "So, actually none of these test sets are multi-parallel, correct?",
            "Some we have 22 languages, not only 20, 22 languages have multiple multilingual parallel. Like ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION3 data is equally parallel but equal translation so we can use this data.",
            "And it is ar all committed in the properly committed in the directory, right? In the PROJECT4 test set. Or is it still floating around somewhere?",
            "Yes. ORGANIZATION5 data is already uploaded on the data in the PROJECT4 test set. And I think,, if I'm correctly reme if I remember correctly so Polish and some Spanish and Cata Catalan is already uploaded on PROJECT4 but some languages are n are not uploaded. So I will upload maybe tonight or tomorrow.",
            "Not maybe but for sure and do it within an hour, okay? Within an hour after the call. And I'll I'll have a look and you. So so the assignment holds but there is a pre-requisite, before concatenating the files, put everything into the repository. And then do the concatenation. Essentially, send us the command line that does the proper concatenation. So that we we will do the the clone get clone and we will concatenate it ourselves. And send us both, the output of the concatenation and the command line to run. And we will compare whether we got the same thing. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "So test data. Please concatenate so actually it's. So please, there is one thing,,, make sure to have all current test sets components. Current test sets components pushed to PROJECT4 test set repo. Send us the command to concatenate the English sides and send us also the output. Of the concatenation. Yeah. And that's so that we can compare. So that we can double check we got the same thing. The. Yeah. Reversible way. Yep, yep, yep. So this is all. This all has to be. This all has to be done in a reversible way and sent to PERSON4 and PERSON6, right.",
            "Okay. Please, if you just really coul could make it as simple as possible for me because I really really. I'm trying to do all the those stuff at once, so.",
            "Yeah. So for PERSON4 it is a. It should be one plain text file in English from PERSON9 that should be translated into all the languages in your model. And for PERSON4 it should be 3 input files from PERSON2. One in English, that needs to go to all the languages but we need Czech, German and Romanian. One in German that needs to go in English.",
            "And one in Czech that needs to go to English. And this is it. So it should be 4 files for PERSON4, right?",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "German to English? What what model is it? What model are we using?",
            "Well, PERSON4 has a German to English model as well. It is multi, it's English to many and many to English.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So English is the pivot language, okay, okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Okay. Okay. That is fine. Okay.",
            "So PERSON6. For PERSON6 it should be these same 4 input files but PERSON6 should run on for now only for those files from PERSON2 and not fight with the with the with the PERSON9 file yet. And I will try to help with that.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "And update with the Czech segmenter is that so I observed that the Czech segmenter is segmenting. Sorry. The number of segments in the okay. Okay, so I manually. I segmented and punctuated a I'm lost. So I punctuated and segmented and punctuated a transcript using my segmenter which has also been also punctuated manually by you. It was one of your ORGANIZATION1 lectures back in back in back in months. And it has more segments than a manually That's good. devised transcript.",
            "That's better.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So you have this new version and that that seems to have a higher recall than even the manual one. Or whatever. Okay?",
            "So I I I I have no nothing as of like Numbers. experimental data which says it has a more recall than a manually devised transcript. Kind of. But you. But I I visually I visuall I visually observed this.",
            "Yeah, that's better.",
            "So, this that's better, yeah.",
            "Okay. So, let's let's quickly finish the the rest of PERSON9's contribution. I'll be finished, hoping to be finished tomorrow. Promised this Sunday to finish it today, but unfortunately it didn't happen. Yeah. Cross examination of annotated data sets. So this is now going to happen very quickly in this test concatenation. Yeah, and we we still. Yeah, I need to revise the emails. But the demo for the Project Officer is now little bit more urg urgent. Yeah, building the test, filling the rest of the test data. Assigned tests to annotators for evaluation. Start preparing synthetic data. Yes. Yep. Okay. That's good. And PERSON4 worked on the performance fixes. And now will translate the the 4 files. Yeah. Okay. I think, I think that's it for today. We'll be kicked in a minute, I guess.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So thanks everybody for participation. And PERSON1 we may ask you for some assistance later on, when we decide. And I need to wait until my daughter comes so I'll come to the office only later. So PERSON6 until when are you in the office?",
            "Maybe 7 or 8.",
            "Yeah."

            "The to the document, to live document. Should I share the screen? I suggest not to share it, because that. Oh, I'm streaming my face already. So, that is the screen will be actually less demanding on the screen. It will be less demanding on the network.. Okay? So we have started recording. The first item on the list is to just mention that we have successfully delivered the delivery rules that we were expected to deliver. To deliver there was two on ethics and two on the website. These deliver rules, especially the internal website this is for us. So if you are failing to find some information on the project. Obviously, you can ask us whenever you like but you can also just remember where the internal website is and then look it up there. And that will give you a brief overview of that. Yeah,, with for listed this publicity achieved the thing. Just make everybody aware of the DU collecting where we have presented our work. And If you have done something, please add yourself. There is the ORGANIZATION4 workshop in Luxembourg PERSON4 and PERSON10 are going and if I'm not mistaken. PERSON7. As a substitute for PERSON14 is going. If this is the ORGANIZATION4. Sorry. If this is the ORGANIZATION4 workshop by organized by PERSON3. I was asked to yes. So we have we have a. So this is this is the important bit. Everyone please enter these activities into this ORGANIZATION5 sheet. And I hope it will actually open. This is the numbers that we will be entering into the official portal. What were we are also under. And this is for us to have an overview, and also for to see our spending. And the impact, specify the estimatated number of persons to reached. I do not know where they use these. What're they use these numbers for. But it just good to have a record of what have been done. So if you go anywhere. If you bought something somewhere, check this spreadsheet, and, if it is possible please add the item as well. So we have been at the fair of student firms, and thanks again to ORGANIZATION2 and to ORGANIZATION1 for coming in person as well. And the result of this is obviously the pub the little publicity, the little news item or block short block that we have on our PROJECT6 website now and the video in preparation. So we have. We have also recorded some short movie and we are now editing it and will post it. So this will be like one more opportunity to. To maybe, to about that. So this if for ORGANIZATION9. Who are managing the the presence.. And I feel that we are doing some things without telling the ORGANIZATION9. So the ORGANIZATION9 cannot really do the do the broadcasting and the attack of social networks. So everybody, please, don't repeat this error and let ORGANIZATION9 know so that the media is full of us. Another such opportunity, halfway missed opportunity is this conference of the interpreters director general, the G interpretation or sick in Brussels. I was there. Two weeks ago, I don't know. It's it has been recorded, and it is you can even look at what I was saying. I used the PROJECT6 slide, so there was clear promotion, someone told me that they saw me on Twitter. I'm not following through it at all. So maybe, knowledge people will know how to look this up. And this was an opportunity to retreat. So maybe we could still retreated now because the video is available. And I find it interesting for our purposes speak English. And it is you can also select the German channel. So I can listen to myself speaking German. So this is I'm telling this not because of my speech. But because of the various conferences that are signitadly interpreted. And and this would be an interesting data source for, especially the work package on the spoken language translation that ORGANIZATION8 is overseeing. So just keep that in mind. That there is such a resource, what is missing is the transcripts, but with the ASR quality surprising humans, I think the transcript should be readily available with the only very few errors in year from now, also thanks to our contributions. Hopefully. So this is a valuable type of data source, ok? Then there will be the workshop, do you know the date? Can someone add the date? It will be some May.",
            "June the 20th?",
            "June?",
            "Yeah.",
            "June. June twentieth. So just before our, drive run the PROJECT4. So which is working group on value added tax. Finally, that's it for that workshop abbreviation. So if you have anything else, please add it or please let us know. Yep. Then another thing that we have achieved is paper submissions, so well. I already read below in the list that there is actually a paper accepted to tackle bike it. So we have only submissions, not not accepted papers, and too much less important venue speech in dialogue. One of them is a micro review of minuting. And another one is on the little speech test, on the little speech corpus that we collected at the student fair. And this can serve as the test corpus for various. For English ASR for non-natives. So if you have any other papers, please mention them here. Later on, when we come to the official reporting will obviously need all the details and all the papers. But this is just quick preview of what is happening. Then the milestones. We know about the delayed milestone on recording in ORGANIZATION9 platform. Officially check with PERSON18 and he said it's ok if this is delayed, thank you for the explanation. It was important for me to deliver the explanation. About the goal language and our lack of that in the rest of the team. And he said, just tick if off when you are done. So I would like to know from ORGANIZATION9 what is the status of this milestone now.",
            "Ok, this is done so far, we have, working prototype online. I think we invited you to have look. You can take a look anytime.",
            "Oh. I missed that.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "Can you, if there is some URL, could you paste the URL here?",
            "Yeah, this would lead you into our conferencing client. So you from must make sure you have ORGANIZATION9 installed first.",
            "Ok, so that would not work.",
            "And then you are inside the client. There is two limitations basically. As a guest, which you are when you join with the link provided,, it will only react to English, because that is predefined for guests. And then there are only two workers available, right. So only two simultaneous audience streams can be processed on the far side. So that's that's the current status, it is working. The only thing that is not working reliable or reliably is that the audio is actually being picked up by worker. By, you know, this is a piece of software that is, you know, part of this whole, the voice system. And they on currently, not fully reliable, reliably picking up the audio stream that is something we have no influence to. And, yeah. We will have to wait until ORGANIZATION1, or I do not even know who is responsible to continue working on that. So from our perspective, we're done so far. We've wrapped,, the API connector into, into the goal programming language. And we can now transfer all to you. And basically the recording can now be done on side.",
            "Ok. So this is the set up that we wanted. That's that's very good. So I think that I should tick the, tick the, milestone checkbooks. It is in the system now, because in principle, it works. But it is not reliable. And the lack of reliability is like a package loss, so network traffic, so that paket get lost, or the way to mode this.",
            "That is that is an unclear. I must say that the developer that is actually working on this part is now on vacation. So all I have left is his comments on the on the start, as he did not comment on what exactly is the issue here, or what he thinks the issue. I just have the working program. I can even screenshot, if you want to. And then I can see and show you the output of the PERSON9 side. But I do not think it is necessary, right. You can you can test this out yourselves and I will provide the link.",
            "So.",
            "The issue lead into the worker. Do you mean something related to the worker processing the you sending or.",
            "I think exactly, that is the problem. Yeah.",
            "And you can provide the information about the worker you're using, I mean the fingerprint you using. We can interact with the provider of the worker, ok?",
            "Okay, yeah,, we do that afterwards, I guess or. Yeah.",
            "So I won't tick it off yet. I will wait for the detailed answer from your colleague, who is now on vacation. And I'm sure that you will find way in the like a week or two so this should be easy to handle. What was not very clear to me is the limitation because of the workers. So there has to be as many English channel processing workers. I have. As many participants join the room, or how does it work in practice. So if we want to record our session right now, there two, four, like ten of us here. I can't hear at all. So there is a drop off. I probably stop my camera, just to stop that right now. There is like ten more bugs. I will stop my screensharing just to save the network bandwidth. So maybe there is an issue with the network because I have to be on Wi-Fi unfortunately.",
            "So maybe, maybe I can my impression.",
            "And also, there is probably someone who is ecoing the. Someone is using loudspeakers. So if you are using loudspeakers peace mute yourself at the same time, unless you are talking, obviously. So PERSON9 can you,, can you talk now?",
            "Yes. So what I think the problem is all the limitation is if you have two workers, but can receive or process audio at the same time. You might end up with no worker available. If there is multiple person's speaking at the same time, or having an like like, a heated discussion. Then I would, then I would say, \"you would need more like four workers to be available, because after you stopped speaking. This worker stays assigned to your audio stream for probably probably like five seconds. So this is then reserved, and someone else starts talking and another worker has to jump in and pick up this audio. So far what I understood. I might be wrong. But that is what, what I'm so far.",
            "It's correct, do you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We usually stopped at least five to ten session per workers on our side per language. You know to be able to handle multiple concurent stream. So, if you wanna. If you need more than two, we have to check with PERSON11, how many workers they can start on the. And to connect to the media to, you know, to make available more simultaneous channels.",
            "So this is important for. Sorry to interrupt, I'll wait.",
            "Yeah, PERSON21 from ORGANIZATION2 here. Is also here. So we currently do have to work as running or as I interfere. We can't scale this up. But we do have other obligations that we need the processing power for, such as the ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You don't have these workers on multiplying. For these meetings so we can scale up the services to have more copies and have more workers.",
            "I think it's totally. Yeah, I think it is totally OK for the testing to have just the two workers. So, it would be. Will be testing it with one person speaking only. So this should work well. What we need more for the project purposes and for the session to be running ORGANIZATION9 would be the recording client. And if I'm understand correctly was the recording clients. It would be the same thing. So that each utterance, whoever says, it will be picked up by one of the recording clients or would be different.",
            "Each. It is a each stream it's each channel. Each channel. Difference.",
            "Yeah, ok. So that's different, so the ASR workers are like jumping on the streams, and there is so far no language diarization so that the workers do not know a day all assume that only English will be spoken for now. This made later change for the real test case was ORGANIZATION9 doing the remote meeting so that when the person logs in they would say, I will be only speaking German, or I will be spoke speaking German or English. And then the workers we should like figure out how much we support this. I think it is totally fine for, for the presentation purposes to say that a person, when a person connects to the ORGANIZATION9, they, have to say their language, and it will limit the workers to the language for that. It will limit workers for the language. For. So the workers for ASR are jumping on the channels as they start producing signal. And they leave the channel after five seconds of silence. And for the recording purpose is different. It is every channel gets recording worker. So we need to have just as many recording clients, as there will be participants connecting to the to the room. And this is something that can ORGANIZATION1 easily set this up or can anybody set this up and connect to the same mediator. So this was a question for ORGANIZATION1 probably. If we like. I'm checking when should. When should be the next call of PROJECT6 what needs to be set up. So that we actually run the PROJECT6 call in the ORGANIZATION9 platform and we have the separate channels recorded. So what needs to be done for this for this purpose.",
            "PERSON14, are you asking ORGANIZATION1 or ORGANIZATION9.",
            "Yeah. I think to ORGANIZATION1, because ORGANIZATION9, as far as I would say, are probably done as, like except for the, low reliability, but that maybe also does not affect the recording workers.",
            "Because in fact as part of the simple connector the is also the audio recorder client. The audio recorder worker. So it is a matter of launching of running the audio recorder. We will soon fingerprint and been to run the ORGANIZATION9 integration with. That fingerprint to also add the recorder to the to the chain.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, well. What but nevermind.",
            "That is. That is basically the same process as we did with the. The the transcription of worker. For the-for the recording worker, did I understand that correctly? Is to set up the recording workers.",
            "You just have to run the recorder client. It's worker. Adds the recording feature to the to the engine for the.",
            "Ok. That is important information. I think that was not clear up until now.",
            "Yeah, okay. So anyway, I think we are on very good track. And this will be resolved soon. So please let me know when I should finally tick off this box, and essentially a dry run call in ORGANIZATION9 platform with the recording capacity and recording correctly collected has to be carried our for me to tick this off. So this is more important for the milestone, the recording than the ASR. The ASR is also needed to on. So it is great that you have done that. But the recording, it is the thing that the most on check if I'm not mistaken.",
            "Okay.",
            "OK so thank you. Let me know again. Share my screen hopefully this will work. And Yeah. So there is the upcoming deliverables and milestones. There is deliverables timeline, a sheet that is the another deliverables DMPs. So this it the upcoming deliverables. So everybody please have a look at this and keep regular looking at this, so that you know what is coming. And here in columns. In columns O and others there. We would like to see who are the authors of this, who are expected to write each deliverable and also his volunteer to review those. All the upcoming deliverables are by the end of June,. So there is still a a quite a lot of time. But it is is good to know about them and start writing them early. We need to deliver them by this date so. And remember there is this PROJECT4 workshop so we will be very busy at the end of June. So I think that internally. We should aim and having this deliverables written ideally, by the end of May. So that the review. So that the internal review can start. So I think this is actually a month earlier. And that should give us enough time and have June relatively peaceful.",
            "Also please the column M. So there is the word package leader. So like the last three columns need just fill it in.",
            "So the upcoming deliverables are - one of them is on initiall training data separating confidential and public version of that data. This is that something that ORGANIZATION8 is, would be putting together. Obviously, everybody will be contributing. I just wanted to comment that either this deliverable or the data management plan, which is the eight point three. They should mention the PROJECT6 testsuits that we created for this WMT and also the Antrecorp, which is the speech test corpus with the high school students. So this is just so that we don't forget those. So the data management plan. Is something that I just wanted to briefly mention. It is any type of data that is being collected for research purposes. And also just being use from from other sources should be mentioned here. This is to give an overview to the commission, what we are using, what type of resources are using, because data are important for others to follow us and so on. So this is something that will be putting together. But if you are using some data resources for training your ASR system, and all that these details would be nice to be aggregated here. We'll set up some form of template and we will fill that in and then we will see into what detail we go in general, we will be mentioning our corpus and ORGANIZATION8 will be surely mentioning simply the WMT training data and all that, but the. Yeah. We need to put this together in one way or another. And an other important deliverable is the periodic activity in finance reports. So this is again on us, but we will need input from everybody. And see also the administrative topics mentioned at the end of this document. So this would be essentially the time sheets and your spending that we need to report in that in that document. And this is the last deliverable is again on ethics. So far, we have not heard any complains about our handling of ethics. So our constant forms did not receive any negative feedback. So will just write it down. The only type of like negative feedback was that people did not agree with being recorded or providing the data, and that's totally OK. But in principle, it seems that we procedures as it's expected. And we also have upcoming milestones. Again, at the end of June, one of them is the first spoken language translation prototype by ORGANIZATION8. And here I just wanted to mention that I could obtain interpreting data without transcripts from lists mock conference by students. So the key question is whether we want interpreted data as a test set or not. We do not have to answer this question now. But it is it is something that should be considered for the spoken language translation. One thing I wanted to mention seeing for the first time, the live in interpreting. I realize that there is so much more content beyond words, that is actually being translated. So the interpreters are kind of reporting on the general mood in the room as well with their voice characteristics. And sometimes they are mediating the negotiation like pacifying the disagreeing parties, and sometimes they are not depends on the order or the customer asked for. So there is a lot more to interpreting than just translating transcribe speech. And this is important to realize and this also open space for, for future experiments. So in the long-term like ten years from now we should be thinking about training neuro systems synthesizing speech, so that even these voice qualities are transferred someway. That is why it is interesting to look at these data sets. So this is just the one remarkable the usefulness of that word package. Spoken language translation can extend way beyond just integrating ASR and into one piece of software. Yeah, so that is the that's the milestones on first language spoken language translation prototype. And another milestone is baseline MT models for ORGANIZATION7 Congress. And the this will require the data that ORGANIZATION8 have already collected. And we have started multilingual multi-target training systems, and PERSON15 will work on these many system after WMT has ended which is essentially now. So only ORGANIZATION8 and we have to really worry about the milestones. But otherwise we are a relatively early, in good standing. Yeah. If there is no comments to this then.",
            "Sorry I PERSON14?",
            "Yep.",
            "So we had our the baseline MT model for ORGANIZATION7 Congress.",
            "Yeah.",
            "About, that means that.",
            "So exactly.",
            "ORGANIZATION1's.",
            "I think I forgot the let me, well, where is my print out. There is this continous reporting this emanation I'm sharing this. This is only the work packages another milestones. Do we have milestones, yes. There is improve as dry run SLT for ORGANIZATION7 available in ORGANIZATION1 platform. No, as you see on line ten in this spreadsheet. The full integration is due end of November.",
            "See milestones are essential for us internally. I mean, I know we have to report them through PROJECT1, but. I mean it's really as you see, just going take a box.",
            "Yes.",
            "So it's really of that. Organizing ourselves. So that was my question, what do we want from this milestone. What should be.",
            "Yeah. So I think the best answer to this is in just the next item preparations for the workshop. And it's not mentioned here yet. But I think we should really aim and having as many target languages as we can. Up to these 43 for testing purposes like how much we we can handle the better. And with the, with the help of the students here, if I gain the interpreting students here, will also have interpreters, one or two, perhaps one re-speaker more so up to three persons at the at the workshop. So we could be following English, German and Czech if we have that finally, and we should be translating into as many languages, as we want. I've check with PERSON1, I've asked PERSON1 what nationalities are there of the participants attending this workshop. But I haven't received any answer yet. So that would be like the the lower bound of our goals, and the upper bound is to have the baseline systems trained without really much evaluation for all the 43 languages. As a test case, I would go for all, but I would not worry if I have only four systems doing decent job, and I would also not worry at the workshop, at the end of June. Only like three or four languages are are handle by the ORGANIZATION1 platform. And we see that it is failing for more because of whatever loads somewhere. So let's let's aim for everything. And let's see the failures, but not worry about them.",
            "Ok, I mean to me, most the pain is gonna be actually integrating with the ORGANIZATION1. I mean, we fill as you see in systems cover all language pairs but we don't really know how to get them to the ORGANIZATION1 yet. At least we have here that adress problem.",
            "Yes. This is something.",
            "-we could create one ORGANIZATION1 worker that could do at least one source language for languages, not very well, but it could do something like that.",
            "Yep. This is something that really needs to be negotiate at the technical level with ORGANIZATION1, because the ORGANIZATION1 platform is also not ready for multitarget language. One option is that we will create like rainbow packets that will contain all the target languages or more target languages, and we will have like selector clients, and the selector clients will receive these rainbow packages. From the multi target NT systems, and they will present only a portion of that, according to the choice of the user. So this is this is what we will exactly we have to discuss these details in during the rest of April and May, and the beginning of June to see how to do it.",
            "That sound, OK, that sound reasonable, I mean how. So you say we're actually gonna break this off, this is action offline.",
            "Yes.",
            "I actually figure out how do, whether responsibilities lying.",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok, good.",
            "Ok, so because will be kick out of this room shortly, well, I can actually leave into the corridor as if. But I would prefer to stop it, so I just wanted to say that for now we have. We can create private repositories, even for the PROJECT6 organization up. So if you want any private repository, and you, you can't create yourself. Let me know, and can created for you. And the preparations for the for the workshop. The, they are essentially running. And the larger things that need to be done is to have a testing mediator, which is actually done. So there is mediator that we can connect to. And that's the one that will be testing in five minutes from now here as well. We would like to have automated daily tests of everything. So we will put these tests suit, the cruse control together, but we need from everyone whoever has implemented any worker, to provide a sample test case. So please, commit these cases, as short batch scripts to the repository that I created for that, it is mentioned somewhere. Where is that, cruse control. That's the that's the repository, yes. In work package six I mentioned this repository. So please commit these test scripts there. And the critical thing is the presentation platform because we can no longer rely on the ORGANIZATION2 platform that we use for the fair, but we need to develop one for the, for the project. And I'm waiting for ORGANIZATION1 specification to review that. I will try to implement slides grabbing and streaming of slides. But I don't know how to do that really, I have to learn. And the presentation platform needs to allow selection of subtitles. So this is the technical discussion that ORGANIZATION8 also needs to be involved in. Like how is this internally done and also on the on the user interface, how that is selected by the user. I think we should always keep the user in mind, because if the user seek too many languages, they would not be able to select, they don't want to go over them. So this is something, some user interface issues that I wanted to make sure our like. That the platform is easily usable, and it has to provide some user integration of the selected subtitles. And the stream flights. So this is what we will be needed for the, for the workshop. And I'll let you know later on how the negotiations go in terms of ASR that we will need for that. Because that depends on the interpreters available. So in the in the minimum case, we would be only following the English spoken at that workshop and translating into language that we have. But as as very last that I said, let's let's aim for the most, let's aim for 3 ASRs and up to 43 target languages. And let us see where we fail. And this is the things that we will be worked on to have them confidently cover for the ORGANIZATION7 congress. Yeah, so now, five to the deadline. And I suggest that we don't go into the details of package already getting the input from each of you was very informative. So I would like to ask everyone to carefully read the comments collected your colleagues, over all I think that the progress is very good. We have. We are on track. I'm not aware of any issue. Is there anyone who would be aware of any delays at this point? Yeah, I'm. I think were generally doing well for yeah. I don't know if there is. The only red for the ORGANIZATION9 pro recording to work also legally well, remembered to send their production forms to ORGANIZATION9. So that's the only critical thing here. Otherwise I've mentioned everything. And if you don't have question at font.",
            "Well the last thing - I did time sheets. If everyone.",
            "So exactly. So this is where I wanted to just leave, and leave the timesheets up to you. So. Yeah, I think I think that we are on track, so eveybody please carefully read the status updates, especially where you are interfacing anyone, but read everything, so that you're aware of everything. And that would be it from my side. Right. So with I will stop sharing my screen and share my face instead. So I would say thank you for the call. But there I will still leave you entertained little with the timesheets just remind that you need to collect them, that's it. Okay.",
            "Ok.",
            "So thank you.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Thanks a lot.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Ok, so how are your time sheets? I know that each of you is having little bit different system. So, is everything ok with it? Because we will have to collect it for the periodic reports. So yeah, I just don't want everyone's doing their timesheets for year and half.",
            "I mean, our administration in general, in the top of the timesheets, we have been changing over project in the early months this year. So I'm not even sure that would be actually paid per the project in January or February. But I know at least till April paid by the project. The timesheets will be there and they'll be there before, before the 18 month deadline.",
            "Ok, correct, great. And ORGANIZATION1 and ORGANIZATION9? Till when do you need.",
            "Do you hear me, PERSON19?",
            "Yes, I hear you. Well, we will need them before the 18 months period but yeah, it should be done some continuously.",
            "Yes, just, just the question. The guy in the timesheet we have a our all internal time management system. So we have all direct of the time spend on the project. But in order to have one agregate timesheet that you need for the regular implementation to the UE. Do you have any format in which you would like to recieve the timesheet from us? I mean, do you an excel sheet.",
            "Yes, yes we do.",
            "We have some.",
            "We have a little bit more detailed timesheet, like form, excel sheet. Which, more detail than the your commission requires. But a few days ago, I was online watching conference about the administrative in horizon 2020 and they said that we have to like record the amount of time spent on work package and also the task, so I think our. Our timesheets is ok with it. And that we have there ever since so I can send it to you. Just to have a look if you are collecting everything in your system.",
            "Okay, perfect. Task, because I do remember that it's impor. It's essential recording the work package.",
            "Yes, we just want.",
            "Like in our version of timesheets there is the work split to the work packages and just down it's the number of task, like T 1 point 3, T 2 point 6, I don't know. Just what you worked on. And just more like informative, you don't have to like devite the hours between the tasks, just between the work packages.",
            "Okay, because I don't think I were recording system let the user put the time, to put the time on a specific task. On the work package it's where the task is...",
            "Yes. And it's also beca. Why we want this so we know that we didn't forget on any task. Kind of. Just for listen play, record them.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok. And I think that ORGANIZATION2 is also fine, right.",
            "It would be helpful if you also have the timesheet template so we can.",
            "Ok.",
            "-Information repeated. But otherwise you will. We have.",
            "Ok. So, that's it. So if you don't have any more questions, I think we're done.",
            "Ok.",
            "So we need the data protection from all of you. Some data are missing, I think just know.",
            "Ok Aline, so if you could just maybe write to the specific person you're missing the timesheet,, the concent form from. So.",
            "Ok. So I think.",
            "Yes.",
            "Fine.",
            "Ok, any more question? If no, so thank you all for today's call. And I will, I will trade Doodle for the next one. I think it should be around the end of the May. Like would be next suitable. Ok?",
            "Ok, thank you.",
            "So bye bye.",
            "Bye bye."

            "I dunno if -",
            "PERSON6, you have a muted microphone, maybe,, we cannot hear you because you have mu, because -",

            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So I think PERSON5 is saying something in the group.",
            "All the meeting links are in the meet. If they accept, they can easily get. With the invite.",
            "Oh, PERSON5 joined.",
            "Yes, I'm he I'm here. I'm here.",
            "Okay, so this is perfect. This is perfect. If all of us can join, can hear each other. Wonderful.",
            "Yes.",
            "It is much clearer, right?",
            "Yes, it's better.",
            "So I think,, PERSON2 is gone to,, PERSON3 to ask if he can join us. Are y PERSON2, are you there?",
            "It is some noise I guess.",
            "Yeah. PERSON5, are you in the seminar?",

            "It is this background noise.",

            "Yeah, I will I will do that. I will do that.",
            "Okay. Because I think if you also do that, you are also going to get that error. So I believe,, downloading each paper would be a thing then.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I think,, it's starting of October and,, it is high time I think, if you want to send the paper by December, we should at least start now.",

            "What's the problem? First of all, what's the problem with the cluster? You can access it or not or? Because we have to remove one the repositories, otherwise we get confused.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So can you download all the papers from ORGANIZATION5 and put them in in this template folder that I sent you?",

            "Trying to do that, but yeah. I will prepare some time to do that, but I will do that for sure.",

            "Yeah, I've not try downloading, I'm I was trying to find the papers in my system, so give me give me a bit, by today I will like,, either upload somewhere. Not in the ORGANIZATION5.",
            "It shouldn't you shouldn't take that long I mean it's like a bunch of files if you you just move them. It's like the ORGANIZATION5 is kind of problematic, so you better remove everything from ORGANIZATION5, the entire structure I mean.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I will do that. I said I w I will do that, hey? Yeah?",
            "The entire meeting summarization with literature folder is removed from there, because it's not good to leave files and data in different. So remove everything from there and try to upload them and we will.",

            "The PDF files?",
            "Yes, I think.",

            "I can do it, but you can also try.",
            "Okay, and,, no I just wanted to know, because I'm not well aware with the class settings so I just wanted to ice. I can definitely do it, but -",
            "But you have access there, right? Do you have access there?",
            "Yeah, I have access, yes I have access.",
            "But you can try then, why not to try.",
            "Okay, yes, yes, I will.",
            "You just go there and go to this PROJECT3,, folder and then -",
            "Uh-huh.",
            "Try to rename file, just remove something from the end of the file name, not the label. Use the label is important.",
            "Okay, so -",
            "Remove a word from the end of the file name and save it.",
            "Okay, I will I will. Do that.",
            "PERSON5, you suggested -",
            "I will try, if I.",

            "PERSON5, you -",
            "Yes?",
            "Suggested to put that in the PROJECT1 folder or in the PROJECT3 folder, which one?",
            "But first you should put it -",
            "PROJECT3.",
            "In the temporary folder and then you should start checking them one by one. It if it is relevant, then you rename it, you put the label, and then you move it from the PROJECT1 folder to the PROJECT3. Okay?",
            "Yeah, and one more thing,, PERSON4, we have to also see that if it is,, do a final check, if it's relevant or not. So you're gonna do it or -",
            "Yes.",
            "Er, should I do it?",
            "Everyone can do it for his or her own files.",
            "Okay, so, but we don't know what is a division of the papers. So because you are going to it's it's -",
            "But there is no problem.",
            "You gonna do for PROJECT2 papers, that's finalized, but what about the other paper, how is the division gonna be like, yeah?",
            "We divide by index.",
            "Coz I think.",
            "By index.",
            "PERSON6.",
            "We divide by index. Until now I'm until,, 44. So from 0 to 44.",
            "Okay, so it is fixed that PERSON5 would do PSD, so PERSON6 let us -",
            "Yes.",
            "The other papers like I have download, so,, let us _",
            "No, but you keep the same label, you keep the same label, but you just -",
            "Yeah, I will do that.",
            "Add more numbers.",
            "I will do that.",
            "Yes, so -",
            "Yeah, will do that.",
            "From 44 to 60 or I don't know, somebody else, and then from 60 to 100 somebody else. So we divide by index.",
            "Yeah, we can do that as well.",
            "So yes, so now please put everything in the Temp folder and remove ORGANIZATION5, and everything else. So I'm moving this PROJECT1 folder inside PROJECT3, yes.",
            "So send me the exact part now.",
            "Okay, I will send it to you now.",
            "PERSON2, I think she left or what? She went to PERSON3 to ask for us to join?",
            "Yeah, I think so.",
            "No, I'm here all the time. I just -",
            "Oh.",
            "I just checked PERSON3, he was here and he,, has his lunch at the moment, and I ask s to call him after he comes back.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "PERSON5, can you mute from your end maybe?",
            "Oh, yes, sorry, I donno that. So the voice is bad, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I just send you the link.",
            "Yeah, I can see.",
            "So are you moving all the papers, PERSON4?",
            "Yeah, let me move all of them.",
            "Okay.",
            "Let me download it first and then I like move it -",
            "Okay. Just check if. Just try and open, because if you just download and directly upload, it will be problematic, because that,, entire,, archaic is corrupted. So first open it and check and then upload. So I think maybe,, that can be an instance that,, your internet went well while you were uploading or something like that, That's why the problem occurred.",
            "Maybe.",
            "So PERSON5, are you only t from the PROJECT2 or only taking the meeting summarization,, papers I guess, right?",
            "Not just meeting. Usually dialogue summarization.",
            "Okay, dialogue and meeting, that?",
            "Because we cannot restrict that much, otherwise we don't get papers.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "We cannot find papers that are very only Cloud meetings. We have to expand little bit.",
            "Okay, so only,, meeting summarization and dialogue summarization, right?",
            "Yes, dialogue is more generic, because meeting is a special type dialogue, so. Yes, you can search with meeting summarization, dialogue summarization.",
            "Okay. So how many papers are there in the PROJECT2 folded for,, like,, e in an approximation?",
            "Until now about 45.",
            "Okay. So should we restrict the years maybe? The number of year,.",
            "No. All of them -",
            "No, we should not?",
            "In the last 20 years it's not problem.",
            "We're considering,, the last 20 years?",
            "Yes, the last 20 years.",
            "Maybe we can consider 10 year or so to restrict the domain.",
            "I wouldn't restrict everything, because anything because they are few papers actually.",
            "Okay. Okay, I think,, PERSON4 will do that,, do we have something else to discuss today?",
            "No.",
            "So I don't have anything new from yesterday.",
            "Oh, PERSON5?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And PERSON4? Yeah.",
            "So I started with this,, spreadsheet that you have.",
            "Yes, I did see the changes as well. So I think they're more relevant.",
            "Yes. So, can I delete your 3 lines or you are going to -",
            "Yes, I will I will delete that.",
            "Yes, and put the head there in the,, you know -",
            "And, okay.",
            "Yes, I will make the changes. Yes.",
            "And one more thing.",
            "I will.",
            "When you -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So,, when you find when you check these papers are relevant or not -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And decide that yeah and you decide that one of them is relevant, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "First you put your unique label, as I showed. You put the unique label and move it to the right folder.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And you should also given that you decided to keep it, you should also find the pip tag and your best paper. Okay?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "The pip tag record. And put it to the file.",
            "So one thing. PERSON5? Yes, I want to ask 1 thing. That the way I was approaching it was I was,, copying the pip tag,, in the ORGANIZATION2 document. And,, the label of it in the Excel sheet, so that we can easily find it, and we don't have to double, do that thing.",
            "You put both, in the Excel you put both. The label and the, the record and the title of the record as I did. You can check the Excel sheet now. I did it for about 30 papers.",
            "Okay.",
            "You can check it now and you will see.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Can you forward the Excel sheet somewhere?",
            "PERSON4, I'm shared with you. It is called as automatic minuting. You already have it.",
            "I will give it to you right now. I will give it to you.",
            "Go to your shared Excel sheets and it is there with you.",
            "Check the messages in ORGANIZATION5, man. PERSON4, you can check ORGANIZATION5 mess connect?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Okay, so I'm transferring the all the papers now.",
            "So how many are the total papers? There.",
            "So it is gettin it's getting transferred to the - I don't know. Including PROJECT2, I think, because I moved some of the PROJECT2 s papers there. Overall there are 78.",
            "78?",
            "No, the last go the l the last label I've used is 47. So y.",
            "No, it's the papers that I -",
            "No, no,, PERSON4, I think no, no, I think,, there are PROJECT2 papers as well. If you're considering them, I think,, something around 70.",
            "That's what that's what I told, that including PROJECT2 papers it's 78.",
            "Ok, no problem.",
            "Okay.",
            "That is not the total PERSON5?",
            "So remove the PROJECT2 papers.",
            "Of only meeting summarization.",
            "So I think,, PROJECT2 papers are done by PERSON5. So besides that how many papers do we have?",
            "I have transferred it.",
            "No problem, I'm doing it, no problem, I have access now, I saw your -",
            "I'm gonna start to transfer? Maybe if it's transferred -",
            "No problem, don't touch anything.",
            "And I'll check.",
            "It's still corrupted, buddy.",
            "Wonderful.",
            "Your zip is corrupted. So y.",
            "It's transferred -",
            "ORGANIZATION5 is messed up.",
            "Donno if it's not yet transferred, let me transfer you the full, then please open, okay?",
            "Okay, yes, it's being transferred, yes.",
            "But,, PERSON4, did you check that? By opening. Was it opening now? Archaic.",
            "Yes, yes, I open all the papers.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, I did that.",
            "So it's transferred. PERSON5, you can check.",
            "Okay. Okay. Finally, it's okay. I will upload them, no problem now, don't worry I think I take care of this.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So you also have slides?",
            "So how many papers -",
            "You also have slides? Yeah, some of the slides. So it's 79 parts, but probably there are duplicates. So I'll try to remove.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So maybe I think,, PERSON5, just let me know that, how many after PROJECT2 how many papers we have. So that,, we can divide first 20 or 30 I'll take and the rest remaining,, PERSON4 can take.",
            "So please,, this division is not right. The time for division. First, you have to see the papers, relevant or not, and keep the relevant ones, label them, and then we can check the labels, and then divide them by index. So don't worry about division right now. First start -",
            "So maybe I think the relevance can be checked once we whe once we make the entries in Excel sheet. Why to waste an extra time. So once we are making the Excel sheet and reviewing the paper we can check if it's relevant, if it's not relevant we can just remove that.",
            "If it is relevant, you rename it, you put a label and those who put the label in Excel sheet and the pip tag, you also find the pip tag. This is better done at the same time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "At the same time.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay? So, yes.",
            "But I think,, first checking the relevance and renaming will take an extra effort, so. Once we are revu, reviewing, we can rename it and check the relevance. If it's not relevant, we'll remove it.",
            "You don't rename it if it's not relevant, please, don't use the label if it is not relevant.",
            "Okay.",
            "First check if it is relevant. Then use it.",
            "Yeah, so like,, if we divide it, I can check for 20 papers, if it's relevant, and to the rest of them,, PERSON4 can do it.",
            "Maybe we can the select some which we want to review. And then divide. Not random.",
            "This is what I'm saying. Please, first check the relevance. If you see that it is relevant, put the right label, find the pip tag entry and put the label and the pip tag entry in the pip tag file and then Excel sheet, okay? Then we will divide. Then we will see all labels, all numbers and divide by index. Okay?",
            "So bah the label the labeling, are you going to do that, PERSON5, or,, I?",
            "But you can do it, I mean.",
            "Okay.",
            "Everyone can do it. If you see an unlabeled paper, an unlabeled paper, you open it, you see you read the abstract title et cetera and you should see the relevance. If it is not relevant, leave it in template, put it in that let me create another. I will create another folder Not relevant, you move it there, okay?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So if it is not relevant, you move it in Not relevant, if it is relevant you put there a label and move it inside PROJECT3. Okay? And do the rest of that steps.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So at the end of the process -",
            "Yes.",
            "The PROJECT1 folder will be empty.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So PERSON4, do you have a full access in the cluster? Please check it.",
            "Yeah. I do that.",
            "Okay. And then PERSON6 should have also.",
            "Yes, I also do have.",
            "So I finish transferring the files.",
            "Transferring the files where?",
            "Yes.",
            "Where did you transfer?",
            "In the PROJECT1 folder. I open them I mean. So. Okay, now. So you have fiv 50,, 56 56 files. So 57, I think, 57 PDFs to be checked if they are relevant or not. As I yes, I explained, okay?",
            "Mm-hmm. But you can find more in ORGANIZATION1 I donno.",
            "And may I ask? What is PROJECT3?",
            "I guess it stands for meeting literature?",
            "Uh-huh.",
            "Review, yes, review.",
            "Uh-huh, okay, thank you.",
            "Okay, okay, so this is the task on us, like until tomorrow we should be ready with the labels. PERSON6? Is it okay?",
            "Oh, yeah, but I cannot do for 57 papers in a day, so probably can we divide that?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thinking because I've I have to read the ex, extract to the title to check the relevance.",
            "So -",
            "I cannot -",
            "1 thing, 1 further step, please. When you check all these titles, please go one folder back to LMR and see the titles that are already there to avoid duplicates.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "'Cause there could be duplicates. So after the label, you have the title. In PROJECT3. In all the papers in PROJECT3.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So at least the beginning of the title. So if you see duplicate, then completely delete the, the file you have.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "On PROJECT1. Completely delete it. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Then see the relevance and then check the put the label and find the pip tag entry, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Update the Excel sheet and the pip tag file in the ORGANIZATION2. So now, PERSON4, please, completely destroy the ORGANIZATION5 repository.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Please do it.",
            "Okay, anything else?",
            "Oh, would you divide that papers of I have to do it? I'm not clear about.",
            "Now you can you can you can do that. I will actually go through all the papers.",
            "But I -",
            "I'll let you -",
            "No, I because I won't be able to do it for 57 papers in a day, it is impossible.",
            "But you don't have to do it in a day, anyway, so. But you better divide, but you are not forced to do it in 1 day, so.",
            "Oh, because,,, PERSON4 mention that th, till tomorrow we have to do it, so.",
            "I wouldn't say that.",
            "So maybe,, maybe by the end of the week. Then.",
            "No, I was suggesting that,, we can divide the papers and then,, we can check the relevance. Because an I, we have to do,, the survey, so,, because I'm not going to do the survey of all the 57 papers. So let's divide that, and,, the papers you want to do the survey, you can analyze the relevance, and the ones which I have to do I will analyze their relevance.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it'll be better, yeah, because,, it will duplicate my task. So maybe,, if they're 57 papers, you decide which you want to do, like for top 50,, like,, drop half of it or. So it's totally your call.",
            "Yeah, I want to make first files and then decide.",
            "What?",
            "I want to make a first parts of the papers and then decide.",
            "Okay, okay, do let me know then.",
            "Mm-hmm. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay,,, what else?",
            "1 thing to note. You should be aware that it's not easy to find the pib tag sometimes.",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "And that you should find the right pip tag, like when the paper is somewhere in ORGANIZATION3 events, you put ORGANIZATION3 pip tag, not the, you know, not RQ of some other pip tag. So the official one possibly. Okay?",
            "Yes,, definitely we'll consider this.",
            "I just did I did it now for about 30 papers and it's not easy, it took me like more than 3 hours to find the pip tags.",
            "Yes, that's, that's why I was,, thinking that,, t, I won't be able to do for all 57 papers. Alone.",
            "Yes. And don't feel forced to do it until tomorrow. You better do it properly than quickly.",
            "Yes, yes, sure.",
            "So we have at the first parts we'll just rename those files and then we will put an entry, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "No.",
            "You see the relevance? You see the relevance? That it is relevant?",
            "So yeah, first relevance and yeah, then rename it, otherwise, we don't need to rename it.",
            "Put the label, put the label, yes, otherwise, you put it you move it in Not relevant folder. So put the label, move it in the right folder, and then check the pip tag, find the pip tag online, you put the pip tag in the pip file of ORGANIZATION2 with the comments with the commented label as I did, and then you put the label and the pip tag index in the 2 columns of a spreadsheet. In column A and column F.",
            "So,, in any of the column,, like who is going to review.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Does it matter?",
            "I think -",
            "No,, they shouldn't they like don't have to be ordered. You just put the right label and the pip tag entry.",
            "No, I think I think there should be other column that who is going to review what. That would be,, like -",
            "Like,, actually,, PERSON5,, earlier I did not add that lead column. And,, PERSON4 wanted that who did review this paper, so listed that any Excel sheet, so he,, made me.",
            "No, it should be it should be easy. No, no, no, I don't think it's. Like PROJECT2 up to PROJECT2 50 are mine, then PROJECT2 s 51 to 70 to 80 will be it's easy to do and I don't need to keep it in SpreadSheet.",
            "No, but I wan I don't want to do it then though, like if it is 50 to 70, it's not that I will do 70. 70 to 90 as well, I think it'll be good.",
            "Oh.",
            "Once again, please, raise your voice, please.",
            "Yeah, so what I'm saying is it's once we label we are going to do like 50 to 70 these papers. And I would do the 60 to 70, it's not like that. It's like that it can be anything within that 70 which all interests. Okay. So that's why I said that we have to that who's going to review that.",
            "So if that interest, than how we'll be able to do it in parallel? Because you can find any paper which I'm also reading, or PERSON5 is reading, so -",
            "Yeah, that's what, that's what I said, that we should. So okay, PERSON6, you are going to do this, I'm not going to do this, so I will do this, but. That's it, write your name. You are going to do this.",
            "What?",
            "So just I can be -",
            "I cannot hear you.",
            "That you were.",
            "Please, raise your voice.",
            "I am saying just write your n write your name against that paper which one you are going to do. Like PROJECT2 to 6 -",
            "No.",
            "We don't have to do it like this. We messed up like this.",
            "Yes,",
            "We will just -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Use a convention, a very simple convention. PROJECT2 1 to PROJECT2 50 let's say will be reviewed by me. PROJECT2 51 to 70 or 80 by somebody else from your. We just do it like this like we set it up like this and then we are okay. We'll see the number, the label, if it is in my interval I will do it. If it is in your interval -",
            "So, so that means s that means that PROJECT2 51 to 70 -",
            "Yes?",
            "Are the papers that I am going to review so that I need to, right?",
            "Not right now. First, you name them, then we divide them.",
            "So that's what -",
            "It was just an example, it was just an example I told.",
            "But if we are going to the division is going to be according to sequence, that what PERSON5 means, that. Like we will -",
            "In sequence, I don't think it be problem use to be in sequence. Why it needs to be in sequence?",
            "But. But if you find,, you pick up any paper which is interesting for you, that will be problematic.",
            "That's what I'm telling, that's what I'm telling that if you put a name, okay, it's or it might be interesting to me, but you are doing that. So I'm not doing that. It's a e as easy as that.",
            "No, it will be difficult to find all the, to en to find your entry and,, to get if you're also doing that same and I don't think it will be confusing, I.",
            "Why you think confusing?",
            "I'm not able to -",
            "You put your name. If you put your name against that paper if you are doing that, why it would be confusing? I'm not getting this.",
            "I don't know, okay, you ca it's your call, maybe we'll however you like you can decide.",
            "Yeah, that's what I told.",
            "I don't I'm not following you.",
            "I'm doing the first -",
            "I don't understand.",
            "Yeah, PERSON1, so,, PERSON4 wants that,, it should not be according to sequence, okay, once we rename we check the relevance, we are done, we have a list of papers, we have a folder of papers, relevant papers, and then to divide among us, all of us, We should not choose like first 50 are done by you, the next 50 are done by me and the next 50 are done by,, PERSON4, but rather he wants,, the division to be according to interest, so he can choose any paper which interest him.",
            "No, no, no, no, it's not possible to manage like that, we mess up, we conf, there is a lot of confusion, we cannot do like that.",
            "Why? I want to go no, I want to know that why? If you -",
            "It's very confusing, man, it's it's very confusing.",
            "It's confusing.",
            "We can hardly communicate right now. And how can we arrange? I want this, you want that, it's not -",
            "Can't we just write in the Spreadsheet I am going to do this.",
            "But it will be really difficult, I even I am thinking same. How can I how is it possible even.",
            "No, but I am not supporting this random assignment. So.",
            "No, it's not going to be random, -",
            "This is what it is.",
            "It's gonna be a sequence, like 20 these 20 papers you gonna do, these 20 papers I am gonna do.",
            "Oh, maybe, maybe like 5 or 6 doesn't interest me. So why, why would I do that?",
            "Okay.",
            "Why would I do that?",
            "Okay, you can do it listen,, the first 50 papers are already mine, okay? Are the papers that I have printed in my desk and I have read and I started to reread. So you can choose to divide them as you wish, okay. I just don't want confusion and waste of time, okay? So please -",
            "Yeah, okay, you do that -",
            "Label them as I said, label them as I said, I have the first 50 PROJECT2, 49 is the last one, and then you can discuss with each other, but please no confusion and no waste of time, okay?",
            "Yeah, that's fine.",
            "If you wanna do it like that, I do this, you do that, you communicate to the other and you sort it out together.",
            "Yeah, it's o it's absolutely okay. Yeah, it's absolutely okay. So it's it's also possible that like reading the top 50 that you have reviewed, I may be interest in some of them, so I and in any way I am going to review that.",
            "You yes, you can read them. Nobody forbids you to read the paper. You can read that, of course.",
            "So it's like.",
            "Sure, yes, okay.",
            "Okay, so, we have less than a minute.",
            "So in that case whatever, wha yeah, so whatever in that case,, do let me know which papers I have to do because I'm really confused and,, I have stopped the work since last 2 months of the survey, so I'm really stuck with it, and if you do that let me know which papers I have to review, I will do that. So whatever you decide. Just let me know which papers I have to review because I am waiting for your call,, since,, a month, and,, if y if you decide which papers you want to review and which I have to review, I'll be glad to know that.",
            "No, I didn't get this like you were waiting for my call, that you get this -",
            "Yeah, because you said that you want to do it according to the interest, And,, which paper interest you I don't know that and, -",
            "Yeah, so that paper has not been uploaded, right.",
            "So,, you can read that paper, you can read that paper if that interest you, but,,, making an entry in Excel sheet is not understandable by me, that if some,, paper interest you, you are going to do that entry and,, I don't have to do that or what I'm really not,, able to understand the idea that which paper are interesting you, you're going to do that survey.",
            "So, I'm not going to do a random review, like 50 to 70, so that is for sure. And, yeah.",
            "Now you have the lead you have the lead column in the spreadsheet, you can put the names there, so from PROJECT2 0 to to es PROJECT2 49 are already labeled, I don't put my name there, there is no need for name there in these papers.",
            "To the files that you have and then move them one by one to PROJECT3. If you read and see that there is an GitHub link with code somewhere you move it instead in with code folder. If it is not relevant you put it to Not relevant folder. So at the end of the process you should you should remove all the files from the Temp folder and delete them as not as the duplicates, either put them in Not relevant. Or just put them in PROJECT3 with the right label. Okay?",
            "Yes, okay, so thanks, I have to -",
            "And -",
            "Move for conference.",
            "And also and also find the pip tag and also find the pip tag and put it in the ORGANIZATION2. And at the same time, so it's it's a kind of,, little bit complex, because you also update the Excel sheet. As I did with the 2 columns, the paper column and,, and,, reference column. So you once again put the label and,, paper, and put the pip tag record title in the author reports.",
            "Yes, I yeah, I got that process, so I have to move for that conference, so -",
            "Just may I may I have a little remark, please?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I tried to listen to you and I,, fixed something,,, most of that discussion, into the agenda that we had,, made yesterday. Maybe I sent you the link maybe if you,, look at this organizing process I have. Tried it to try,, try to fix it,, up. So it should be there. If you just if you can use it somehow. Did you get what I meant I just said it a little bit a me in a messy way. The idea is that I fix the procedure of,, organizing the paper proposed by PERSON5,, in,, the agenda and I sent you the link. Wait.",
            "Didn't get this. What was the?",
            "Nothing, that I have just written it down if you need,, to have it fixed somewhere.",
            "What is this fixed somewhere, what is it about?",
            "I opened a link, sent you note at the chat.",
            "To the ORGANIZATION1 Hangout?",
            "No, to ORGANIZATION4 chat, but I can also send it to,, ORGANIZATION1 Hangout. I have sent it now.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "I don't have access here, how can I can how can I get access here in this?",
            "Ask me for access probably, if you can't open it please ask me for the for access.",
            "So yes, I ask for access.",
            "Yes.",
            "I will I will I will take a leave.",
            "So I sent the request now what.",
            "Mm-hmm,, just moment,, it take some time. I am working on it.",
            "Take sure like,, you two follow this I send it. Because if we are recording the calls I would use it as for our dataset. And if I use it for our dataset, I want to have some agenda or minutes. So it's about this call that is being recorded, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "And you record them, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. But you record them in ORGANIZATION4 you record them in ORGANIZATION4 or also in ORGANIZATION1 meet?",
            "In ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Only in ORGANIZATION4?",
            "Only in ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Okay.",
            "So now,,, can you see that now?",
            "Yes, I can see the document. So what's the problem?",
            "No, I have,, no problem. I have just said that I have fixed out the organizing and probably you would like to control it or to,, make it more detailed so that you can use it when working with paper. But you should not I just,, claim that I did it.",
            "Okay, it's fine.",
            "So if you see that organized papers for this survey proposed by PERSON5 should be done. By one of the authors to duplication. Work with papers in PROJECT3 folder and the address. Do not label papers which are not relevant if it -",
            "Put it in Not relevant folder. So just like that.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So,, PERSON5, I'm really confused till now. What I have to do? Because -",
            "I can explain it to you.",
            "It is not possible.",
            "I can explain it to you again. So -",
            "The procedure, I know. The procedure I know, -",
            "Yes.",
            "But if this if we implement this idea that,, I wou I am going to pick up any paper and I am going to do,,, the entry in the Excel sheet, -",
            "Yes.",
            "Then,, like what will be the w like I will be keep on doing that and which one will be done by,, PERSON4, I'm totally confused, the idea I did, like the idea y of your division. Maybe first 15, second 50 or I donno.",
            "Well, what can I say? What can I say.",
            "Now this is this is really confusing, I'm really,, -",
            "You will just,, put the names, put the names in the lead column and if you see that it has the name of PERSON4 you won't touch it, otherwise you put your name and you do it.",
            "Okay. I okay, I will,, follow the procedure which is classified by you and I think PERSON2 has also documented it, so there is no,, confusion into it.",
            "Yeah, so please,, remember to remove this,, first 5 6 lines in the Excel sheet, or kind of put them down and because it doesn't look,, really good now with this extra roll.",
            "Yes, yes, let me -",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Let me remove them. So I have to make an -",
            "Yes.",
            "Because I reviewed it, so I'm going to make the specific entries accordingly?",
            "Yes, if you already did it you can you can move them down, you can move them down.",
            "Yes.",
            "But you first have to label them, you have to label the papers.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so you should start by these 3 papers. Do first these 3 papers, labeling them, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And adapting the columns as I did down there, you know like. Okay?",
            "Okay.",

            "Good morning.",
            "Hi morning. Yeah. So it works, that's great. Yeah so who all do we expect to be in the call? PERSON11, and then possibly also PERSON4 and PERSON12.",
            "Possibly. For sure PERSON10 will join us.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We made the plan C working on our developments server.",
            "And plan C that's the like click all click according to the instructions.",
            "Yep.",
            "Ok. Yeah. So we need multiple solutions.",
            "Yep. I think that probably at the end we will use both of them. Especially if you would like to live translate the meeting.",
            "Itself. Yeah, and you're afraid of this.",
            "Ju well. From the work point of view, no, because actually it's not our ASR and not work machine translation. But from the personal point of view, a little bit. Because actually I know everything will work. But I also know that the polity of the output will not be that good.",
            "Yeah, but that's, the question is whether anybody has a better output quality. And I don't think that this is that is the case.",
            "Ok.",
            "So that's why I think it's like it's we're in the middle of the project, I think it's good to show where the state of is. And I I don't think that we're bellows the state of the art.",
            "Ok, nice.",
            "Maybe I'm like overly self-confident, but.",
            "Well, you know, you are you are the the head of the project so that. I will follow you, don't worry.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so let's let's see what the others will say. We can, I'm I'm not opposed like in voting on this for example. So that everybody has or even if even someone would like to have a veto voice that's that's fine as well. Yeah, so while while waiting for the others, because I have too many other things and I'll be like skipping of the call and.",
            "Don't worry.",
            "Again, I will like to join at 10 again. When PERSON5 is in. And so so that we know like how to proceed with with the real user or observer. And the question is what will we put to the agenda. I was kinda surprised the one they ask for agenda. Because I thought that we will just play this for you and and then you will like comment and we will say why it is so bad at or why does what it does.",
            "I was cared by the number.",
            "Number, yes so was I.",
            "What? People from ORGANIZATION3 site then the actual project people.",
            "It's not ORGANIZATION3. It's not ORGANIZATION3 people. This is all the this is actually worse for us in in a way. So. This is all the ORGANIZATION5 EC. So the.",
            "ORGANIZATION5, sorry.",
            "The the ORGANIZATION5 ORGANIZATION5 people. So it will it will be the various heads of the DG something. And.",
            "10 15 people.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah, exactly. So this I'm also afraid of of this. But imagine that actually in just 20 days from now, we normally we should have had 2 to 4 hundred people looking at it. So this 10 to 15 directors and the main heads of like supervising all our money flow is not much worse.",
            "Ok ok, it's a good point of view. Well my my idea now is to let PERSON10 and PERSON11 when they join us, prepare the demo for PERSON5.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you would like to join us for a pre-pre-pre-pre demo, so that we can explain you the the points and how it works.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then we will have the Romanian translation demo with PERSON5, at 10 o'clock. And then probably we have to discuss about the agenda and.",
            "Yeah, I'll I'll have to.",
            "Good morning PERSON12.",
            "Yeah, hi. Hi PERSON12. I really have to leave at 11 sharp. So that's that's another like complication but it's not the last day before the the demo day. But we should send the agenda at some point. So PERSON12 we're discussing that yeah we got a little bit scare from the number of planned visitors or or the the the size of the audience for the demo.",
            "Yeah, that was that's bigger than I was expecting.",
            "Yeah, and it will be all the all the heads of the various directory generals. So that's this is all our money for the next 2 decades. So we should we should use the demo in in decent way. And I don't know what to what to put into the agenda. So I think because it will be people outside of the project probably we have to briefly introduce the project as as a whole. Again like the the slide with the meeting summarization and this is again an option to make that call to action. So that they would donate us data. On the PROJECT2 webpage there is a new blog post. Which is on data collection. So PROJECT2 dot eu blog and it says \"Recipe for miracles to happen\". That's that's that. But it's just a technical thing actually. So if you have any institution that could have their meetings and could provide us with their minutes, then direct them to this blog post, because it illustrates what we are collecting and it will straights what what we're going to do with that. So the goal which will probably be accomplish only outside of the PROJECT2 time frame will be these regular workshop as we have for speech recognition, spoken language translation and machine translation to have these also for mi meeting summarization. And with these with the series of such workshops I'm quite confident that it will evolve to something usable. So PROJECT2 can only start this. But i think that I'll I'll mention this to in the demo session and whenever you're in touch with any institution note that there is already data partners at the very end of that blog post. If you're looking at it. There is PROJECT2, PROJECT1, and other project that we have. Ok that's actually they list a wrong one. But never mind. And the ORGANIZATION2. So we have some someone outside. Hi PERSON10. And they are giving us their weekly meetings which are run in ORGANIZATION4. In Czech, obviously. And they are also giving us the minutes, so we are collecting this data and lot of this data will will have to remain secure. We will see how much we can actually publish for for the competitions but this is collection that that we want to grow. So the more we can get the better.",
            "What what about the the recordings we lost in that.",
            "Yeah, they are unfortunately lost. So that's yeah. But that that was just 2 or 3 sessions, so not many.",
            "Ok.",
            "So that's luckily we didn't use that platform too often. Because they are strict with deleting the files and PERSON13 was too busy with preparation for various campaigns and I was also too busy to like supervise this unfortunately this, yeah. This is this is lost but that's luckily it's not too many.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, so we are missing PERSON11 and I'm not sure if I have his cellphone number. It's too early in the morning. For him.",
            "Also for me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON10, meanwhile may I ask you to prepare the German into Romanian plan C demo? So that we can at least start from here?",
            "Ok, so I'm already one button script for to invoct the streaming. So just. Well I need to search the map for the for the the path. So it's very early and.",
            "Don't worry. I also miss my coffee this morning.",
            "So I'm looking for the Romanian brai fingerprint right now.",
            "Yeah so, so PERSON11 will join shortly I think he didn't realize that he should be here from 9 for the preparations. He probably thought that the call is start at 10. So what do we put into the agenda for the demo session. The brief introduction of the project, the call to action for data preparations. And then maybe some so this is like outside of the demo itself. And then should we like prepare the the audience to something? Or should we first give them the demo and then discuss the technologies and their limitations, what will you recommend?",
            "I recommend to start from what actually works.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I suggest to start with demo. And then pass to the more to discuss regarding the the lack of the actual technology in order to conclude with the feature works.",
            "Yeah. Yeah I agree, that make sense.",
            "Ok. Call to action. I'm writing something in ORGANIZATION6 doc.",
            "There is some some issue with the agenda.",
            "There is the To do. In the to do to do list. The last point is the agenda.",
            "PERSON7 says that the document is read only.",
            "Really?",
            "But it it is not. I see anyone on the internet with this link and edited.",
            "Yes, I also see PERSON7 as editor.",
            "I see PERSON7 as editor as well, right. So maybe I didn't get. He talks about the agenda. Is agenda in other document? No.",
            "No, no no no no. It's on page 1 2.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "On page 3, the last point, exactly.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. That is strange. So PERSON7 has some strange link. Which doesn't really work for him.",
            "Oh I can re-share it, of course.",
            "No, but that's like he says that in the chat, so. So PERSON7 are you are you here can you talk as well? Maybe, maybe not, I'm not sure. Ok, so PERSON7 cannot speak, never mind. Yeah, ok. So I think that for the agenda I'll prepare some slides. That will be mainly re-use of of the previous slides. One of slides will say demo and then we will see what what exactly is in the demo. And the current plan is to have that TED talk that in German that was selected by PERSON4, right? And so it's it's quite important that people are not overwhelm with too many things to read. So we should really narrow down what everybody is will be looking at. Because we are quite experienced already with like following to too many subtitles at the same time. And we know that we need to disable them to to start accessing them. So if we overwhelm them then their only final impression will be just confusion from too much jumping text. If we are very strict, we can I think this this overwhelming is is useful as well. But we should first start with some limited view. Where they only see maybe the English generate out of that German. And only then expose them the all all the languages to them and then allow them to. So this is this is something that we need to choose. Whether they each of them should follow their mother tongue or all of them should follow English. Maybe all of them should follow English for a while. And or or maybe we start with each of them following their mother tongues. So we will give them instructions \"please, select the languages, select\"",
            "No no no no.",
            "No?",
            "The the demo should run in shared screen. This because there's no time to explain people how to.",
            "Click anywhere.",
            "In the, using correct the platform.",
            "Does this work? If you're really sharing the video, I saw it always to like jumping. The network was overloaded I the by the incoming. So so I don't think we can use the communication platform which should be probably ORGANIZATION4. For distributing the video. We can use it only for the discussion itself and then for the video people need to be independently watching.",
            "Ok.",
            "Otherwise the network will not not manage.",
            "This is something that we can test actually how to arrange it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "If the video it's stream the online for example with the M3U8 URL. It opened by browser for example. Or in the VLC software but actually it start a little bit more complex. I think that probably giving them the video to be could work.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Good morning PERSON11.",
            "Ok, so as I said I'll probably disappear from the call now, please go ahead with the technical preparations. And I'll re-join before 10. You can e-mail me in the mean time if I should connect earlier but, yeah. And at 10 PERSON5 will probably join. Did she receive the link? I'll send her the link.",
            "Yes.",
            "Just as a reminder. That at 10 we're we're expecting them. Ok, so thanks, so I'll I'm leaving the meeting now and try to.",
            "Ok, see you later.",
            "Yeah, thanks, thanks a lot.",
            "Ok.",
            "So, yeah, hi everyone.",
            "In, tell me.",
            "At 9 but I was not sure where to find the ORGANIZATION4 link.",
            "Oh, ok ok, don't worry, don't worry at all.",
            "So I.",
            "Ok, the next 40 minutes we have to prepare the PERSON5's demo.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "From German to Romanian.",
            "Ok, yes, I'm I don't seem to be able to find a path for that. I.",
            "Ok.",
            "There is no there is no Romanian output that can find. Register right now.",
            "Yeah, because I have restarted the system yet.",
            "Ok.",
            "So do you. So so I have prepared the plan B which is delivering instruction and falling the subtitles then. And yeah let's let's start it. So the source ASR will be English ASR or German ASR?",
            "ASR.",
            "Yes, We're we're using the same German video we've been using for a bit.",
            "Is is the one selected by.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah, don't worry.",
            "By PERSON4, let me check it please.",
            "So, shall I play the video from Youtube or from ORGANIZATION7 presenter?",
            "We will test both of the solution because we have also to display them to PERSON6.",
            "Ok, ok ok. So just let me know the the source of the video and I I'll start the.",
            "So we have trying plan B first and then plan C just in case, right?",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "No we will play both of them PERSON6's idea is to first demo pre-recorded video.",
            "So today we use both, exactly.",
            "Both but also they demo. Probably.",
            "Ok. Yeah.",
            "Because we want to show the pre-recorded video. And then we want to test non-native speakers live speaking. So that PERSON6 will speak and probably PERSON11 will catch the audio and pass it the to the ASR using plan B. Ok. I'm going to make a coffee or sorry. I'll be back in 1 minute. PERSON10, when you're ready, tell us.",
            "Yes or I'm I'm going to to leave in a bit, sorry for that. I'm leaving notes PERSON2 to you on the platform itself there's read me. Ok so I have a script which is set up to read the input video from that pre-processed file. So to not affect performances as much.",
            "As I'm going to connect and test it together with you in couple of minutes so that I'm sure that everything works.",
            "Ok, we can test it German subtitles right now or we can hook up the pipeline for the Romanian but I need a fingerprint. Is it online? PERSON11?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is the translator and what the other word, oh my god.",
            "Subtitler.",
            "No, ok the publisher is already online. I don't know if it it fits.",
            "Yeah, we we have a publisher for Romanian already.",
            "Yes, the fingerprint is is? I don't know if your pipeline is hook up to.",
            "Yeah, it is. And just on you. I will play the short video and we will see the subtitles as well.",
            "Credential. Ok I'm online PERSON10, where did you put the.",
            "Ok so in the home of the of wrote there is a an PROJECT2 set up. Ok? You can fi you can find.",
            "Wait wait wait wait wait. Ok.",
            "So there is a there is a general read me and read me just for you and then there is a one button set up script which does the thing.",
            "Ok.",
            "Well I'm editing the script right now so to where is. So to get the fingerprint. Let's see this works.",
            "At the moment. Set up. Ok do we have Romanian here, yes. A a and it's configured. Language we have Ro. Oh this is my coffee.",
            "PERSON11 can I ask you to to paste either in chat or on the document the fingerprint fingerprint set up you are using? Because I can't find it on the on the web page. Yes.",
            "Look from EN and should be corrects because we use English is it correct PERSON10? Yes. Good, really good. Ok. PERSON10 would you like to support me for one run?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok, I'm connected I'm here and I have to type just one button set up, is it first?",
            "Yes, I still need to input the fingerprint, the correct fingerprint so I'm very slow this morning I.",
            "Don't worry, do it.",
            "I.",
            "This is my coffee.",
            "PERSON10, by the way the correct fingerprint for Romanian and some of the languages have already been configured in the ORGANIZATION7 presenter.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So, sorry, your microphone is.",
            "Ok, ok. Just a minute, just a minute. I think that the corret correct fingerprint have already been configured in the ORGANIZATION7 presenter.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, but I also need to to call them from my AB client and.",
            "Ok, ok, ok.",
            "I, it's a personal issue, not not a screen issue. I can't find the web, from admin web I st I I can not search the path from English.",
            "Oh, really?",
            "It does, I keep refreshing, may maybe I'm doing something wrong.",
            "Admin web two?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok.",
            "No results.",
            "Search path. Ok.",
            "I I know which publisher we are using because there is just one for the Romanian. Who's going to output to that? So the. Which translator is going to produce Romanian?",
            "PERSON1. From the audio to the text. There is a path, let's check for if there's the the translation f in English. Search.",
            "Or it's.",
            "To English. Maybe it's just the search path that is not working. Try to test it to AB client.",
            "Just a raw.",
            "Yep.",
            "C'mon, c'mon.",
            "Ok, ok. Is it listed here the the Romanian machine translation in the spreadsheet? I can't see it but maybe it's just early morning also for me. It works. No.",
            "I get no connection I mean there is no path to Romanian.",
            "Ok, PERSON11, may I ask you to share with us input and output fingerprint of the Romanian machine translation? PERSON11, PERSON11, pardon. PERSON11? Is the Romanian machine translation up and running?",
            "I just test it for a few minutes and I stopped it now.",
            "Ok, leave it up and running because also you would like to test it.",
            "Yeah we need, we need worker to be online otherwise. Well, I mean, in principle we can I don't know test the the German again to show because I'm going to disappear in a minute so.",
            "Yes, PERSON10 don't worry at all. PERSON11, can you start the machine translation of Romanian again, please? So that we can make test. Ok.",
            "You mean with ASR, right?",
            "We would like to.",
            "Both the a, the ASR and a translator.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Well, actually the pipe is from German audio obtain German text translate in English text and then from English to Romanian. Ok.",
            "So you just want English and Romanian and German, nothing else. Or do you want like others languages.",
            "We would like to test the pipe that starts from German audio and up to Romanian text.",
            "Ok, ok, I run it.",
            "And please share with us the machine translation fingerprint of Romanian so that we can check a work pipe.",
            "Have a worker which can do direct translation from German into Romanian.",
            "Yes, we know. The English pivots.",
            "Ok.",
            "What we are using the English pivot no I'm using for this worker which translates from the German to Romanian.",
            "Ok, cool. Yeah I thought you were doing pivoting.",
            "Pivoting. Oh ok.",
            "I I could.",
            "Don't worry.",
            "Never mind, I may misunderstood.",
            "Yes.",
            "But I think first worker doesn't offer English translation, right?",
            "Sorry guys, I I.",
            "Ok ok.",
            "Yeah, the script is set up, there are two sets of the fingerprints, PERSON2 you can choose.",
            "One.",
            "Let me check that my editor is closed. So ok. Bye everyone, sorry. I'll be back when I can.",
            "Bye PERSON10. Ok. PERSON11. Please write in the chat the fingerprint of the machine translation we would like to use for the demo.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "PERSON12 by the way, does your regular worker provides translation to English, does it?",
            "The German?",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Translator. I think possibly the worker doesn't currently but it's easy to change. So ok, so which languages would you like? Basically everything we have now plus English, or?",
            "Yeah, that would be great. Because I I had an English worker running until yesterday and I don't know why why it is stop and it's difficult to get.",
            "Ok.",
            "GPU for for it now, but let me still check.",
            "Ok and English to the next and restart worker?",
            "Meanwhile, may I ask you to write me the fingerprint of the machine translation work.",
            "Yeah, I I sorry. I I I did but I forgot to remind you. It's in the ORGANIZATION6 document itself.",
            "Ok. Ok.",
            "Ok, so shall I.",
            "Yes, thank you.",
            "Ok, ok. So here.",
            "Ok, ASR.",
            "VEE from EAN to DEEU from EAN pub. And.",
            "And.",
            "Romanian from.",
            "Ok, ok. Ro EN. I think that, are are you able to run this kind of pipe and putting input German ASR, German audio and obtain Romanian text.",
            "Yeah I do but like it it need some quite ugly hacking like hard-cording the fingerprints sometimes.",
            "In fact I suppose that there is no direct path between this two. Let me check again.",
            "So I quickly start the worker for English first to that I should also see English. And then it will start the pipeline very quickly.",
            "Ok, this path exists. Ok there is no way to arrange our demo with the actual fingerprints map. Because there is no direct path with German and Romanian. It works in the plan B because actually pipe text on on the client site. Which is definitely not the way to use the the service architecture. But actually it works so. Will not comment it, it works. But we can not do it on our site with plan. Until you prepare the ORGANIZATION1 server and your pipe in the ORGANIZATION1 server so that you will have your mega pipe, piping text into many clients. And we give you the the part of the script which actually place simultaneously video and audio. Since PERSON5 is going to arrive in 9 minutes, first to test together the plan B.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, and we will reason about plan C later, ok.",
            "Ok, ok, ok.",
            "Meanwhile I'm going to start the correct fingerprint path, maybe we can arrange it today. We use the same, audio to text. Did you confirm me that the machine translation worker for Romanian it's not up and running?",
            "Yeah, it's not, I'm on time to get the English worker up so that I can also see that English subtitle.",
            "Ok. Just I was not see it connected to the to the mediator.",
            "English worker behaves really let's start without the English. Ok, so I play the video from Youtube itself, ok?",
            "Ok.",
            "So, how do you want it distribute.",
            "Well, I would like to see the demo set up. So that you are going to share your screen.",
            "Ok.",
            "Online text flow in the upper side of the screen. The text of presentation platform in the lower side. We will see the countdown. And when the countdown says to play start we will play start on upper shared video. This is the plan B demo.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "My system's overloaded from ORGANIZATION4 and.",
            "When the worker is up and running please give me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok. So so that I can definitely check the the existing pipe.",
            "I need to relieve the window. Hard. So here is the video and I'm just want to have them. Where is this thing.",
            "Hi PERSON5.",
            "Hi, hi PERSON12, nice to see you again.",
            "Yeah, you too.",
            "Hi, good morning.",
            "Hi good morning.",
            "Good morning.",
            "Hi.",
            "So let's let's start it.",
            "So let me ask PERSON2 in the meantime. What is what is the status now. Because I've I wasn't here for the most of the our preparations.",
            "Ok, we checked the actual existing fingerprints. And plan B cannot be displayed at the moment. Plan C, sorry. The reason is that at the moment doesn't exist a direct pipe starting from German to Romanian. So that we will need to all have our direct pipe so that we will be able to run it. Or having ORGANIZATION1's server and sharing with ORGANIZATION1 actually it's already the Github repo repo. We will share it again. Share with ORGANIZATION1 the the methodology in order to both stream audio and stream video. So that you can run your mega pipe in your web server. And this is what actually I prefer as option because it's important to let you be able to replicate this kind of demo. But we will work on it don't worry.",
            "So that's plan B. So plan C cannot be tested now and plan B.",
            "No, just now.",
            "And plan.",
            "Since focusing on the Romanian translation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON11 is preparing the plan B demo. And it he's arranging his screen so that we will be able to see both the presentation platform and online text flow.",
            "So this is PERSON11's screen, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok. And so that we will proceed with the Romanian understandibility. Test.",
            "Yeah. So for PERSON5, she can watch this screen. And we will see whether this is smooth enough or not. And if it's not, then or if the font size is too small then PERSON5 can also decide to look at the links. So for example the lower part the lower window, which now PERSON11 has increased in size. This quest thousand text flow. This is something that PERSON5 could open on her own web browser. To have better resolution, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, but I would like to test the final demo.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Situation also.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so the final demo situation is that PERSON5 should only be looking at this shared screen by PERSON11.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, that's fine with me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON11 you have to open also the presentation platform output.",
            "I.",
            "And I see another technical problem. Will we hear the sound from the video? Because the play back has to go not only to PERSON11's headphones but also to the ORGANIZATION4 call.",
            "You need to open this link and follow the instructions what you see in the in the presenter.",
            "Ok, so that is the most important part.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Plan B is the one which involves the count down appearing. That each remote participant will be able to play all at the same time.",
            "Ok. So if those who do not need to listen to the German sound can only watch and those who would like to listen as well they need to open the video and play it at the same time as the the video is started on PERSON11 screen right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So PERSON5 can safely stay with this view and I will try.",
            "Yeah yeah, definitely.",
            "When to try the the demo output. Which is ok this one. I think that we are going to increase the views of this video on Youtube. Exponentially.",
            "Yeah yeah, that's quite possible.",
            "So let me know let me know when everyone is ready and I can start then.",
            "I see one strange thing. And that is in the PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION7 com platform. The subtitling there is the video included but it is only the last 9 seconds.",
            "It's for the plan C demo. Since we are able also to include the the video in the presentation output it was just a test of the paste days. We can remove the video for example.",
            "Ok.",
            "PERSON11 would you mind putting the tab with the the subtitles bit further up?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just in case the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "If you refresh the page, the video should disappear.",
            "Ok, ok, great.",
            "Are we going to see also English subtitles, because I'm not that good in Romanian.",
            "I I did plan to use English subtitles but English workers are something's wrong with English worker.",
            "Ok, don't worry at all the German one instead it's going to be used.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah. So will have from.",
            "Ok. I I can try to get something from German.",
            "Ok, so if I'm understand correctly there is no English involve in the German to Romanian translation.",
            "No.",
            "Is the direct model that goes from German into Romanian.",
            "Yeah, yeah. It's PERSON12 PERSON12's model and we're I'm using that right now.",
            "Yeah, I'm I'm actually slowly confused what I was going on with this. Because it looks like the slowing through my English English input system. So it looks like it's going English into Romanian.",
            "Sending German into the English channel. Probably.",
            "Ok, so yes. So I've got 2 workers running, 1 does translation from German into several languages including Romanian. The other one does translation with English into the same well more or less the same languages. And it looks like the data is coming through the English one.",
            "Ok, PERSON11 please check your pipe, ok?",
            "Yeah, my pipe is ready right now and.",
            "Yes, but if I correctly un understood of course. PERSON12 is saying that you are going to use the English into Romanian instead of the German to Romanian.",
            "Did I understood correctly?",
            "So what I, ok. So first one right now takes German input and emits packet which has several languages. Right, right PERSON12?",
            "Yes.",
            "PERSON12 has 2 models.",
            "Yes, so one has like multiple languages and one has only a sub set up of languages, if.",
            "They differ in the source language.",
            "Yes, definitely, so I'm using the one which has German as a source language.",
            "PERSON12 sees it the other way round.",
            "Ok.",
            "Let's test it. Let's test it and if the Romanian is very bad.",
            "A raw test. If it doesn't make sense.",
            "Ok, so we know any further let's let's start, ok? So, PERSON5 should just look at my screen and PERSON6 maybe perhaps try to get this on on video. Ok. So ok, so I'll start right now.",
            "Ok. Wow also the countdown is translated. Super cool.",
            "Ok, so that was the complete.",
            "Yeah so this is this is autoplay.",
            "So one moment before anyone next any comment I'd like to speak to PERSON6 that the. So when I emit these instruction the count down, it comes faster in ORGANIZATION7 presenter and rather slow in request. So by the time when the count down reaches 5 or when the count down reaches 0 in ORGANIZATION7 presenter, the countdown is still around like 5 or 4 in the in the in the quest.",
            "Sorry, I couldn't hear that because my Youtube was on autoplay and it's started talking German the next video in addition to that. I've notice that there was a mismatch between I clicked on 0 exactly at the zero, and I was too early. My sound was too early compare to yours.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So what I'm saying is that the countdown is delayed in quest.",
            "Aha.",
            "So by the time the count down is like 5 or 4 in quest, the count down has already reached 0 in in ORGANIZATION7 presenter.",
            "So I was looking at the ORGANIZATION7 presenter and I clicked when the ORGANIZATION7 presenter told me 0. Then the sound was too early compare to what you were show. Or what I was seeing in ORGANIZATION4. Maybe there is another delay in ORGANIZATION4.",
            "No no no, that's not the.",
            "I I took a couple of notes and I also have the the feeding that the the tag platform. Had a little delay, but I think that we have to to.",
            "Technical details return first we should hear PERSON5's.",
            "Yes, exactly. You're muted.",
            "Yeah, so I think the translation was a better than what we saw last time. It was no birds. So I think it was mostly made sense, occasionally maybe at 8 and 13 where this this longer this longer sentences I maybe that that was I cannot like a disappear of the screen because it took some time to generate it and I didn't actually have time to read it.",
            "Long sentence, yeah.",
            "Yeah and I guess the 13 as well it's bit.",
            "Yeah, even, yeah agree that it's pretty long sentence.",
            "Yeah, so I think it's much better than last time cause I I got the point. So it's mostly fluent. From like I have trouble when it's blinking light gray. Then it becomes harder to to keep reading while it's keep generating. So sometimes it feels like I'm loosing track of the of the translation. And ok. So it's not perfect, but I kind of now I can read through it and understand what what it's talking about. But it's also that the like it's talking about I guess it's very bureaucratic so. I guess one other observation I have is that the instruction at the beginning maybe those like if you scroll up when you show the demo. It says \"please make click on the game\". When the the number reaches zero. And so, and 2 I think it I think you on English word that we can use. But the correct word are should be like Romanian subtitler. If you want to show this demo with the first instructions, I think maybe they I can't give you the translation for the the for the instructions.",
            "Aha, ok. Thanks.",
            "Maybe that's word, that's translated as as game. The game that, yeah. But I guess that's translated by the same model as the rest of the talk, so maybe it's a bit auto.",
            "Maybe we say to keep this in English. And try to not to ruin the instruction through the MT. But I don't know if this is easy or hard.",
            "So like ok, ok. So so will discuss this later on.",
            "Ok.",
            "So we try another video that I haven't listened to before?",
            "That's yeah, that's a good idea. And we could try the other one that PERSON4 recommender, right? The TED talk.",
            "Yeah, I have a list of talks here.",
            "Maybe ask you, PERSON11, to make the presentation platform output being wide as the wall screen.",
            "Yes, that is important for the logo size.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You mean maximizing the this our presenter or ORGANIZATION7 presenter?",
            "No, no, ORGANIZATION7.",
            "Because because actually the ORGANIZATION4 box, video boxes cover most of the output. And I also note that your your computer has efficient resolution in order to avoid the problem.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "This could be also as manu improvement.",
            "So let me open this German TED talks.",
            "So I'm afraid I'll have to disconnect earlier because I haven't finish my works. But I've recorded the assessment by PERSON5 into our ORGANIZATION6 doc, I don't know if you see it. But PERSON5 is maybe not looking at the document but if you could, maybe PERSON2, if you could do the same for the next video.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Yeah. And PERSON5, thanks a lot for for this test. The one think that I wanted to ask everybody to do what's to agree on the next slot for our team. And I don't know whether we should again ask you PERSON5 for the assessment I don't think it is that necessary. But our team should definitely meet again soon, so please figure out slot and put it to the to the ORGANIZATION6 doc. Yeah, ok, so thanks a lot and I'm I'm disconnecting at the moment, and I keep my all my fingers crossed for for the next video as well. Yeah, thanks, bye bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Ok, so yeah yeah. So you want me to maximize the like this.",
            "Maximize on wide, not of course because we still have to see both the outputs. Thank you.",
            "So I just have a little space here to click the video.",
            "Don't worry, don't worry.",
            "So, ok, so this video is like 14 minutes long. And so, when will you want to like this pause it it's going, it's enough. Just like say it in the mike.",
            "Maybe like 3 minutes or so if if they start.",
            "Ok, so I'll myself pause the video, then. Ok, so. Start. Aha I have some error here.",
            "Meanwhile, may I ask you a question PERSON11?",
            "Yeah, yeah, please.",
            "The Romanian machine translation is the RB.",
            "So, yeah, so so.",
            "The Romanian machine translation is RB minus EU under score from DE minus. Is it correct?",
            "So ok, you mean the subtitler, the publishing sub.",
            "No, I mean the machine translation worker. Because I still need to check the the pipe. So I'm looking for worker to be used for translation. Is the RB minus, ok cool, super cool.",
            "So here, ok.",
            "This one. I I was searching for R and instead it's R, ok. This explain everything. Thank you.",
            "Yeah. Something something is wrong with this. I don't know why. Just just.",
            "We have it.",
            "I'm sorry about this.",
            "Don't worry.",
            "Oh, sorry. Ok, so let's start it. Ok, so PERSON2 I was start in the in in 2 seconds.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I I.",
            "Ok, we are ready for the next.",
            "Yeah, so basically I I do not how but my directory, I jump into some other directory and I was wondering why do I see this weird thing. Ok.",
            "No worry.",
            "Yeah, so let's start.",
            "So do you want it to continue, or it should be enough.",
            "Yeah, I think we can stop.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Ok, and I'm also ready to hear your feedback PERSON5.",
            "I think, if I'm right, I don't know. This might be about the talk might be about how to determine which people will be founders of companies and their trades and personalities and science about that, maybe? So, I find it harder to read then the previous one. And some of the sentences kind of have some non-sensical stuff. Like this like morphologically wrong stuff, like not agreeing in like numbers. Yeah, so I would say I would have hard time like following what they're trying to say other than something about personalities and trades and how to make some science out of predicting I don't know who will be, I don't know. And there is, yeah. Maybe if you can scroll up, might be, like. And at the beginning it says about. Ok. So like says, like number 2 like how founders as and I read it like founders of company or something were born. So I don't know what this about exactly, but there is, like if that's the topic of the of the talk. I kind of misses the point I think. So it's like using the word born in like baby being born maybe. Then.",
            "Sorry PERSON5. Do you think that the speaker miss the the point of the talk or it's the translation which has probably a lack of.",
            "Yeah, mean the translation. Yeah, I'm I'm like starting to lis to read through the the lines and I'm trying to pick up the topic and like from the line number 2 there it seems to be about I'm starting to it's talking about founders being born. So I don't know. So just reading that and trying to guess what it's about it's hard to tell. And then anyway goes on about something. So I think it's it's a bit tricky to to follow. Maybe later on you get more like number 18 is like like if you look at the number 18 that sentence is very nonsensical. It says like, can you imagine a character with big borders. Men, marked bath with hair. And gray and long, so it's like a very nonsensical. There is also some like.",
            "The audio? Also.",
            "No, I did not listen to the audio.",
            "Maybe, you know it's detail talk, it's some kind an an informal talk. So maybe in the meanwhile the speaker were making a kind of example which makes sense only looking at him. Describing.",
            "Yeah. But if, yeah, but the words the actual words just don't should not be they.",
            "Ok.",
            "Even like I get it, that I guess he's describing some person but some of the words should not be there. Like together. And like before it 17 I think I don't know if it is the name of a person. PERSON3 is translated in Romanian for the actual word, so it's mean so the name identity I think it's translated. It 17.",
            "The name of the person is PERSON3.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON3 is being translated. As the actual Romanian word for bored.",
            "Yeah, I got it. I don't know if the.",
            "Ok, and at 18 that PERSON3 think that's what confuse me. It's translated again and then it says something like large borders, because PERSON3. Yeah, so that's that's why it it yeah.",
            "I don't know if it could be. If it works like in the machine translation ORGANIZATION7 works. But I think that probably we can add some kind some set of words which should not be translated. PERSON12?",
            "Is it possible to add a list of words not to be translated?",
            "No, no, it's not easy to do. For the current model. I know people have.",
            "Domain adaptation kind of.",
            "Yeah. So the last I checked it wasn't easy to do. Is possible I mean, is possible within the last few months I should check.",
            "Because maybe we we are the finding the files we're going to demo. Maybe we can add some minor tuning here in the in order to fix also the translation. Ok, did did you get PERSON5's point? She.",
            "Yeah, yeah I caught that.",
            "Yeah, so like here more nonsensical stuff other sentences were fluent but again hard to follow to the person, like what point the person was trying to make.",
            "Ok.",
            "And this was translated by TED talk model or by the europei model? I'm just wondering.",
            "It it's actually train on lots of data from so that's a real mixture of stuff in there. So, yeah, is there somewhere but that should be some TED talks subtitles. I think the Bible is there. Yeah there's a real real mixture.",
            "Ok, I would say a bit worse then the previous one.",
            "Ok. I wrote your feedbacking the in the minutes. And. Are you available this week to schedule new test maybe?",
            "Yeah, I'm available. What I was thinking was whether you would like to one of few of these videos and get the transcript and then send me offline a bunch of this video and then maybe I could say which of them was harder to follow, which was easier to follow just to get an idea of. If if you think that would help. Like and if you want from like french to Romanian if you want to have a other options.",
            "In the meantime I also English subtitles ready so if you have if you wish I can play another 30 seconds.",
            "With English subtitles?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'm I have more time.",
            "Which video?",
            "It will definitely be.",
            "The first one or the second one?",
            "Which one do you want?",
            "It's the same, pick one.",
            "So, I can just play the the next TED talk.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok then.",
            "May I ask you to copy and paste the link in the chat box?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where is the chat box. Ok, so. I paste.",
            "It's in the bottom.",
            "Yes, this is how my screen looks like so.",
            "Ok. Yeah I prepare the new point. In the today test session.",
            "Ok. So, ok. So I'll quickly paste the video.",
            "Ok, scroll down. Exactly. Scroll, scroll.",
            "Down, ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, so here.",
            "Ok, ok. I make order now.",
            "Yeah. This is this quest. Sorry, sorry guys. There is something wrong with the English worker. Just just a moment. Sorry guys English subtitler running. There is something wrong with with my script. Ok, we can try this English subtitler along with English.",
            "Ok, do you want to still let this one play little bit?",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "The Romanian?",
            "Ok, so I I'll start it again.",
            "Or or we can do like I said you can like send me the scripts, the transcripts and I can play through some of the videos if that.",
            "So it transcripts which are being generated here, right?",
            "Yeah, like if you want to pick like 5 videos of different types and run it through your software and then send me the links to the youtube videos and and files with the transcripts you generated then I could also like later this week just go through them and see which one I think is.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Is ready to follow.",
            "I can do that, yeah.",
            "Yeah, I mean 5 10 you can send me a few I I have time.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So we can have just a dip more. Like some of those Europei type and some of these TED talks and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can pick up what. But, yeah, I think it's it's definitely really great to see everything put together, so. Little bit more work, but I think it's impressive.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok.",
            "Should I give you, are you, should I give you any more feedback, or some more specific stuff?",
            "Well, on my side, is all. PERSON12 do you have question regarding the trans additional quest regarding the translation maybe? Or not.",
            "Just to, maybe PERSON5 you impression compared with the last session. Or the translation.",
            "Yeah, so. Last session I only heard the that you that one about healthcare or.",
            "Ok.",
            "So that was much better this time to follow. Like that previous time I don't know what was wrong with the model but it just it just when it translate somethings bad and I guess that personal spoke a lot. So yeah, the first video that we showed was much better this time.",
            "Ok, so yeah, it was a different underlaying translation model which was trained on less data. And was trained for more languages. So it definitely make sense that this this new model should perform better. So it's good that you.",
            "Yeah, that's good. And I mean I did listen to that after we had a meeting I did go and listen through the video and look that like the ORGANIZATION6 subtitles so I had a better understanding of what that video was about. I I realized that what you're doing is live translation ORGANIZATION6 does offline translation. And the thing that throws me off is it's when there is some way that are totally out of they don't fit. Then it throws me off when I'm trying to follow the the subtitles live. So because I don't have time to go over and pause and think. That's why it's sometimes hard to to follow like in the TED talks. But, yeah. Yeah, for the TED TED talks sometime I think it was a bit disfluent. As well.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, well. I I I just want to say I remember when I like back in my PhD when I tried to do speech translation with my syntax system and it was, it was not even one percent as good as this one. So I'm I'm just having a lot of fun just so you know the demo I'm really impressed. So it's pretty awesome. Yeah, ok, well, let me know if you want to have another meeting, I'm pretty open this week.",
            "Ok, thank you so much.",
            "Thank you PERSON5.",
            "Another meeting, because your feedback is really really appreciated.",
            "Ok, great. Well, thank you guys.",
            "For the moment, you're free. Bye.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Bye, bye, bye PERSON5.",
            "Ok. The other guys, please wait a minute.",
            "Yea, yeah, we will stay here.",
            "To test the Romanian translation. Give me one second.",
            "So I got that English subtitler ready, let me check if it works.",
            "May I ask you your output fingerprint? Of the client the audio into the ASR?",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely. So I display it here. And it's this one.",
            "Ok, is the one are you.",
            "Yea, yeah, yeah.",
            "But sometimes I didn't get output from. But not this one is the publisher. The ASR.",
            "So, this is the ASR.",
            "Ok, it's the one I used to. Sometimes I didn't get output. Ok. I have to go in 15 minutes so go back to the minutes of today. And let's check what is we're missing. It's really really important for us that today you get in touch with this is admin and the find ORGANIZATION1's server for plan C, ok?",
            "Yea, yeah.",
            "Yep. Today it's. We haven't yet tested non-native English speaker, we have to do it in the next session. We haven't made also the the stress test.",
            "Yeah. We can do this stress test now, but.",
            "I have to leave unfortunately because actually I a meeting. Finish at 11 and I had another meeting.",
            "Aha.",
            "I will I would make order in the minutes and I will send you the. Let's the next test session which could be tomorrow, what do you think?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok. Tomorrow. Ok, I will be available starting from 11 what do you think? Is it fine for you?",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's completely fine.",
            "Ok. If it's possible, tomorrow we can tune the plan C. In your server, ok?",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Ok, and that's all, I will. PERSON12 it's fine also for you? To test again everything at 11 tomorrow?",
            "I may have to drop in meeting, but I will.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Ok, perfect. So see you tomorrow guys. Actually today when pretty pretty good. Plan B is fully working. We haven't yet I think from plan C. Actually it works but. Now you have just my my promise and I we haven't anything. But I hope that tomorrow we can arrange something. If it's possible PERSON11, leave the machine translation worker running. So that we can tune the pipe maybe for tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, sure, sure they'll be running. Yeah.",
            "Ok, perfect. Thank you so much guys. See you tomorrow. I will send you an invitation.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Bye, bye bye.",

            "Hello, can you hear me?",
            "Yep, we can hear you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Aa, excellent, yeah. Sorry, I I was in other call. So yeah. Let me start, thanks for everybody who has already joined this. And let me start with the important reminder that this surge activity is. Planned to like distribute some some bonuses among you as as you may. Remember from January. And for that, in order to distribute these these bonuses I need to know who. Has worked on what. Obviously, we have our these these minutes on the from these calls. But still I would like you to maybe walks to the limits through the through. These through these minutes and then list it in the in the table in a. Concise way. So please do that. I'll do that myself as well for all of you. Like I'll I'll double check that I will scan my memory and and thinky file. If I have forgotten something or not but please make your like make sure. That nothing is forgotten. And then I'll distribute the points and and we'll see how that's translates to. Money. There will be some issues because the the university afraid of corona virus. Is, has somehow like prohibited bonuses on in general, but I think that we. Should be able to go around this. So things are getting complicated. And then I wanted to thank everybody for the IW SLT submissions, the. Work on that. The systems are now in evaluation. I know that PERSON10 has already provided the outputs in some way and I. Didn't have the time to look at that. But yep, that will that will happen probably after the weekend. And yeah then the other thing is the uni hack. Which is the PROJECT6, that we will, I sh I have not yet announced it. But we should we should announce it it's happening for the public from. Wednesday evening where there is some choice of topics and actually starting. On Friday over the extended weekend if you're going to do various discussions. And there will be closing sessions and we would like to test the the subtitling there. So this is just an advertisement for that if you are curious and for PERSON11. This is actually quite some work to to make sure that the system is is. Running. And I would also like to to hear from PERSON11 just a confirmation that he. Will try again the subtitling or transcript for the Wednesday meeting of the. LOCATION1 department.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Yeah, definitely I'll try to sleep in early so that I can.",
            "There, there is thing which is called alarm clock.",
            "Yeah, I'll definitely put alarm clock. It's quite useful when you sleep at like 6 am in the morning.",
            "Oh yes, definitely. Yeah, that's that's not going to work. Okay, yeah. So so that is that is probably everything from me. I've worked on, well, the IW SLT submissions and then the the lectures. Actually. So for some reason the lectures remote lecturing is getting more and more. Exhausting. And that's why I I don't remember if I did anything specific. Yeah. So that's that's from me. So now from all of you, what what have you done? If we can hear PERSON10, then we can start with PERSON10. If this works. Doesn't seem so. Okay, so I'll I'll read for PERSON10 so he has all the EAF files. Yeah, does it work. Ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So all the EAF files are done, right? They are in line with the OST files now, correct?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok that's excellent. Thank you. And then, yes, you have created the ASR evaluation and you have evaluated s. Yeah, okay, so you have so far evaluated only 1 system, right? The ORGANIZATION6 submission by PERSON7.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So it will be good if you could do all the others and actually this is. Something that I told to to PERSON1. The idea is that within each of the submission directories there is this. Subdirectory \"as received\" but outside of this as received we can reformat the. Outputs in in any way which is convenient for us. So please propose unified far format like file naming convention, rename the. Files as needed. So that every submitter has multiple systems and then with each of these. Multiple systems we have all the many files. And if this layout will be identical across all the submitters, then you. Will need just one script. And that's the point. So I think it's it's probably better to do like manual shuffling of the. Files of the received submissions into this common format and then to have 1. Evaluation script for that format. Then to create separate scripts which would process the original layout.",
            "Mmm-mm.",
            "Do you do you understand?",
            "Aaa yeah.",
            "Yeah. And also when doing these this like re whatever, reshuffling or this this. Layout adjustment, please commit these adjusted files as well. In many cases this will simply mean that the files are named differently but. They have identical contents. And Git is so clever that if it the file is identical it will not use any. Any new space anyway. So make copies, copies are totally cheap in in Git repositories. So make copies of the of the files and organize them in a way which is. Convenient for you to process all of them at once.",
            "Mmm-mm. Yeah, I do it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I do it.",
            "Yeah, thank you. So that's that is good progress from from your side. Yeah. I don't know if if there's anything that you would need to know or if. I I need to revise the the outputs, the scores from PERSON7, but I would like. To look at this only once I have all the systems to consider. So because the the numbers will like. I can understand that numbers only in relation with other numbers. So please t like put now the priority to this. And evaluate all the systems on all the files.",
            "But PERSON15 if you we can share ORGANIZATION7 docs for problems in submission. Files and the owners of them can explain or correct them.",
            "Okay, so what are the problems? So what are what are the problems?",
            "For example files are such as.",
            "Say it again, I, yeah it's the the connection is bad.",
            "For example format of files, and convert fi convert files to our format.",
            "Yeah, so I think that in most cases this should be very easy to. Understand. Because you know what the inputs were and you know what the people were. Doing. We know that for example the this guy from LOCATION2, PERSON17, he did not. Have any segmenter at all. So provided just the outputs without segmentation. And this is something that we have to evaluate as as it is. That means that we'll be limited only to the like complete and concatenated. Scoring. So word error rate for the whole document. And blascore for the whole document, and that's it. But I think it's it should be possible for all the submissions to to. Interpret it to to find it. And and yeah. So well, we have this this document on the test set problems where I'm. Listing the problems that I spotted in the reference. Use that document also to list the problems of the submissions. And then notify me so that I will try to resolve that. We should first try ourselves and only if we really only if we really. Struggle, then we should contact the the authors. So I'll create so problems of submissions. Please write them here and I'll, yeah. Yeah, so I'm just assigning that brand new section to you in in the IW. SLT test set problems. So please put it there. Ok. So you will receive Gmail notification.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So I think this is this is good progress. So let's now move to another person, PERSON11, so.",
            "Yes, so, yeah I was mainly busy with IW SLT work with segmenting at PERSON9's. ASR outputs and features of ASR outputs as was PERSON3's. And then apart from that, I think yeah that's all I did and I did not work. Yesterday. And this week I plan to retrain text segmentation using increased voc vocabulary and retrained embeddings.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And again the daily testing of Czech SLT and sensitive value yesterday and also PERSON13 integr. PERSON13's PROJECT1 models will be integrated in embedding testing and again prepare for the coming Unihack.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "These are all, these needs these needs to be done this week.",
            "Yeah, okay. So when retraining the segmentor, it will be really good to to use as. Much data as possible.",
            "As much data as possible, right?",
            "I th yeah, I would suggest as much data as possible. So let's or well be better yet you should if if you really have had time the. Ideal thing would be to like try smaller sizes and larger sizes and see the. Saturation curve. And if the if the accuracy is steady then there is no point in using more. Data, but if if it's still grows then then it's a good to use more.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so earlier this month I I retrained the text segmentor using. A different data set some Czech data that I got from PERSON9. And it was pretty bad.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I I took of, to get enough of short sentences and enough of long. Sentences as well, but that did not have much.",
            "Yeah, so the the critical thing is what is that test set. So did the test set has to be in line what we are using this for. And so so please before retraining let's let's like let's have some plan. What is what is what should be in the test set.",
            "Exactly, because we want we want more segments in our ASR outputs. So I think we sh we need to have a smaller segments smaller sentences in. The training set as well.",
            "Yeah exactly. And good source could be PROJECT7 itself but maybe we can use the version 2. Point. So the 2 point 0 which is more filtered. In some way.",
            "Point zero. I last I had heard about it is 1 point 7, which is a filtered version of 1 point 6.",
            "Yeah and there is 2 point 0 just released for PROJECT4 primary by PERSON8. And it is filtered even further. And it also contains a lot of synthetic parallel tags where one of the sides. Is always like correct Czech. But this is news. So.",
            "Aha, ok.",
            "I would the the synthetic part. But I would focus I would I would check the the subtitles and and other domains. So I would do some statistics collection on the training data. And I would double check that the training data contains segments short. Enough as as exactly as you as you say to make sure that that we are cutting. It frequently enough.",
            "Yeah, exactly so so let's let's first train the current text segmentor. Using retrained embeddings and let's observe the results and then the next phase would be to train it with short segments..",
            "Yeah, okay. That looks that looks good. Great. So who else do we have? We have PERSON4 and PERSON9 and PERSON16 as well. So let, because I know what PERSON4 and PERSON9 have been doing, let me start. With PERSON16. So PERSON16, please summarize.",
            "Hi. I have sent you e-mail Yeah. regarding the instructions.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So I don't know, maybe you didn't get time for that.",
            "Yeah, exactly that's it. I didn't get get the time, but please don't have the the annotators wait. I know again of 1 person who is waiting.",
            "Okay. But I got an e-mail from PERSON6 yes she send me back all the files. And I'll assign another file to her. So I don't. But, okay, I will follow your suggestion. And I. Okay, and last week I as I as mention in my report I worked on on data collection. Especially in ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION1. And now I'm working on rest of 22 in languages. So I have already started and maybe I'll finish tomorrow and then it will be. Uploaded on GitHub.",
            "So, yeah sorry, I, someone is shifting the meeting that I have after this so I I. Was not fully paying attention. You were saying that you have the monolingual data collected for many. Languages, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "And this is the training data. Or this is supposed to be part of the test set.",
            "Monolingual data is for training.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And test sets because we had planning as we discussed in the last meeting. And so we we have to collect 43 lan test for the test data for 43. Languages.",
            "Yes.",
            "So 22 languages are remaining. And 22 non non non ORGANIZATION8 languages.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm collecting rest of the languages.",
            "You're collecting the target side monolingual data. Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, this should not go to the GitHub repository, just to make sure. The training data should not be version in GitHub because it is it should be. Big. It should. If it's not then we have a problem. So it should be inconveniently big for for the GitHub repository.",
            "So okay, how will I s.",
            "So where where do you have where do you have the the data for the. European languages? For ORGANIZATION8 languages.",
            "In the my, European languages data is available in my ORGANIZATION3 system. So.",
            "Yes, exactly. This this, this is the right place.",
            "Yes, ok.",
            "So, these will appear, so please add the path.",
            "Ok, I will put in path in the I guess, SL data assets, SL data asset.",
            "Yeah. And for the test sets. So so the the monolingual data, the monolingual data can be source of. Inspiration. But it was be a lot of labour to to improve it to make it parallel as we. Need the test sets. So for the test sets, the test set should be selected from the parallel data. That the people can find.",
            "Yeah, so I got some links from the by the annotators, like for Serbian, other. Languages. So it is already started for.",
            "Yeah, so it should be quick. How how far is that?",
            "Some places it is not very good, because maybe because of the PDF file. And the URL is not compactable. So but I have to manually check it is working or not. So, I'm not I'm not analyzing anything because. But I will check and analyze and let you know what is that.",
            "Okay, so this is, oh, so you have now separated the annotators into. Individual sheets. I'm looking at the ORGANIZATION7 ORGANIZATION7 sheets right, for the annotators.",
            "Yes, because it is very easy for me when I assign and when I recieve. This and maybe in annotator will also mention an annotator can also mention. When he has finished he or she has finish the.",
            "Yeah, okay. If this is convenient for Ma for you, then yeah, why not. So why are there. So far, okay. So the PERSON6, she has provided 2 files so she's now working on the second. File, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "And that's, so so we have now as far as I understand only 2 files. Finished. 1 by PERSON21 and 1 by PERSON6. And 1 more file in in annotation with PERSON6, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "This is too little. We really need to, yeah.",
            "But because we have we finish the 21 ORGANIZATION8 test set but I like I just with. At PERSON19, if I'm not wrong, in pronunciation. So told me she is work she knows only Bul, Russian and Serbian languages.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And so.",
            "So Russian go for Russian. We don't have Russian covered.",
            "Okay, but I.",
            "Russian is not ORGANIZATION8 languages, so.",
            "But we, it is not available on the. I have not collected yet that data so I ha I can't assign. So, as the reason we are not we have not cleaned rest of the files. I don't know where is the, where is.",
            "PERSON19 PERSON19 found that the some of the talks, like. Minister speeches, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So please select something from that and have that like. Select something. Don't don't let her wait.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I know that processing this in the whole would take some more like. Programmers time. But you can also do some quick props, to to give her something. So do these quick props right now, like send her something, it's. You should always have a bad feeling when these people are like sitting and. Not doing anything.",
            "Yeah, I know. Because of me it is very bad. People are waiting and.",
            "So just imagine, it's like 5 people and except for 1, they all are. Waiting in front of your door until you do the task. So that's.",
            "Okay. I will try to figure out how to maybe maybe I will assign new fil assign. File tonight.",
            "Well, not maybe you have to do it.",
            "Yes, sure, sure I will do that.",
            "So to each of them they really. I think that everybody has suggested some links.",
            "I got, yes, so like PERSON6 sent me link so I have already collected. The data and assign the the files to PERSON6. And PERSON21 send me again test set data to PERSON21, but not for the. PERSON19 so, it is my fault, definitely, because I was working on other. Languages. So, yeah. Okay, I will try.",
            "Yeah, I'm now also opening I'm now also opening the document PROJECT3 test. Set collection process. So there is these details. There is it, yeah for example PERSON14, yes, the Norwegian there is the. Speeches. Seems like a great resource are PERSON16 please, so this is this is now waiting. For over a month. The Norwegian. So this is, so I'll just a reminding of this unfinished task. And it's a small task. So PERSON14 has been waiting for the input files for a month. She has provided the link and and she has not received anything to review.",
            "PERSON14 but I think I have not. Okay I will check PERSON14.",
            "So this is the document that you should be also listing. Yeah we also have this PERSON12, yeah. So the Belarusian for example. That's again, there is some document. There was a found translation, this PERSON12. We have the the PERSON19 the Minister of the interviewer. Here we know that it is a great website. But don't process it fully automatically for now give her something.",
            "Okay.",
            "So to test set this is growing way too slow. And and yeah. So that you, this this PERSON12 for the Belarusian, PERSON12. PERSON12, this is, he is not even in your list. Right?",
            "Actually, I prepared my list because,, email so.",
            "Well, you should be reading this this document, this is the document. Where we invited people to to write about the languages.",
            "Okay. This one, okay. PERSON14.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you. So that's please, really.",
            "Sure, I will follow up your suggestion.",
            "Yeah, the table that you have, the table that you have is is like too. Ambitious for each of the persons, because it lists if I would share the. Screen this is like it's empty sheets and you are planning to have like 24. Or how many lines you see on 1 page shipments with 1 person. So it it's look, it looks very deserted, it is deserted actually. And that's not what you wanted. So it's, yeah. Feel free to to work with this layout but make sure to populate it, to send. The people the files and collect URLs from them.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So that was that was PERSON16. And yep, status of languages for the test set. That's the the other document. This is here. And I would, I don't know we we don't have PERSON13 right, do we?",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, so maybe, maybe PERSON11 can also help with this. So the monolingual data. As soon as PERSON13's models arrive. As soon as you can use them PERSON11. Either either you or PERSON13 should should get the monolingual data from PERSON16. And do the back translation. So translate from the monolingual data from Serbian or from from the. Auditing documents in in Sloven. Go into English. And from English into all the target languages. Please add the path. So here I will say then PERSON16, PERSON16 please add the path and pass this note to. PERSON11 or PERSON13 to.",
            "Take these monolingual data from PERSON16, right?",
            "Say it again, sorry? What was the question?",
            "All these monolingual data from from PERSON16?",
            "Yes yes, I will send path when you will.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah and so the the idea is that the layout we need to discuss this then. Probably either eith either PERSON11 or or PERSON13, we need to figure out the layout. Of the data. It's it is fairly simple it would mean no rocket science just like plain. Text files. They have to already be sentence segmented. And then sentence wise we need to translate them. This translation should be as much parallel as possible because it is a lot. Of files. Or should be lot of files. This would give us the synthetic parallel data. And these should serve in training of the of the models.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "And we have discussed previously with PERSON16 that it's we will go from. English into all the target languages.",
            "Languages.",
            "So that means that the back translation should go from all the many. Monolingual languages into English. And also we.",
            "And then 42. Sorry for interruption.",
            "So, yeah. And then and then we also need to go into English and there we focus on the. ASR languages.",
            "Sorry, I didn't get this point. So I think you want.",
            "Yeah, so the.",
            "From 42 languages to.",
            "So let's start with the let's start with the the hard part. That's all, from each of these 43 languages into English. This is the large portion so let's start with that.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So so the goal the goal is to have a large sit parallel corpus English. Synthetic target mono in 43 languages genuine. Yeah.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah, okay, great. So so now we still have 10 minutes and not more for and actually we should. Have stop already for PERSON4 and PERSON9. So quick updates from you. Especially things that are important for others on the on the PROJECT3 team. So is there anything?",
            "So I think today PERSON9 has updated the model and.",
            "Yes, so so I've updated the ASR model so now it's a much more lightweight. And the loading time should be much faster. But yeah, so I am still waiting for some if we can get hands on some. Adaptation text or some materials and. Yeah, I I can run the adaptation. If if we if PERSON18 PERSON18 provide some texts if I understood it. Correctly, that he is trying to get something -",
            "Double check with him. Double check with him and PERSON5 is the coordinating person. So so that's talk to talk to PERSON5. And also there is a meeting that will mention some of the organization. Details the prg.ai meeting tomorrow at 4. I won't be there because I'll be I'll be teaching. But if you wanted to join to learn some of the details then PERSON5 will will. Be joining. PERSON5 knows the URL. So so he.",
            "I have. I'll forward it to PERSON9.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So there n is like no no need to to take part but it could further, it could. Provide you a further ideas where to get relevant texts.",
            "Mmm-mm.",
            "Do not await but rather actively check if PERSON18 is collecting some. Texts. Okay, good. Yeah, that's great. I'm I'm happy about the the ASR model faster loading time. One thing that'll be good if if anyone could do. Just to use Netcat mainly PERSON11 but anybody can use Netcat to probe. Whether a port is busy or not.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely.",
            "So so that before you launch anything. Before before the lo the whole loading of the ASR model starts on on sole machines, Double check that the selected ports is is free. And and die if it's not.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely, thank you, thank you for the submisison.",
            "Yeah. So I put here and, PERSON11 or add PERSON9 test the port with NC before. Loading ASR, right. Ok, great.",
            "Yeah, just apart from that I've started working on the PROJECT2. Paper which is due in like 10 days. And yeah, I I'm try to do some work with PERSON2 for like testing some things. About summarisation but I it's not probably relevant for others so.",
            "So the the meetings that PERSON2 has they are again, or could serve as nice. Test sets. Or even domain adaptation data. Because this is corrected transcripts. And there is English and Czech meetings.",
            "Mmm-mm.",
            "So getting in touch with PERSON2. Meeting recordings have revised transcripts so they could serve for. Evaluation or adaptation. Okay, great. Okay, and the last person is PERSON4, right?",
            "Yes. And I've been working on the IW SLT, the paper and the evaluation of my. Model so I I didn't do anything apart this. And I I work on my thesis. In the meantime.",
            "Yeah, that good, that that's important work in any case. I was curious about the onlinesation. Which is something which is. So like you should not be distracted too much by work for PROJECT3 you should. Really focus on on the thesis. But how far are we from use usable integration of your models into the. Pipeline and what are the blockers. This is what I would like to to hear.",
            "Yes. I provided some version of online model of mine, but it was rather naive. Approach where I derived from the probabilities outputted by the by the acoustic. Model. Pro I derived where the probable splits between the words are and I just used. The most probable one in window of 8 seconds. And split it there. So I guess it would be nice to to train the transformer model that comes. After the acoustic model. So so that.",
            "Sorry, an interruption from the family, sorry. They they the simply under unable to understand that I'm at work.",
            "Okay. And and to train the transformer to to give a hints when where are the. Sentences boundaries. Boundaries on the sentences. That that would be nice. But and I I didn't really try to to train the transformer that way. But I can imagine that with some some simple trick with the training data. Like using only parts of the like. Concatenate several sentences together from the training data. And to train the transformer to work on on windows, on continuous windows. Fr on the training data. And to. When train the transformer to to predict the.",
            "The boundaries.",
            "The boundaries, yes.",
            "PERSON3 PERSON3 has experiments on this. So PERSON3 is on vacation, like he he work too hard on the IW SLT. Submission he said that he will take a week of. So that's why he's not here today. But he has done some experiments on this translation of windows already.",
            "Ok, so.",
            "So make sure to talk to him. He has the results. I think it way maybe even discussed here below the, in this document. So maybe you ca if you scan this document there could be links to that. Or ask him and when when he's back in like after the weekend then he will. Prob surely provide you with the pointers.",
            "Okay, so I think it's just about the training of the transformer model.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then it will be be much better.",
            "Yeah, so the he compared it with segment level translation and then there. Was some loss. So in the case where you have the segmentation it's better to use it. But there was no comparison with the set up where you don't have the. Segmentation. So in that case.",
            "And and he he just used some some clever shuffling of training data or. Or he does something more more advanced. Like if you remember we were discussing continuous spoken language. Translation.",
            "That was the goal. So he it was like a running window over the the same document. It was not shuffled data. It was like document windows from a document.",
            "Windows from a document, yes. So that that was my question. Yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So, please get in touch with him to this is. Starting to consider window based translation should get in touch with. PERSON3 who already work on this, on this and has some results. Okay. Great. Amazing. We are not going to be cut by the automat. By the by the machine. This time, right. So thanks to all for your participation. And. Yeah, and see you talk to you next week. Right? But in the mean time there will be the Unihack, the PROJECT6. So there'll be lot of work for for PERSON11 at least. And. Yeah. Ok. Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thanks, bye bye.",
            "PERSON15, are you here?",
            "Yeah I'm still here but it will, we have just 1 minute indeed. 60 seconds.",
            "Yeah, 60 seconds are this much. Can anyone guide me to the path from the Czech into. In the meantime like in my usual time I would work on get it ready for Czech. Segmenter?",
            "To path on the PROJECT7. Net data PROJECT7 2 0. And that should be it. So slash net, slash data slash lower case PROJECT7 2 0 slash.",
            "Okay okay that's enough. Thank you, thanks a lot.",
            "Okay yeah thanks. Bye bye.",
            "Bye."

            "No, together.",
            "Sorry, when?",
            "Tonight.",
            "Tonight. Yeah. So so you now have the emails from me and PERSON2 will explain all the details. In essence, we were offered to, by Microsoft, they were run manual evaluation of primary submissions of and I would like to add also human outputs, so no just the references, because the references are too with a sort segments. Aa, this evaluation will not be specific for ASR so it will be directly. The ASR is not a part of the evaluation, and therefore the segmentation is important. So. So please have a look at the emails and i think you maybe already have a, a have looked. Have look at them. So. Please, let me know, if anything is not clear and i hope that its like its not too complicated that, and that PERSON4 will explain everything tonight. So. Yeah, This is just like or an explanation of the emails from me.",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Ok. Thank you. So a, we have PERSON4 here. We have PERSON5, and nobody else. Then thats strange. So maybe they all the students are learning for various exams. And the search has ended, like in in in in some way, the search is over because thee we. Were doing the preparation for the congress which got canceled, but I still like this to to keep this date. So the the team synchronizes. So its not not so many external people here anymore, bunch at least it's us. So. One thing that I still had not written to you. Is that indeed distributed some money to you based on the search point stable. So in your pace that you will receive during June. There will be some extra bonuses for the works that you have done on the search. So that's i managed you to finish the plan as it was planned and hopefully you will really noticed some little bit bonuses for your efforts. So thanks and now lets quickly go over the updates. So i was very busy with interviewing people who join PROJECT1 and other projects. And then I left the demo supervision to. All the partners are struggling through the get all the systems running in the new date. New date is being selected now. So there will be some efforts in the coming days, not many days for, before the, the demo, because the demo will happen in a week, or possibly two weeks from now, depending on a day chosen. And, we are obviously working, everybody working on deliverables, and i just talk about the evaluation. That will happen manually in addition to the automatic one, which is part of the paper. So that's from me. PERSON5 are you here?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I sent you an email and i forgot what was the topic the project thing. Have you responded or not?",
            "Yes, I have.",

            "So I am downloading there are already know transcriptions and translations and and I am having some progress and i think that in one week we could have some talks in four weeks we could have corpus. And right now I am learning to use and it seems working very well.",
            "Okay.",
            "I cant the speaker maybe we need to go through the manually and aline them with text.",
            "Yeah, that's great does the diarization work also online? Is there any chance to run it online, or is it only offline.",
            "I think it's only offline.",

            "And i see this is all the.",
            "Yes.",
            "So also allow to show such annotation of the sound right.",
            "Yes. It have here labels and i can rewrite them from home.",
            "Okay. So PERSON7 if you also see this screen, this is something which also could be valuable for various of the PROJECT1.",
            "And here need allow to upload the labels and save them in text also textfile. So, this is all.",
            "Ok. Great. Thank you. So then the last person on the call is. And Sanged has been working on the various. So PERSON5 if you. Yeah. Great. Yeah, so Sanged please present and I'll mute myself because I am in the same room.",
            "Yes, so I am actually outside. So basically i on german transcripts and here is the google document. So i think all the adapted is our worker which is slightly better than those the existing. I was also busy with session with yesterday i for the first time and i could before lose the game. And I have requested PERSON7 to run windows.",
            "Okay. So bless scores a pending.",
            "As a PR.",
            "PERSON7 should provide them, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "But PERSON1 -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I would like to evaluate these not a.",
            "Yes Sacre bleu not ELTK, forget ELTK cable, lets not use ELTK.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. When I say, \"Bless course, I mean in general. So, a sacre bleu.",
            "Yeas, so thing.",
            "OK, so. Do we have other files, which also has transcripts? I remember this Czech speeches. We could also do the same for English.",
            "Czech? You mean translations for the Czech videos?",
            "So no. I just leave error rates. So, these two files are the only ones where we have the reference translation. We do not have any reference translation for the a German speech, the the German short video, German long video, neither, so, neither, for. Well, we do have.",
            "We have downloaded the subtitles from youtube and some of them were manually revise and some of them where youtube automatically generated.",
            "But which were manually revised, and they were not translated.",
            "Nono, they were not translated, iam not sure which of them were manually and which of them automatic, but in the directory i have specified using a.",
            "Yeah, so that is evolution for checked you, in German translation. And then evaluation for D, E everything test, no videos, here we could measure word for the constants because we have a transcript, right? And, also for the, also fix them the short German one deep flag,",
            "Reformed.",
            "And we do not have any translations for this, right? And, actually the Czech to German, this cannot work. Or this. This is Czech, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "But then for the Czech into the others we don't have the reference.",
            "No, we don't have unluckily.",
            "Yes, so the bless course cannot be calculated right?",
            "Yeah, calculated.",
            "Yeah. So what we can do is evaluation for English into Czech and German translation.",
            "And PERSON5 also propose that if we number of documents assessing the worker based on blue scores we should do it carefully.",
            "Yes, exactly so obviously these numbers are not reliable. Am not saying that these numbers.",
            "Exactly.",
            "But these numbers I think it would be very good once we select the videos it would be very good to present the videos and tell the people and by the way this was the word of something, something and this was the bless course of something, something. Or maybe we can tell the numbers in advance as well.",
            "So this is like to give people a very rough idea of the correspondence between the quality and the, a, and the score. So. So yes, choosing the. The system is not like based on this. I would actually really like to see the general performance and the, talk level adapted performance.",
            "Yeah. For the. So have you already run the other? Do you have the lock files for this? For the same.",
            "Yeah, we have the but iam not sure if we have the reference translation.",
            "Oh we do, we do. This is. This is the part of the. We do have that. So this is the INASR and then I'll just delete these and i delete these, So this should be there. And bless course.",
            "For English,, for Czech and -",
            "No, no, lets.",
            "Oh its English, this is English okay, okay.",
            "So this is like this part is a probably not going to be presented. Its. I'm not sure if we are going to present it. Because it is a the interpreter is speaking, the interpreter is speaking and not the original speaker. So the original speaker like sits in the video and doesn't talk right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, but this part is the part where we are planning to run it,",
            "Yeah. Here the original speaker speaks himself.",
            "Yeah. And, so, and and we do have the translations for that. So.",
            "Yeah. you mean automatic translations?",
            "Yes, no we have the reference translations.",
            "Okay, I that's why I am confused.",
            "That's the test set. We have them.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So we need you -",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, exactly you are right. I haven't directly, yeah, you're right.",
            "Yeah so, so do you see them now in the directory. Can you look at them, can you look at the references. So, so this is something that PERSON7 should calculate the scores for. And and you should provide the the word.",
            "So just located.",
            "Oh, sorry.",
            "Yes, we have the Czech and German as well, which is the text translations.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so please finish these table i will because if i understand correctly nothing is missing.",
            "Yeah, and the, okay.",
            "And here for the German source videos, we can do it as well. And we have only the channel so there is nothing like adaptation.",
            "And which we do German it was. So yeah, here we have the manually device transcript as well as the youtube transcript as well as the automatic German.",
            "So use the manually revised one.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So after the call we will choose the videos. And I think that. Yeah, we can we can actually try everything in the demo, because it is very easy to start it now since you have all the scripts.",
            "So the that should work reasonably well, except that its Austrian, also in German and not German German. And for Czech we don't have the correct transcript, or do we? Do we have the correct transcript for the short video for the three minute one? I think i did it as well or didn't I?",
            "Let me check which was a they are no task here in the directory.",
            "So by the way, the fille, the Czech Chauffeurs. Sorry, the English Chauffeurs. So the Czech Chauffeurs is like conference call lower quality. So there will be big difference probably between the and Chauffeurs will be much worse. In term of rate.",
            "Okay. So please, please PERSON6, provide the missing numbers.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "-and will decide. And that's it. So. And we have already. So we had PERSON7, we have discussed things during the whole. Now the apart off a SLTF and, yes. And the. As a pre-processing for ember segmenter, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So the segmentation is now more reliable, and you run SLT, why was this? I forgot.",
            "PERSON5 wanted that.",
            "Okay.",
            "For for few days.",
            "For the SLT slides, but actually yes the time is getting short. We have only week to do the recording.",
            "Yes, i can do it. I can start going on Thursday for example.",
            "Yeah. So Sanged, when we run these demos, please make sure that we use Zoom or whatever, and we record it because we do want this recording part of thee. A part of the video by PERSON5 as well.",
            "I in my own from 5 slides with some instructions. So, I am going to do it by them and to the we are going to present slides and video and they will match it. It will be easy for us.",
            "So, PERSON5 physically present here when you do it or so what i think is that we could use the camera, let me use for the seminar.",
            "Yes, we can use a camera.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah, so there is during the semester recordings. It requires a. Option is to present the slides from windows machine and aplication that you click record and records the screen where you have the slides and then they merge it with a video of the speaker.",
            "So what I propose is that i can have the camera PERSON5 physically and any computer screen during the screen recording to get something to capture.",
            "So I think the the videos. We should like not mix the two things. I think one thing is PERSON5 presenting the slides and thats slides Windows machine recording when the slides are shown and PERSON5 talking to them. And recorded on the handy cam that we have and the separate thing is the screen recorded streaming for the demo and that i think the easiest way is to like pass it through Zoom. Or something which can record it or because we need the synchronization there. Can you do a recording of the screen including the sound.",
            "Yes, probably. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, so lets. These two things definitely should not be mixed and i think that in PERSON5 slides there should be a slide and now demo and then PERSON5 will just say now will present the demo, then make a pause and in that pause we or will cut in like the screencast one.",
            "So if iam right PERSON5 will be presenting the slide transcription captured. Is that correct?",
            "Was that a plan? Was the the plan PERSON5.",
            "No i don't know how subtitles, maybe the create subtitles and.",
            "No.",
            "-transcripts.",
            "Like I haven't seen that from them. I don't think. I am not sure they have it.",
            "Ok, yeah. So I don't have any plans for subtitles of the speech.",
            "I would not plan that either because we know that is. It is possible to do it, we have done it for my talk. But its.",
            "Complicated to do it.",
            "And it's not.",
            "-you can, yeah.",
            "-yeah. So, a better option actually it's to after recording PERSON5 speech to have it recognized and use the tool by PERSON3 to convert it to youtube subtitles.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So that's something that we could do.",
            "Yeah, so that we synchronize.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So these files will be also used in the video recording for PERSON5's speech. So I am saying these files because, actually not these once, because this is the exact test sets from the SLT task. So that's why I think it's a good idea to present it. These files could be, could be. Could also be. Okay. So here the idea is that is the domain and the exact files, which were part of the test set. And here the idea is. It is Czech that is being presented. And it is not evaluated in the shared task, but we can, show how the system runs the like delivers translation, from some language into English, which everybody will understand. So this is like more fun for the fully audience where this is more in line with the actual task. PERSON5 think about these two options. What would you prefer two half in the video, and I think both would make sense.",
            "Ok. I will see.",
            "Okay. So I think that's it right? I don't have any other ideas. So we managed in the half-hour. That's great. So thanks a lot. And again, let's plan to have this quick meeting next week, so there we up to date. But next week, we already should have the PERSON5 presentation finished and the recordings. There is lot of things to be done before next week. Before next Tuesday. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

            "Hello.",
            "Yeah works. So I guess there is no news. Or is there.",
            "Well apparently temporarily we stored some power.",
            "Okay.",
            "But they they will shut it off again, they have not told us yet. And and.",
            "Yeah yeah so I think that you should focus on copying over all the various files, because I think that we would really like to to a I'll write that to PERSON5 separately. But I think this this really confirms that everything, including our systems obviously needs to have a backup somewhere else a a tested backup.",
            "Yes. Maybe something like that happen although it will not happen today. The recommendation for us was actually to keep the servers off because.",
            "Oh okay, because they will.",
            "We don't know when the server when the power will actually turn off again. And I think the risk of actually using data is. The servers just unexpectedly shut down.",
            "That's thats true. Yeah.",
            "So we'll keep them off.",
            "So the your your keep them off. So you are not going to copy anything out. For the signal.",
            "No no no.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "When the power is back then we will. Then we will probably talk about how we can be more robust to this sort of failure. Because there will be construction there for. At least another year.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "I mean the situation with that server room is actually complicated anyway. We were supposed to vacate it like two years ago. But they didnt provide us an alternative where to put our servers and unless we all put our servers in our living rooms. We are we need it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I guess the good news is that it seems that the bomb was a false alarm.",
            "Okay.",
            "Anything anything else about that.",
            "Yeah. So there is one more thing that I would like to get from you. And that is in the slides. Which are in overleaf. So I guess you already have yeah you are maybe looking at those.",
            "I'm looking at them now and and checking where to where to put our stuff.",
            "Yes exactly. So there is a slide 21 end to end neural ASR, but well feel free to do any slides you like. This was just my suggestion.",
            "Overleaf is highlighting everything in red.",
            "Yeah not for me.",
            "Unclosed end document. Ok it seems like some of the beggining didnt match up. Which I fix now. Okay. I'm going to alert. Do you have to know when the notifications except for PROJECT3 for for.",
            "No? I don't.",
            "I thought it was supposed to be yesterday. But I cannot access the website because its posted on our servers.",
            "Oh. So the IWSLT is now without the website right?",
            "As far as I can see IWSLT.",
            "Okay. I dunno, I. I think someone told me it was the 15th so that technically means tomorrow midday.",
            "I think okay.",
            "But I don't I don't really know.",
            "Because I do have a paper in there that is relevant to to PROJECT3 you know. If it was accepted now that.",
            "Um-hum, um-hum.",
            "Most reasoned results we can put it on the slides.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We'll know.",
            "Hey guys, good morning.",
            "Hello, morning.",
            "Morning.",
            "So I'm still adding URL's to the. To the presentation. This is too complicated actually so I dunno how to. So PERSON17 would PERSON6 join as well?",
            "Hi.",
            "So PERSON6 is probably already there right? That was PERSON15, right. So PERSON17 would PERSON6 join would you know?",
            "Yes yes, he he minutes.",
            "Okay. In the minutes okay. And you are listening, you can hear us right? Okay, so PERSON11 can h is listening to to the Zoom call. But he doesnt have the microphone. Because that was causing the loop yesterday. So its only me who has a microphone. So PERSON15, v. How much time do you need? PERSON15 is not here. So PERSON15 is also trying to set up what what he posted yesterday. So that while watching the videos, a participants who do not speak Czech should be clicking to buttons, like how well they like the current subtitles, and it would be timestamped. And we can then align it and see like where the problems it is going to be approximate because the sync of the video. Is not perfect, as you know, but it still, will probably be useful to to identify the the to give us some measure of the overall usability of of that. So a please look up in your emails, because PERSON15 sent it this morning. The ORGANIZATION7 document and please sign up yourself if you can to the subtitle rating, documents, so. Whoever is available. Please write your name here that is what I'm going to highlight.",
            "I'm sorry I didnt catch it, where is it?",
            "In your email it it was into PROJECT3 yeah PROJECT3 it. Hi PERSON8.",
            "Hi, buttons.",
            "Yeah, so we'll I'm waiting for PERSON11 to confirm that the videos are ready. And I'm also waiting for PERSON15 to confirm that his instructions are ready.",
            "Its almost ready. I need PERSON11 for. For.",
            "So you, in the meantime you can look at the slides in Overleaf especially at the tail to add anything you may want to add in your future work.",
            "PERSON13 are you asking me?",
            "Not no this is for the slides thats for PERSON8 and ORGANIZATION5 and PERSON14 already is looking there. So thats if we want to show in the real demo. Any new findings or or any any like preview of plans for the upcoming months. This would be the place to to put it here.",
            "Okay thank you.",
            "Yep.",
            "We actually do have updates about the.",
            "Okay.",
            "Now there a news article.",
            "Oh great.",
            "Yeah its suspected to be an unexploded. They will they will further investigate on Tuesday 19th of May. Only then will they decide to whether or not a defusal will be necessary. When it will happen and what areas will be affected.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we can add to the to the slides with the.",
            "Yes.",
            "The bomb.",
            "Yes yes.",
            "Nice.",
            "We should've had demo last week. Everything was fine last week.",
            "Except for the demo. Okay yeah PERSON17 would you know the command line flag for FFM peg to stop at a certain position I think its like minus SS space and then.",
            "SS.",
            "SS is the starting position. And is the time time to stop.",
            "So so maybe PERSON17. So we are trying to cut the the second video which is an hour long. We are trying to pre process it but get only the first 15 minutes so that we don't have wait too long. But this is this is failing.",
            "Okay. I'm copying the base thing with.",
            "Ma I dunno if chatbox is best accessible to PERSON11. Yeah.",
            "I dunno well. Because anywhere.",
            "This should work. Okay nice.",
            "So PERSON11 says that within 10 minutes the conversion will be ready. So lets plan to start the demo at 11 to give us. 10 minutes. So at at 11 we will start with all the broadcasting as as yeah. As dry run thanks. So PERSON15 are you ready as well. PERSON11 says that he is testing it and.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah so in addition to the slides themselves, we are going to like ask you to annotate how much did you like the the subtitles at various stages of the subtitles being presented. PERSON15 has, so you are all looking at that instructions subtitle rating the document. Have a title there. And the webpage of the subtitle rating is very simple thing it contains just 5 or 6 buttons and the idea is that you will you should overlay this over the set of languages. And click what is your evaluation on these on this buttons. Whenever you have any opinion so the more you click the the better. But obviously, you should not, like damage your capacity of following the subtitles that because of this annotation. So we will also probably for other runs we will improve the user interface, so that its easier to to make your evaluation. And what the interface is doing. It is only only a recording timestamped evaluation. So don't worry if you like start looking at the subtitles too late, or if the video is it out of sync. So the the video out of sync is is little,, problem,, but there is not so much information in the video anyway. If you are like late with following the subtitles. That is not a problem at all. Your annotations will be simply in absolute, times aligned with when the subtitles are presented. So we will know what subtitles you are evaluating it at that moment. So that your annotation would be incomplete, but we will still have relevant portion. Yeah. So thats thats for the extra to task, and what I'm going to do now. Yeah, so PERSON11 is testing something something is appearing in the. So I'll just recompile the slides. Present the slides, share my screen and we will switch to the demo since PERSON11 will try to follow me as I'm as I will be giving the instruction and this will be live test. Of our like cooperation. Yeah, so. We have this demo session. And then.",
            "Okay, just just a your screen resolution is not enought you can avoid the three lines of subtitles just pressing CTRL - to decrease the zoom of the webpage.",
            "Yes yes excatly. So this is what also wanted to, to mention a when I'm getting the instructions. But I do not have the shortcut there. So maybe I should add the shortcut also to the to the slides. And I will have this one. Yeah okay so.",
            "I checked the optimal screen resolution. And it should be 1920 for 1080 but of course i also a secondary monitor and it doesnt match of resolution so I just control and minus and it works.",
            "Okay, so I suggest that we get started. We don't have any external watchers who have asked or PERSON15 has asked or so our colleagues, but none of them has responded. So it would be just us if I'm not mistaken. Yep. Yeah, okay,, and I'm going to start sharing my screen now. So there is now now you are hopefully seeing my screen and you are hopefully seeing the the slides. And there is. I'm trying to hide the. Okay. So there is one thing, which would be useful for you to know when we are giving the demo, and thats how to minimize or like an and how to demaximize the screen sharing now, because I know that zoom is stealing all your, desktop space. And so at the top of the screen share window. You c there is some button, which, which allows you to like a a leave the full screen mode. And in that case, you will still see my screen shared but in a separate window. And you can also go back to a web browser, which would be needed for the demo afterwards. So I hope that everybody is now paying attention to, the test presentation, and I'm going to start. I hope that you can see my slides. Welcome to this dry run of a demo of the PROJECT3 project. Here is the overview. We are. I'm first going to briefly discuss the goals of the project, and the current status of the development. And then we will have most of the time devoted to the demo sessions. There would be actually two demo sessions and the first one will be subtitling stream videos, and there would be another one. Where we will be trying to follow our discussions and have it live transcribed into multiple languages. And then we will. We will have, some time, for any of your questions or comments. And depending on how long we spend with this time. I will also present the future plans that we have withim PROJECT3. So to start with PROJECT3 description. We have multiple,, research and innovation goals. We are trying to to improve multilingual machine translation system, and also to include a processing of speech. At the beginning of the pipeline for machine translation. We are also looking at the document level coherence. And that includes both written documents as well as spoken documents, so speeches,, and. We have also a separate goal, which is the automatic summarization, especially of meetings, which we call minuting. There are three research partners, and two companies in the in the project the project is coordinated at ORGANIZATION6, and we have ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION9 Institute of technology. As the research partners. ORGANIZATION5 is our integrator partner. And ORGANIZATION4 is one user partners, and we also have an affiliated like separate like outside of the project consortium, but still close the link user partner and thats the ORGANIZATION8. And the ORGANIZATION8 provides the project with a main event. Where we are supposes to test the technology and the technology of lif live speech translation into text. Is going to be used in the ORGANIZATION1 congress. The Congress was shifted by one year. So its going to happen in may 2021, and this has been just conference. So we know the exact date of of this Congress. Thats luckily still within the time frame of the PROJECT3 project. So it would be easy to to respond to this new new changed conditions. The project is research and innovation project. And that means that some of the activities that we are doing. Are, well, understood. And, they only need to be put into practice. Thats the innovation part. And some of the activities of some of the goals are still too unknown, and we are combining both of these goals. So machine translation and speech translation have been studied for decades. And, they are close to becoming more useful in practice. But what is new is the high highly multilingual aspect. And thats what we are of researching, or studying in in our project. And also one machine translation works for some language pairs very well, at the level of sentences the level of the whole documents is still a very much unreliable. So there can be incoherence into translations of of various types. And thats also what we are looking at. And the topic of a meeting summarization. That is highly, unknown area so obviously this summarization has been studied. And transcripts of meetings are also being recorded. But still the task of automatic summarization of meetings into meeting minutes is something which has not been put up as a research task. For example, as a shared task for a conferences. So that we are just like paving the land for, for future research, by collecting data, creating some baseline models, but it cannot be expected that we will deliver working solution for this task within the project. This is a picture of summary of that,, we I just wanted to illustrate that by spoken language translation. We mean, the concatenation of a processing speech. Into the transcript of one language possibly. And then, going to the to the translation in the other language. The spoken language translation can be done in two steps, a as separate system for speech recognition and separate system for speech translation. And, the minuting is is something which uses this transcript to populate the agenda with with minutes. And here with the colors. I again, that ASR the spoken the speech recognition and machine translation. A separate tasks have been studied a lot but the spoken language translation as one shot end to end task is something which is still a under research. And and so is the automatic minutinh. PROJECT3 is quite ambitious, in terms of languages covered. So we have a was seven source languages. So we are developing or improving systems for speech recognition of English German French, Spanish it during Russian and were also experimenting with Czech, and we are a targeting primarily a subset of these languages. English German Czech but we are covering all European languages. And actually experimental. We are trying to cover all 43 languages that are needed by our affiliated user partner, the ORGANIZATION8, who who are connected in the ORGANIZATION1 consortium. Yeah. So, with this many target languages, and this many source languages, and with the ambition to do subtitling of of a Congress. We know that this cannot be achieved without serious testing. So we had this time line of events in the project proposal. There was a a. It was planned to have to, to, two two test events that the ORGANIZATION8 has provided. But we are adding many more other events. So here is summary we started already. In the third month of the project. We started with testing and preexisting technology, to see how it works in practice. We got in touch with, in interpreters students of interpretation, a difficulty of arts of a ORGANIZATION6. They run mo conferences and interpret them to, to practice interpretation, and we are, and connected to that, and we are getting there a data. And we are using that as as a benchmark, and a a comparative resource to, to relate our systems to the performance of humans in the task. There was, the, the workshop on value added text, which was the first event that the ORGANIZATION8 ran for us. And there was another event last October. And then we added the, the the demonstration of the system at the University open doors day. Then we try to demo it at at one of like social events in LOCATION1. And we are also preparing for workshop that will describe language technologies to to employees of the ORGANIZATION8 so that they know what computers can do and how computers can help in their daily practise. So this is the tools workshop which had dry run in February. And the first real successful public demo happened last November at University open doors day. The best of prg.ai event was actually a an a failure. And the reason was that the WiFi was overloaded when the audience came. So the test fully worked before the audience came, and then the audience came. And suddenly our system was not able to deliver the sound to our systems, because people simply have their cell phones nearby. They didnt use them, but still the the network failed. And in the lengtools workshop dry run with the, an employees of ORGANIZATION8 the whole system worked well technically. But there we ran into the issue that the users are actually overloaded by the translations, and it is hard to follow even if the translations are, are acceptable. So aside from technological problems were also fighting with like user, usability problems. And this is probably something that you will also experience today. When working on the systems under the hood. We take part in various competitions, and we are also running a shared task dedicated to this in IWSLT. So, there is many, many events where we testing parts or parts of the system or the system as a whole. If the, should demo fail today. There are a luckily some recorded demos from the the previous events. So here is summary of links, the first demo from the very beginning of the project, the students then the, the short demo at the University open doors day which worked pretty well. Then I was giving detailed lecture on the technical aspects like, how what is why is it so difficult to translate speech,, highlighting all the problems that can arise. And this lecture, a was a live subtitled. And you can see our our English subtitles appearing at the bottom of this lights in in the recording of of this lecture. What you don't see any more are the live translation of of the. So if you want to see the, the live translations appearing. Then we have a lecture snippets actually this this video content, just a few snippets from a lecture given by a colleague of mine, PERSON4 in Czech and that is being live translated into many target languages. And you can you can see the video and and try to follow. What is what is being said. Here is an overview of the architecture. I do not want to go into the detail. But we have mediator central point in that architecture and their systems from the various researh partners, connected to the mediator and then someone who needs to process the sound will connect as a client and the the sound from the client would be processed through this complex pipeline of speech recognition, sentence segmentation, machine translation. And then it will be published on the web. And the user can then look at the website to to see to see the subtitles. These connection to the workers are always open. So they are reused. So the start up is pretty quick. But its based on TCP communication. So it actually relies on network throughput. And if there is heavy traffic that can cause problem. So over the many test events. We have observed many issues with sound acquisition there is whole signs behind that, how to receive sound and record it. So that is sufficient of sufficient quality for speech recognition. We have had slowdowns at the ASR research partners for some network issues. We have had queueing of web events. So everything was actually processed and available on time. But the end users web browser was overloaded, and therefore it,, displayed the subtitles too too late. And then, you know, that our demo was was was found, and that is because the power line to ORGANIZATION9 servers room was cut by digger. And there would be one more picture with the bomb. So you see that even if everything is well prepared. And if the architecture allows for like duplicated workers it still can be pretty challenging to to get it running on the on the spot. So for the ORGANIZATION1 congress we will have to have all the workers replicated across sites, and we will have to have a fully running a secondary solution, in case someone cuts a wire again. So now lets go for demoes. Yeah, the first demo is subtitling of stream videos. And for this, there is so for this I would like to highlight that this is slightly from the users point of view, its slightly different setup. Out for this. I would like to highlight dead. This is slightly from the users point of view. It is slightly different set up. And from technic point of view is is pretty new setup compared to what is planned to what was planned in the PROJECT3 project. We were always expected to just acquire sound and provide the sound with the text the translations. But now we are for the demo, which has to be run remotely. We are also expected to actually broadcast the sound. And that should be in sync in sync at the same time as as the subtitles are processed. So we have spent multiple weeks in preparation for this new set up actually, and the solution that we have is is not as a user convenient as we would have liked. Its we are not developing new YouTube platform unfortunately. And we cannot rely on YouTube Platform because we cannot rebroadcast the movies that that the video they have already there because they would immediately stop us from broadcasting. So while we have a setup where we can life subtitle YouTube broadcasts. We cannot run these broadcasts with prerecorded videos because then they would ban us. So we are doing our own streaming. And for this to work if you are using a Firefox then it would be helpful if you could allow autoplay in in Firefox. So if you can go to the PROJECT3.ORGANIZATION5.com webpage. And then when you are there. If you can click on this on this. On this icon next to the URL bar. And allow autoplay that will simplify the the playback in sync with the subtitles. If you don't have Firefox, or you do not find the setting. What you will have to do when looking at the subtitles you will have to open the web page, with the video and click the play button thats indicated as one here, and then because your your browser can be somewhat late compared to our streaming of that of that video. You have to click, at the end of the bar to move to the life, a to the life, watching of of the video. And to validate that you are receiving the videos correctly. You will see that the duration of the video is constantly growing as we are streaming more and more content. So you should be always watching the varied tale of the video as it is coming to your web browser. So this is our broadcasting. And their underneath below that that video. There would be the subtitles. And you can choose which languages you want to see a by clicking on the language buttons. We have for use the set of languages to keep the user interface, complexity reasonable. And, as you may,, need to reuse the font size. So here is a summary. So right now I'll make this make this slide smaller, and you are still seeing my screen. And I'll try to demonstrate what you should prepare on your screens as well. So no, no, no, this is this is the right user interface. So you should you should go to this web page. There are some some dum some dummy subtitles appearing there. So please go to the Web page, PROJECT3 ORGANIZATION5.com. And if you are prompted for login then enter the username PROJECT3 at PROJECT3 EU. And the password is PROJECT3. And I'm going to to show that here. Here, you see the the subtitle, sometimes do not fit. So I hit control minus. And maybe once more so that the two lines of the subtitles fit well on in my screen. And so that is that is one important thing to reduce the font size. If your browser doesnt show it correctly. With the default setting, and then, because our platform is a poor substitute of of YouTube. You will have to reload the webpage and you will have to like depreload, so control shift R to start watching the video. So at the moment. My web pages is is showing some old part of of the video, and I would now like to ask my colleague, to to get ready for broadcasting the video for all of us. So he will let me know, and I will let you all know. That you should when you should press the control shift R on your screen on the PROJECT3 webpage. To get the fresh video appearing. So remember to remember to allow auto play if you can use that. And if you cannot auto play then after the shift reload. You will have to click the play button and click at the end of the bar of of the of the video. If you are late with this clicking. That is not a big problem problem. The subtitles will be running as the video like in sync with the video, but you will be watching the video late. And whenever you click the the most recent,, a bar whenever you get back to the live watching of the video that would be that would become again in in sync. So, there is no,, the the this can be done at any point during the the full video. So if you are very late that is not a problem. Just reload the page again, maybe if you lost and click play and click on the end of the bar to get the live presentation of of the video. The subtitles are independently presented, and they are always in sync with the main broadcasting. Yeah so I got a the signal that my colleague PERSON11 has already started the video. So lets all do the control shift r. And I'm going to play it. Yeah. Yeah so I'm going to leave it running, you can play with the languages and follow the subtitles which you would like to follow. And I'm going to anotate also it with the quality of of the transcript.",
            "PERSON7 we can hear the audio from this video.",
            "Sorry say it again.",
            "We hear the audio from the video through your.",
            "I don't hear because I hear the I'll stop my watching of the video. Say it again sorry.",
            "We can hear the audio from the video through Zoom through you.",
            "Oh, I didnt allow Zoom to do that. Okay, so I'm.",
            "It sounds more like its being picked up by microphone somewhere.",
            "Okay, from my headphones, thats strange. So i hope its better now.",
            "Yeah yeah so the video is over. That was just a first 15 minutes, so can someone confirm that you can hear me.",
            "Yes we can hear you.",
            "Yeah yeah okay great. So I'll share my screen for a second like for us in addition to, that. Yeah. So this is the the set up that I had for myself in the end, I use this subtitle rating window. And I used it for a while, when looking at the subtitles in the subtitle view. And then I modified my view so that I saw the paragraphs, because well, I know how to access it. And I was a rating the English,, subtitles for a while, English transcript for a while. And then I was also annotating the the quality of the Czech. And we can discuss the the technical your observations in afterwards, I suggest now that we go for the second video, the shorter one, the 3 minute run right? And yeah, PERSON11 is getting ready. And again, feel free to choose whatever interface you like. For the real demo people will should be watching the subtitle view in the PROJECT3 platform PROJECT3 ORGANIZATION5 platform. So this one and.",
            "I can show you the final unprocessed results if you want.",
            "Yes, so I'm I'm stopping my screen sharing for a second. Or maybe can we do it after the second video as well.",
            "Yes, in the document if you want to see.",
            "Okay yeah. So who is curious about the results.",
            "It seems that its horrible.",
            "Its horri yeah exactly.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes yeah unfortunately the the translation was fine I think but I had to stop reading it also get headache.",
            "Yeah yeah so lets lets discuss this later on. But actually, the Czech transcript looking at the Czech transcript this PERSON7 watching Czech paragraphs in the document. Its often also perfect perfectly usable like one or a usable with a as as some problems or a reasonable. So, so that the Czech transcript is actually not that bad. The segmentation is is bad. And the segmentation causes a flicker for the translation. And that translation is is heavily damaged by the bad segmentation. So this is the problems that we have at the moment of. And also for this video it was really really like it is difficult content that we do not know. So maybe if we watch content that we would be understandable to us. It would be also better. But still, the problem would that the machine translation system is too much relying on the segments which are wrong. So PERSON11. Are you ready for the second video? So everybody, PERSON11 wait, wait, oh, okay. So PERSON11 has already started it. Yeah so everybody. Please go to the to the screen. As I have it now and do a shift reload and click play and play the video for yourself and watch the subtitles. Yeah okay, so the video is over, I'm stopping my screen sharing in case have that. And lets lets do the discussion and in the meantime PERSON11 can try to switch the subtitling to do Czech ASR of the Zoom talk, so then with PERSON15 we'll discuss something in Czech and you will watch us in the paragraph. Before that happens we can discuss our observations yeah PERSON11 right. So PERSON15 should should people be people who will be looking at the paragraph you. Should they be also clicking the the rating?",
            "Right now? For.",
            "Yeah, once PERSON11 starts this.",
            "Its up to you, you can.",
            "Yeah yeah so so it would it would be useful as well. So I'll quickly share my screen.",
            "Who followed which language in the first video and in second video.",
            "Yes so that we know this. So everybody please say, which language you have followed.",
            "Or you can do inserted into subtitle reating. I think everyone followed English but PERSON14 maybe it was German.",
            "Yes, I looked at the German.",
            "Yeah. Yes, and here second video.",
            "Yeah, so in in the meantime. This is so we have just had the the demo with the lif subtitling of a video. And then the demo the second will be the paragraph you of the discussion here. Here the link is different. And well you can, as as I will probably that is, what should do. I should actually paste this link to the chat window. So that people can. Can follow it. We'll still somehow need to simplify the the way of getting the link to you. But you know, the link yourself, right? Please everybody confirm that, you can open the, the user, the paragraph you.",
            "I'm going to open.",
            "Yeah. There is no way to copy the link. Yeah so I cannot really copy the link because it it like changes it immediately. And it opened the wrong web browser and so on. So this is I will keep it for you to.",
            "Chat.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think it redirects you. But theres nothing so far.",
            "It depends. So if you reloaded, obviously there would be nothing. And there should some garbage be. Yeah. So I think started right. It started PERSON11. So PERSON11 will start it will start subtitling. If I start speaking Czech. Then yeah, it recognizes me.",
            "Yes we do see understandable English subtitles with quite a lot of delay. So we are switching back to English and now the subtitles will become horrible. So I think PERSON11 maybe if yoyu can kill it so that it doesnt scroll too far.",
            "No honestly the translation is fine, I'm I'm I can read it its not perfect but read the German transcript no problem.",
            "Yeah okay, and were you able to click that also in the user interface or no you have just the general impression.",
            "The the rating thing no.",
            "Is it, yeah nevermind.",
            "I know this clip I can click in the and I get some debug output.",
            "Yes this is something that I forgot to mention and we may want to like disable it for the demo. The the reason is that if you want to copy and error you cannot copy it from the scrolling window so thats why you get this separate tab with that so you can easily take a record of of the of the problem. So thats indeed a mental like a debug few. So.",
            "I am interested in whether you. The Czech transcript looks like its in Czech. But interestingly, in the in the German translational of saying about the video that I selected. In English thats pretty good. My guess is probably multilingual system opinion confuse sometimes. Again its probably what you said but it is very good to draw that pretty good out.",
            "Thats pretty good, thats pretty good ouch. Okay. This is interesting. Yeah. So I do not know how that show up so which which German, who is producing the German. Is it PERSON8 system right?",
            "Right now.",
            "No, how is the German produced. The German comes from English. The German comes from English right. Sorry, which worker? So PROJECT2 workers from, running here. So its PERSON8's model. Or. Yeah so well PERSON11 says its probably PERSON8's model. He's not totally sure.",
            "Sorry, so its being pivoted through English? You think.",
            "I think.",
            "It could be that thats actually yeah.",
            "I think its being pivoted to English. But there was no need to do this. Right. Its MT. So that English to German is PROJECT1. Okay, yeah. So again, we see some serious think we really need to know which models we are using. And we need to have these models evaluated because right now like I thought that. The preffered model would be the multilingual Czech to many languages that PERSON8 has trained, right? That would be the best choice would need. We don't have to PERSON8 has the model which goes directly from Czech to many languages.",
            "That model was a very late edition. So. I mean configure the worker couple a couple days ago I think.",
            "Hum, yeah.",
            "And the translations to.",
            "But he has not evaluated yet. Yeah, I can seen any I havent seen the score from PERSON12 yet. So, so we should really carefully evaluate, which of this systems are to be used. And so this is now for the coming days through like finalise the set up for. So for each of the setups. You should have a a script. And that should contain the right workers selection. And it has to be evaluated. And like double check that the set up is the set up that we want. So like technically now everything was put together. And thats great that it worked and its great that you understood. There was a huge delay, because the segmenter is new, and it has a window of 100 words. I was told by a PERSON15 in in Czech, and this window is probably too big. And also it is a big,, neural model, which is now being run on CPU's. So we don't know its performance. And that was that was causing the delay. And I'm actually surprised that,, the translations that I followed when I was clicking the rating interface were not that bad. Given this this huge limitations, so. I saw a lot of resets when the subtitles have to scroll back,? And the same content is like repeated again, because the punctuation has end has changed in the in the process,, and that was very frequent with this run. So we need to reduce the the length of of the window, that the segmenter sees. So we'll do some,, like, tuning of of the set up early next week. And hopefully we'll be able to come up with something more stable in the subtitles. And also we will have the numbers from PERSON12 and we'll carefully select which model still to use. So the overall set up. I think it is a really good idea to start with the longer lecture, which has worse impression, which is harder to follow. And then to move to the shorter video, and ideally the longer lecture would be the one that PERSON14 has selected. About the coca cola guy,. And their he,. I followed that I will. I listen to the the beginning of the of the talk, and he also speaks pretty fast. So it will have the same problem. But hopefully the topic will be not so difficult for, the general audience, so that people could recover based on their word \"knowledge. Yeah, so that is that is my hope, but we should evaluate this. Any any further comments to to this.",
            "Well, I really enjoy the the demo, I'm really happy to see that actually some everything is working pretty well, I followed the English translation. Which was well really good, the only point I would like to highlight is that in the first video several times the word dog has been.",
            "Yes yes thats the ypsos. I looked at the slides. And there is there is an abbreviation. IPS as a something. And this is miss recognized as pes or psa, and thats the dog.",
            "The corresponding German translation has been translating in hund which is dog too. And this is quite annoying.",
            "Yeah. This is an ASR error.",
            "Yes. I think that this is the only ASR error I would like to mention. I some name in the. I don't remember when what what I recorded everything. At some point if my internet connection will help me I will upload the all the recorded video somewhere. Was fine the only thing as you know is the flickering problem of subt in particular, when the speaker speaks really fast. Or this is just my my feeling when the the the discussion goes lets say out of domain from the ASR. The ASR starts changing really frequently the the transcription on the translation flickers a lot. But discussion is pretty much on domain the flickering problem is slightly slightly better. Works better. Thats all from my side, thank you for this I also enjoy these lights I like your idea to I like with different colours research and innovation. Maybe do not call presentation platform substitute of YouTube if possible.",
            "Thats was just the streaming thing. You and there we are substituting. So I should be clear about this or.",
            "But this is everything on my side, I really enjoyed this. This demo.",
            "Yeah, okay thank you. So had one question, but I forgot what, what was or what one comment and that was yes. The the flicker you said that the ASR is changing frequently, when it is like out of domain. It is the the sequence of words is not changing. It is only the punctuation and casing which is changing. So as far as I know, the Czech system is. And it only grows. It only adds words. But the segmentation and thats what we discussed already before. That causes the disruptions. So we need to have like tune this.",
            "I checked the. I dunno if the same kind of system we use the in the. In the French watchin session, if its. But the French transcription change also, its not the only.",
            "That was a different system so that was ORGANIZATION9.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, so I think.",
            "I mean depending on on you know my accepting or not accepting all the. I will have something also specifically to that to add to the future work section. Because I am developing model that we'll not need segmenter.",
            "Oh okay yes, that would be great. So I'm not going to discuss the the details here. I've added to tables. We may not discuss this in the in in the real demo as well. So this is this is too my two master students. One working on the domain adaptation. And then, that we are going to gather all the talk. So for this. It would be I think very good if we could really use the language model data for the ASR. So if we could inject the that the related or maybe even the the planned transcript of the speech. Not like the, or well, in our case we will be injecting the the real transcript manually corrected. But many of the speeches are delivered a be by reading kind of, or they are written by some by team of members of the of the group, and then only delivered by the head of the group. And in these circumstances. It is totally OK and, actually no cheating to have the transcript as part of the training data for the system. So this is what we would like to include in the London in the real set up for the Congress. And where we have a very simple, a file uploading interface, and we have the pipeline, which distills plain text from that. So if we could get the demo, also with a ASR workers that have language model adapt language models adapted to these videos. That would be excellent. So PERSON14 please confirm early next week, whether this would be possible or not for your systems.",
            "You have to correct that to PERSON8. Yes for the pipe models we can do that. We've we've been doing that often, so thats definitely something we can do to add unknown words to the language model. I do not know how much actually the language model is retrained or not.",
            "Yeah, its not just. So actually, we. This is what we already have with with the copy of your worker, which I dunno know, whether was recovered after the unfortunate delete. That happened two days ago. So PERSON11 was was was it recovered? Do we have the ORGANIZATION9 work ASR worker here. Yeah, so we can do this lexicon adaptation. That was not done for today, but we can do it. And we already have the data for that, and what we are not doing. So would be the language.",
            "If I can just finish my point, as far as I know we currently don't have a facility to do that for end to end speech recognition model. Which was one of the points of criticism and against going to end to end. But we are doing that. So that would be an open area of research I suppose.",
            "Um-hum, yeah. So that, that would be that would also be best mentioned in this future work slides.",
            "Speaking of those can you invite PERSON8 to the.",
            "Its a, it is a public link so you must not share the link that you see. But we we we have to send him the link that I've put in the ORGANIZATION7 Document. So Overleaf is Overleaf is obscruing the the public access, and, its only like the first link that works. And you get the second link, which is now a personalised for you. And you don't you cannot share it further.",
            "Oh right, hold on.",
            "Is in one of the ORGANIZATION7.",
            "In the ORGANIZATION7 docs yes yes yes. I'll search for overleaf and I'll do editable slides. So I'll do one thing copy link URL where is the overleaf. I'll put it at the very beginning. Agenda.",
            "Okay I send them the update.",
            "Yeah so I'll also put it. So its actually in the slides themselves. There is now the link that work. Okay, so please also ask PERSON8, if he could figure out whether he can inject not only the. We we can inject the the vocabulary, but whether he could inject the texts for us, because that would be. That would be helpful. So please.",
            "To exactly output the transcript.",
            "Yeah, because for some of these videos, we we can easily go for video which has a corrected transcript. And, we could in the demo session, we could, run first, like the the the than the the non assisted one. And then we could move to a system, which knows what is going to be set.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Because this is natural set up there for many of the speeches. That is well known what is going to be set. Not the exact words but what is changing is actually just the full of words. And the words are are recognized pretty well. So my impression is that the ASR, and even the segmentation. Works very well for this generic, like a low content sentences. And this is this is what is changing when people are giving speeches that are pre-written.",
            "Okay, how about you put that into an email, because I think, you know, best exactly how you imagine this.",
            "Well, just we will send you the plain text file. And we want this to be heavily promoted in the language model, that the anagrams.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, please do it to and if if if I get if if every, I will do it as well, its better to us not at all. OK. So, Yeah. One last thing,? Two things. Hopefully on Wednesday, ORGANIZATION9 will know both about the electricity and the bomb. So on Wednesday we should should create a new doodle poll to ask for the substitute slot for the for the demo, right? So PERSON17 please take care of that.",
            "Sorry?",
            "So please take care of preparing a new doodle poll for the project officer and ourselves.",
            "Yes.",
            "When exactly. Yeah exactly and I guess that on Wednesday we should know the availability of ORGANIZATION9 building.",
            "Optimistic.",
            "No I'm not saying that the building will be available on Wednesday. I'm saying that we will know when it will be available.",
            "We have an estimate.",
            "Yeah, we'll have an estimate yeah. Okay.",
            "We had estimates before of course.",
            "Yeah yeah. And the other thing is that, so we'll be doing these evaluations. We may ask you for some evaluations by clicking as well, and we will try to do it ourselves as as much as possible. One important lesson I've learnt with this demo prepations. Is that we must avoid switching for new components before the demo. So there has to be at least I dunno know like, I would say like week of testing of the exact set up on the exact inputs that we are going to show whether assisted like domain adapted or not that is that is like a decision. That is made once. But it has to be tested the exact command the exact workers and no changes in that before the demo, because and improved segmenter. Was actually killing the show today,, because it was causing the subtitles to reset too much. So there are too many parameters in the whole pipeline. And we really need to be sure that the bids that we have put together are compatible with each other. And the better component can actually damage the the overall performance, and it had happened. So please take keep this in mind that is a message important for everybody. And in the long term, we really need to have for like two running versions. One will be the production version, which contains things that have been tested for number of weeks on the development running version. And this development runing version is the thing that we can, that we can damage easily, but something will have to first work in the development running version for a week, and only then we'll put it to the production version, and then we will not touch it, even if we have a better solution. So this is something that we really have to have, like separate the development version and the and the production version. Okay, so I think that that could be it for me. I do not know whether you want to discuss something else. The Zoom call will be still running. If if you like.",
            "Yes I would like to ask PERSON6 which language did you follow. If you can confirm. Was it English?",
            "Yes was English.",
            "In all.",
            "In all the time, yes.",
            "Okay thanks.",
            "I'm sorry I I I barely made it to understand a bit.",
            "You don't have to apologise. Its.",
            "PERSON17 and do you check discussion, was it English?",
            "English yes.",
            "Yeah thanks. And Ond PERSON7.",
            "I wrote it in in the name so if if I didnt write anything it was English and I was also watching Czech in the paragraph you and the name indicates it. So I actually used the name in the response form to indicate what I was watching.",
            "Okay thanks.",
            "Great. Ok. So I'm I'm leaving thanks to everybody. For that, all the work. And, yeah. We can thank the bump. And and the bigger forward, the extra days that we got. But at the same time I would like this demo to be like already after us so that we have passed the demo whatever the result will be. Because it is quite stressful. I dunno know how for you. But, but for me. It is the really a little bit. Over. My capacity. No not really capacity but the level of stress that I can handle well. Okay, so thanks and keep discussing whatever needs to be discussed I dunno maybe PERSON11 can. If if there is PERSON11. Anything that PERSON11 needs to ask. He can no. Okay. So I'm. I'm just connecting me and yeah, so we'll be in touch over the email we'll find another slots for test and then the slots for the demo. So thanks a lot.",
            "Bye.",
            "Thank you bye bye.",
            "Bye.",

            "Thanks PERSON7 for joining us, thanks to PERSON3 as well.",
            "You're welcome.",
            "So - so PERSON2 w. We're going to discuss all the data alright today?",
            "Yes, do you like me to present which data we have and so how much and how does it look like, yes?",
            "Yes, yes. Because I think PERSON7 is also interested to doing some experiments as - in - in our meetings, So it would be great if you can have overview of which data we have and -",
            "Okay, so I will share the - the screen with the table and we'll speak and show you the table. And if you have any questions, please, ask. You're, because maybe I'm not quite sure what - which information you sh you want to know, So just a moment. I will just turn on the screen sharing. There. Can you hear - Can you - can you see that?",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yes.",
            "So the link to that table you can find in the agenda. So you can also open it yourself and use it. Otherwise - So it looks like that, It has different aspects, that I marked. And - So two big parts - English meetings - this are all English meetings up to here, And then Czech meetings. So as for English meetings, they are divided into groups according to the topic. Most of our English meetings are form PROJECT1 - from the PROJECT1 group. So Surge meeting, our general report meetings, then some th discussions and something - some - some others. We also have some meetings from PROJECT2 and about 10 meetings from the PROJECT3 group. This is the group of our Czech colleagues and now they have one Polish colleague, So they switched from Czech into English, and these are this English meetings. And this PROJECT2 - Czech PROJECT2 is the group - the internal group of people working on the PROJECT2 project. So this is different from calls. These are just our internal colleagues. These are the groups, now here we have the duration of the meeting. This are kind of - this is kind of technical column, that I marked for myself if I treamed it or not, So I worked with audio and then I gave it to PERSON6, to prepare the automatic speech reconstruction. And he ma he made me the Czech transcript in textual form, And then I gave them th automatic transcript to annotators. These are the codes, the first letter of name and surname of the annotator who worked on this meetings. And then they prepared the correction of the automatic transcript and minutes. As for correction, I always gave each to one colleague, And these - To one anotator, and he prepared - he corrected the transcript and then as - as well as he already knew what was going on in the meeting, he also prepared the minutes for this meeting. And for - I tried to duplicate it so to achieve more than one minute for a meeting. So I gave already tran corrected transcript, not the automatic transcript but the already corrected, to another annotator, And he listened to the meeting again, corrected the mistakes if they were there, So they mostly - mostly there are some typos something like that, corrected it and prepared other minutes. So for example here, for the first PROJECT1 Surge from 24th January 2020 there were two annotators working on the - the meeting. A so we have actually three transcripts - originally done by one annotator and then corrected by second and then one small corrected by the third one. And four people created the minutes, so we have four minutes of this meeting. Then we have manual transcript, so this I just marked that we have it so that I can count it in the statistic line below, I will show you. This is for the same purpose so I just counted how many minutes we have or. This is a we have transcripts our minutes twice, And this is the concept duration of what you have. So the statistics is here, after each language there is a line of statistics. So generally we have 105 meetings. The duration - the general duration of all meetings is 116 hours and half. Put of them we have 76 manual transcripts and 76 minutes. So this is the - the numbers, actually always the same, because it's kind of rule to give me back corrected transcripts and minutes. And for 33 of of these - 33 transcripts are twice - 33 min meetings are twice transcribed and 29 meetings are at least twice minuted. And this is the duration of annotated meetings. So we have 80 hours - almost 80 hours of meetings, which are manually transcribed. It means that automatic transcripts have been manually corrected and manually minuted. Well, this is for English. An for Czech we have PROJECT3 group. This a these are our Czech colleagues. They began to have meetings in Czech. That's why many meetings are in Czech and they are here. Then there is an internal PROJECT2 group. They also have begun in Czech, but then - then they get an international colleague and switched to English. That's why we have also English PROJECT2 - Czech PROJECT2. And this is the LOCATION1 com. So this is - this is an external colleague Pra. How to - Just a moment, I - How to - ORGANIZATION3. They have very nice meetings of different kind. They're good - very well structured. And they agreed to record them for us, So this is - So we have also meetings from them. And as for statistics, generally of - for Czech we have 55 hours and out of them 50 - We have 50 transcripts and 50 minutes. And for 40 meetings are double annotated. So we have 40 - 52 hours of annotated meetings. This is the presentation, please ask. Maybe not, just a moment. I also - I will also show you some other sheets. This is my table of annotators. This is the list of annotators. These people are working for English and this three people are working for Czech. And here I just write out when they got the transcript and when they gave it back. So this is just my internal table. This is the sheet I began to list the people who attended a meeting to to control the ethics - If the if they sent the ethics protocol - the consent forms. So I think it could be. This is all I can present, maybe you can ask me for something.",
            "Okay. So, thanks you for presenting the. So, one quick question. Is. For the shared task do you think that we should be annotating more? Beause essentially we have - If - if I'm talking from point of view, essentially we are having -",
            "I can hardly hear you - Sorry, could you just get a little bit closer to the microphone? If we get from which point of view? And then - and then what?",
            "Yeah, PERSON2, can you - can you hear me?",
            "I'll try to. So it seems that you're little bit far away, I don't know, what's - what's the problem.",
            "Okay. So, what - what I'm trying to say is that you think that - Like I would also like to listen from others that the number of instances that we have currently for the meetings are a bit less from a machine learning point of view.",
            "So what? I just - I don't understand the question.",
            "So, I'm asking that the data set that we have currently, we have more annotations, right? Because I can see we have 76 instances of English data and around 50 instances of Czech data, right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So I think that for using the data, as far for the shared task we need to do more, But what should be the - like what should be the exact number we should target, I don't know, but -",
            "I don't know. I have no idea how much you should, How - I have no idea how much data we should release for the shared task.",
            "Yeah, so that is something - Maybe we need to think about.",
            "So, why not the proposition was to use other open meeting corpora ESCI. Each - Probably they can be proposed. There is hardware difference in how minutes or kind of summaries are organised, because what really - what ORGANIZATION1 corpus has are actually not minutes in our understanding. They have either an abstact of kind of coherent text for each meeting. So they have abstract of summaries and this is an - coherent paragraph of text for each meeting. All of them have some abstactive summaries and these are excerpts of lines from the transcript. So neither of this refers to what we call minutes.",
            "Alright.",
            "It's all then.",
            "Excuse me PERSON2, what did you say that abstractive summaries in are not related to the minutes that we have for -",
            "They definit. No, they are definitely related, of course, but they have a little bit different form, it should be stated.",
            "Definitely kind of close to that, but they have just different form.",
            "And by the firm format you mean the format that they are saved or format that -",
            "No, no no, no. No, the idea - I don't mean - Seved we can of course convert it anyhow. But - So in ORGANIZATION1 corpus the first of all the meetings are mostly played specially for the corpus. So 70 corpus was ha played. Spec. The meetings were organise specially to for the corpus to be created.",
            "Yes.",
            "Annotator was asked to listen to the ch to the - to the minute - to the meetings or to the Aha. and to write a paragraph of text.",
            "Yes, I get it, I guess.",
            "So we don't have paragraph of text, we have kind of bull pointed points that were discussed and some decissions mabe, some generalisations, But they look differently. So it could be stated at least. We can use it. Definitely they are summaries. But a little bit different form - format.",
            "Yeah, I got.",
            "And something else I want to ask is that: Do we have the access to the participants of each meetings? The - the thing that PERSON4 wanted me to change and you told me that you will kind of organise it.",
            "You mean - you mean from - for consent - for our consents?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes, mostly we h. So definitely we have e-mail adresses to all or them. Mostly they are kind of colleagues, so we have really - I think it should be - So I should be - so I should - If you take - if you begin to work with that, I w I will really. I. So really help you a lot in that, so adjust the people, not - not to gi to let it to the overview.",
            "Yes, but, something is that we have to rename the characters in each meetings. And for that w I have to - I have to r. I require having the every name in each meetings. So we have that?",
            "Yes, I will show you. Again, so just a moment. How we looks like. Share screen. Screen - Can you see my screen? For example. Can you see my screen?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So what we have in manually generated minutes - we have the name of attendees, for example.",
            "So mostly so or sometimes they are not - Mostly they are surnames. And - But this - this is the names I use - that I used in - in the meetings, And we can reconstruct the surnames if needed.",
            "Aha, so I can work on this right away, yes? We have a minute.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I - I - can you hear my voice?",
            "Yes, but I'm maybe - Yes, I can hear your voice very good.",
            "Yes, okay. Let me repeat. I said that we have everything that we need, so I can start right away, yes?",
            "Actually yes, but we will have to excerpt the names. If you can do that automatically. So probably - so - Sh. Maybe say I. Say me if I should excerpt these names and put it to this table. So - so that for each meeting you have the names of the attendees.",
            "If you have time that would be good, but I can also try automatically to do that.",
            "So I began to do that but I didn't finished it. Actually, for example, for PROJECT2 meetings this is the same group of people and for PROJECT3 meetings this is also the same group of people. Probably I will worked it little bit more and say -",
            "Okay so just when finish, just tell me so I can start to work.",
            "As soon as possible.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm waiting for your statement then.",
            "Okay,. Yes, I actually - it was also my plan to finish it as soon as possible and to say it to you, but I didn't finished, so -",
            "Okayy, thank you.",
            "There will be problems - So it seems to be the this PROJECT2 plenary calls are very problematic and probably we will - we will have to exclude all these meetings. This 10 meetings, because there is at least 1 person and probably 2 persons who are objecting from having the data in the corpus, so we should take it the data - I will so - I will also inform you about that.",
            "Okay. Anything else?",
            "No, I guess.",
            "PERSON2, so what is the - what is the of the plan for the data, like you and Aegon was to getting? So do you think, that we should be starting the manual minuting on those data?",
            "We didn't speak with PERSON5 personally yet, So actually what I did I read the same e-mail from PERSON5, So I - I - So we with PERSON5 should now decide if - I haven't seen the data yet, so I don't know how to look at them with eyes to keep the annotators, how - I actually need to look at the data and I didn't - and I didn't see it yet. So I have nothing against giving it to annotators, so - But I should first open the data. Well actually what I can see is that there are quite big textual files. PERSON5, are you there?",
            "Yes, I'm here.",
            "When you looked at the data, didn't you see the agendas there? Or some minutes or something like that? Because they refer to the agenda all the time, but I can't understand if there is something - If there are agendas - they are probably not, yes?",
            "I don't think there are - Minutes for sure there are not, but agendas - maybe there are some short descriptions of each meeting, like -",
            "So if we give this to annotators, it means that -",
            "They will read the entire thing and they will produce the - the minutes.",
            "And produce the minutes. And as I see - as I see this list of many many many ORGANIZATION4 - ORGANIZATION4 TXTs -",
            "Yes, I already specified that there are 9000 and something exactly.",
            "Aha, and how - how long are they actually in terms of, I don't know -",
            "There are different lenghts, like there are 8000 words, 9000 words, 5000 words, 30000words...",
            "So you -",
            "80000 -",

            "So there are different lenghts. Yes, 80000, 8000, 5000... So some of them are quite usable, like the 5000 or 6000 files - word files.",
            "Maybe - we will definitely be not able to annotate all of them. Maybe if you choose a small sub set of shorter meetings, I -",
            "I already said this in the e-mail, PERSON2, did you read the e-mail?",
            "Yes, but maybe not very attentively. I -",
            "Okay, so I already said that we can select the ones that are short enough, Yes. like 8000, 9000 words. And the ones that dialog Yes, the diary. cause we don't need monologues.",
            "But I would -",
            "So I already stated this in the e-mail to - to select this - this - this - this documents, that are -",
            "Yes, this is - this is what I read, but I din't understand if you are able to technically -",
            "Yes, I can - I can do it automatical, because the set pretty much very st. Like I - Properly structured and it's - it's easy to count the number of words in each file automatically. So I can filter the - the shorter ones, the ones up to 1000, the ones up to 8000, whatever. It's not really hard to do it.",
            "Perfect. So then maybe could I ask you to make this to -",
            "Yes, I will create some - some - I can crete the words with some folders, with each file up to - For example folder, which - with 10000, which contains all the - the files up to 10000 words. One 5000, one 7000, and then we can decide which one you use, dependin on the lenght that - that we want.",
            "Yes, and please do it only for English. I suppose that in Cz for Czech it is the - they are just translated.",
            "I don't know that, but yes, I can only for -",
            "They would do the same, this is the parallel corpus.",
            "I don't know, this is the source. This is not the parallel version that for machine translation. So, I'm not sure about -",
            "Yes, but ORGANIZATION4 is just a parallel - ca. Have the idea of parallel texts, so it's - would be logical if the meeting are the same, but translated into other languages.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So let's do it for English.",
            "Yes, sure, of course.",
            "So pleas choose, how many. I don't know, 40? Shorter dialogues - dialogue meetings.",
            "I will produce different versions and then we can decide.",
            "Okay.",
            "But there is also one catch - there is also one extra thing, but somebody has to see inside and somehow remove - So spot the ones that are only monologues. Because there are couple of monologues there -",
            "So this is what you can't do automatically, you c.",
            "No. So somebody has to go there and - but it's - it doesn't take a lot of time I guess, because you just see 1, 2, 3 different and you see it's a - it's a dialogue.",
            "Okay.",
            "If you go down, down, down and can't see different speekers, then you can delete it, cause it's monologue.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I don't think it takes much time.",
            "Yes, yes yes yes. It will not take much time. Perfect. Then let's try to put and see how much meetings we will get before -",
            "Yes. From 9000 and then something? I guess we can come up with some hundreds of good propriets.",
            "Yes, yes, but I mean how many meetings we can anotate before the deadline of the data -",
            "This - this depends on the annotation capacity.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Number of annotators and their capacity.",
            "Yes, well, let see. Hopefully we get something over 30. Okay, this is clear. What next?",
            "PERSON2, I - I also e-mailed about the probable time lenght that we should be looking for, so did you have time to go through the e-mail, maybe?",
            "Proposal submission November 2020. Data release Januarly - January.",
            "Yes, yes. So this is what we do - like ensure from.",
            "Insury for what?",
            "That - that is what we need to ensure for our that we - That - what data we to release. We have to make that ready maybe by the end of this year.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I means what from my side?",
            "No, I just wanted to, like, communicate this to all that this is what the time lenght we are looking for. And suppose - Like we decide that we have now currently 76 - 76 instances of Enlish and 54 instances of Czech. Suppose we are - we are thinking like - maybe we would release 500 or 300 as part for - as part for data sets. So, that exact figure we need to, like, agree on and try to achieve that by the end of this year. That's what.",
            "That is what I cannot promise.",
            "So, what you - what you think would be - would be a possible number that we could reach by December, PERSON2?",
            "I would say that - Yes. I would say that it would not be more than we have now. Because - first of all, some meetings should have to be deleted. Some - so something about 10 hours will definitely be deleted.",
            "And probably we get 10 hours more. But I cannot definitely promise it. So it is possible that we get more, but - Well actually - well I c - Data you mean - Actually, when I look at the duration - This is the duration, so now we have 80 hours of transcribed and minuted minutes. But if we look at that 28 minutes are twice, which means we have about 25 hours more. Actually, we have now 100000. If we consider the same minutes for - If we consider minutes for the same meetings. How do you count it? How should we count it?",
            "Like I can only see point of view to - Like mostly I would count all the instances we have, but I think we need to do a bit of study on what should be the number of instances. Like we would release the training as.",
            "Okay, so, I will - I will - I am writing this to - to the agenda. So you will kind of consider what is the standard n. So how much data is the minimum possible to be released for the shared task.",
            "Yes. Yes, so what I have to do PERSON2, is I will present - I will present the data statistic that we have as far of our share task this year in. And then we can decide that.",
            "You will present, sorry, what?",
            "I will present the shared task statictisc of the summarisation. Shared task that we this year. So far that we can have an idea that should be the minimum number of data instances ww should release.",
            "Yes, maybe also - maybe also focus on dialogue data.",
            "Yeah. For the shared task we have any dialogue data -",
            "I mean - I mean - so whan you use - So speech data. Where you u. Speech manually transcribed data, so how. Because this is very different when you w you - when you work with not speech it's much more available.",
            "Alright. I - I - I - I - understand your concern. So let me do a little review on this and maybe and we will get back to you with -",
            "What is the statistics of the other because it's in speech - So - And also shared task - in general shared data. So then we can, like, decide upon that. So it's an action point on me we do.",
            "Yes, thank you,. I'm writing this down to the agenda, yes? I see the that, but I'm trying to c populate the agenda as much as I can.",
            "Okay. Anythig else we want to discuss today?",
            "I would like to ask PERSON1, is she here? PERSON1, are you there?",
            "Yes, I'm there. You hear me?",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi, hi, hi PERSON2.",
            "I tried to ask the evaluation, have you proceeded?",
            "Yes. So I did that for that, because the manual evaluation needs the alignment. Can we just get a call with - a call with the alignment too?",
            "Yes, this - No, no no no no. This is 2 different tasks. First of all - So the first one is resolved the alignment and this is what I actuall wanted to do with you now. And the second one is using this speeches alignment, but we don't have access to here now. So let's -",
            "Okay.",
            "Let's first walk with the criteria the, I don't know, PERSON5 proposed.",
            "So we have to create 2 evaluative -",
            "Some others understandability. So let's just think about different criteria, that we can use manually and now with the alignment.",
            "Okay. Okay, so I have to do it now without alignment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So untif until we have - we have the result of - the alignment results -",
            "So I think we are running out of the ORGANIZATION2 40 minutes slot.",
            "Okay,. So, should we finish now? Do we have any other -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. PERSON7 - PERSON7 or PERSON3, if you have something to ask or something to add?",
            "No, I'm okay.",
            "No, no, no, thanks.",
            "Okay, wonderful. So then, like, we can today and then tomorrow again?",
            "Okay.",
            "Perfect.",
            "And PERSON3 I will - I will write you when I get a little bit closer to the end of this participants list.",
            "Okay, but if it was hard just tell me and I can do that myself.",
            "Yes. Yes, I will contact you. So I will try to do most what is easy and then - So what - what kind of demands may understand enough the situation and what technical thing I will adress you. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "So, thank you.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you everyone.",

            "Hi.",
            "Hi, I'll be back in a second.",
            "Okay, I think PERSON9 was telling me that he's not joining today and other than that I I think PERSON1 is also not joining today because there's nothing to be handled. In the administrative area. So ha ha there were there was a call last week and some some of us were participating so let's discuss what was what was happening on the call. I don't know if I should wait for PERSON11. He went away. But okay so in in a nutshell, what happen call. We were we were introducing the new representative from the ORGANIZATION8 to our progress so far, right? And there was some introductions, some summarization of of the of the previous work. Nothing important in particular. Like for us. Maybe one important thing was that the PERSON2 was is is going to leave the project. But I think PERSON5 and PERSON9 are still properly in contact with the ORGANIZATION3, is is that right?",
            "Yes, yes, that's correct.",
            "And okay. So so now there are I sort of started is everything going according to plan? Or are there any I don't know any catch?",
            "Well, we prepared the experiment for like 8 months and so far we only have one user. Which is lower number th of users than we would like. And then we had for our run of the experiment, like which which we did on year. So I'm kinda disappointed, but still hoping that the majority of users is still to come. Because tha this was the main contribution of. This was supposed to be the main contribution of ORGANIZATION3. To provide the people. So I would be very disappointed if only a handle handful of them would join.",
            "So do we know where is the problem? Why why there are not providing more people?",
            "No.",
            "Okay. And have you tried asking them?",
            "Huh. Not yet. I want to give them some time, because urr they appear to be quite stressed, but I will write them.",
            "Okay okay okay. So that's probably everything related to PROJECT4, right?",
            "Okay. From PROJECT1, I think PERSON9 is still running his experiments, he want to. His his doing with PERSON4, so that's that. And I think he's on vacation now, so so I think there's no problems with that part. I wanted to actually, I can ask PERSON5, since he's here. But there was some request like how how is our s how is it with our system at at ORGANIZATION2? Right now, the paraphrasing system? Because PERSON12 was asking whether we can move the models to weaker GP or something like that. Like whether we really need the those titans for for these paraphrasing experiments?",
            "I was not yeah I was not included in the spreads so this information is new for me. But I I think PERSON9 set up some batch jobs to paraphrase all the sentences and that it's finished now. And that it didn't interrupt the experiment, because that wasn't there was only the one user. And so far it runs smoothly and quite fast. But well I don't know I don't I don't have any further information so.",
            "Oh okay, I will ask PERSON9. Like the thing is that it is not like we're not in hurry to kill it or or move it, but we should do something about it. Like I don't know maybe dismantle or some. Like they were asking us wha wh until when we are going to use use the ORGANIZATION2 for this. But they are I'll I'll kas PERSON9, so.",
            "Well. This. Another question as to how long we plan to be open with this experiment?",
            "Yeah I think that was the question, right? But we are using it in the PROJECT4 experiments, right?",
            "Yeah yeah, yep. But I meant in PROJECT4, how long we are going to collect the data and allow new users to join?",
            "Well, you don't know right now, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because we are still waiting for the people to actually participate.",
            "Yeah but I'll try to write ORGANIZATION3 to.",
            "Get us some estimate about the number of people and yeah.",
            "Yeah but but till the the question I had in mind is whether it is possible to just move the module to a different machine during the experiment. But that's probably not what we want to do right? Because the.",
            "I mean it will be possible, but I wouldn't recommend that, because.",
            "Yeah, there won't be downtime, right?",
            "That's not the big issue. But we would also alter the environment by doing this. Because some users would do the experiment on faster paraphrases, some would do them on slower paraphrases. We should introduce some noise into the data.",
            "Okay, so I will tell PERSON12 that we we cannot do it right now and we currently don't have even the estimate when the experiment will end. I think that's fine. Like it didn't seem so urgent, more like with with the like thinking about the future, right?",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So so it's all right. Okay so. PERSON11 also again left, but yeah, we can we can move move on to the PROJECT2, right. So hi PERSON10.",
            "Hi.",
            "I I made the note that I still need to remind PERSON6 sending us the information about the people from ORGANIZATION4. PERSON11? Like they were they were mentioning that some people from ORGANIZATION4 are doing similar th. Yeah, okay, so I will ask PERSON6, so he provides us with the contact.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And maybe some details. And then I will message to you, PERSON10.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know. Do you have something you want to discuss today? I think you mentioned that you have something?",
            "And actually I've been reading about direct machine translation and.",
            "With what I found, most papers ascribe directive predictive machine translation, which is trying to predict. The machine translation is trying to predict and warning the target language. And the user oh is human translator, that knows the target language and he corrects the the this when there's a mistake a. But I I don't know exactly how to connect this idea of interactive machine translation yet to to the PROJECT2. However, I'm I wath thinking about an approach that I don't know if you we are using this already with the paraphrasing part of the project. That is to make the back translation of the of the sentence and and make the user select what he wants to avoid I mean we we have the use the back translation to ensure the the the options to the user. So the user can see what's that he doesn't want w he wants constrained in the you know. So but this is the only thing that I I thought about, making this interaction of the translation, but it it I I didn't know because we are considering that the user doesn't understand the the target language, right, so.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I think you've you've made a v a like very good c you've collected a good impression about the interactive machine translation. That is true. The reason why I was pointing that out, was because it was very active research area with phrase-based MT. And I've lost touch with that area since then, so I think it has been also then revived for neural MT. And the the backgr the back end techniques could be interesting for us. Because in interactive machine translation you are essentially exploring the PROJECT2 in some way.",
            "It's I agree just the next word. But what what to do with the with the neural network search could be u in good inspiration for us, what we should do. Obviously we are searching further in the list. And like ensuring that we avoid some words or or include some words. But the techniques could be relevant. The techniques for neural MT. So that's why I was pointing that out. And I think that you probably also got some recent more recent papers on neural MT and that that would be those more important to read. And for the interaction with the back translation, yes, I totally agree. So the we had the call the PROJECT3 call with PERSON3, the new person from ORGANIZATION8 and so on. And there someone it was possibly PERSON13, the ORGANIZATION8 guy, was asking and I was answering what is the interaction of the PROJECT2 module and the rest of the modules. And what you're talking about now is exactly this type of interaction. So I see it as like one more module in the PROJECT4 layout for example. And the you can use the module for of back translation to click on words and indicate I like this, I don't like this. And then there will be this navigation module and that navigation module would accumulate these this preferences. So you would be adding constraints with wherever you wherever it is convenient to to express them for the user. And you would then delete them if you realized that they are bad in this in this module for for the navigation. So that's like the front end of the PROJECT2. But there is also the separate thing, the back end. And they need to be in like developed closely together, so that like the front end specifies what the fr what the back end needs and and supports. But you're you're on perfect track, that's that's very good.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I I will try to read more about interactive machine translation in the in the sense of the the the back end the use, right. So I I I w I read the the idea and thought okay, I don't know if this has some connection. But okay, I will I will read further. But I think there then I'm I think I'm understanding the task now and I will keep looking for some directions on this. Thank you for the explanation PERSON11.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. And and I have administrative question, the embassies. Have you have you checked?",
            "What happened? Oh, I I received an email from PERSON1, is -",
            "PERSON1, we pronounce it PERSON1, so I don't know.",
            "Oh, sorry.",
            "Oh. Her name is PERSON1, actually, so.",
            "It is? PERSON1. It's like Portuguese, so okay, I can pronounce that. But well I I didn't send her the the document yet, because today is a holiday here in LOCATION1, so everything's closed and I don't have the document, so.",
            "Okay, yeah. But the ORGANIZATION1 is is open, right? The.",
            "Oh, sorry, about the ORGANIZATION1. The ORGANIZATION1 is closed.",
            "Yeah so. I'm I'm curious if there is any news on the ORGANIZATION1 in in LOCATION1.",
            "No, they they're they're closed and they don't know when they will open again. So I I created a to keep checking if they they post any new about it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But I'm not I'm not sure when it will happen. I should be there as soon as possible. There's an alternative I was thinking about that. That I don't know exactly, I didn't investigate it enough. But as a person from LOCATION1, I can be around I can go to to to the Czech Republic for twe ninety days. I can be there without a visa, so.",
            "But I don't know if since this is a business trip, I don't know.",
            "This. That's a good question for PERSON1, actually. She should ask in what way do we need you here. I think that it possibly can help our administrative people if you arrive as a tourist. But I'm not certain pers like I'm I'm not quite certain. So is is PERSON1 on the call or not, PERSON8? No, no. So please t please like let her know, that you have this option. So if if I understand correctly, you could just catch the the nearest the soonest airplane and come over, right? In principle, yes.",
            "Yeah I will have to check that, but.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I can enter EUrope without a visa. But.",
            "Because I.",
            "I just don't know how if this is okay tourist.",
            "Yeah, I think that I think that the Czech regulation for COVID now would not let you in.",
            "Oh, yeah. That's that's a problem. I will check this.",
            "So that's that's that's yeah, that's another thing. But anyway, we should investigate because because ther once the embassies are reopened, there will be huge gueues for sure. Like they in the the processing will be stalled. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So PERSON1 should investigate in any case if your arrival as a tourist would be useful or not. If it would be useful, then when the border is open for f like citizens of non-ORGANIZATION7 countries. B and I think it's closed now. So when the border is open, then it would be good if you arrived as a tourist. But I think it's actually more likely that they will say that it's more of the of the correct type of arrival that we need. And in that case, it doesn't make sense to arrive as a t as a tourist.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So but we need to explore the options before you start buying the tickets, obviously, so -",
            "We we need to we need to know what sort of. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. That's a good thing. Yeah, let's let's investigate that and as soon as I.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I can go.",
            "Yeah, great, thank you.",
            "But about the ORGANIZATION1, I I don't know, I. We'll have to wait.",
            "Yeah it's great that you have this watcher that will notify you, right?",
            "Yeah, I hope it works.",
            "Yeah, well so keep checking every n every once in a while.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "So if there is nothing else we want to discuss, like we can still about the PROJECT2, but I think we have a separate meeting on on Thursday or Friday. So.",
            "Can I just have some questions? Regarding the front end? I should I do some work on the front end, or? Not yet?",
            "I think not yet. I have I have to talk to you, because I didn't discuss it yet with you. But so far I'm I'm trying to to to think about the back back end of it. So I I think it's fine. What we have, the TNT.",
            "But maybe we'll have to modify something. I know that you won't be around after October, is it correct?",
            "No, I'll still have some part time. So I'll be able to to some development.",
            "Okay. Yeah, so I will contact you.",
            "And we can discuss. But so far I don't have any any other idea, because it's to what we have so far, it's okay. It's it's it's fine.",
            "My question is and maybe I just didn't understand, was if this will be in the PROJECT4 later also, or it will be separated?",
            "I would like it s for be separated, but.",
            "Okay, yeah, so.",
            "But but we we can discuss this.",
            "Yeah so, the the reason why we talk about PROJECT4 or PROJECT4 experiment is because everybody is now familiar with that after all the preparations. So everybody knows what the modules are, but it's it's just like a point of reference. And since PERSON5 will be remote and not not much in touch with the project starting from mid mid October or something like that, I'm afraid that we cannot we won't have such a skilled person to run another PROJECT4 experiment. With PROJECT2. So that's why it's better if it's not linked strongly and not relying on on PERSON5 too much. So t if if it's separate, it's safer for the project. If we run a user study with PROJECT2, yes, that will be great. But let's not lock ourselves in in presence of PERSON5.",
            "Great, okay. Yeah, so I'll try to to reach you PERSON5 and talk to you wh as soon as I as I have something more specific to discuss.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "But so far what I what I what I saw wa is is okay. Thank you.",
            "Okay, so I I think if that's everything we can probably, yeah yeah, end it here today. So yeah. It was nice hearing you again, so let's see each other next week.",
            "Yeah, see you.",
            "Great.",
            "Yeah, great, thank you. Buh-bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Oh plugin I was able to do that but then he has actually replaced one file of requirement from the program folder and he has placed that somewhere else like out of all the folders. And all the like for the installation the program which he has made he has made that program in the folder of this so. Requirement in the folder of program, so thats why there is there was some problem and even the name of the folder was not correct. In the installations, so the yeah so that was that I tried to fix like I I renamed it so try it to fix it but then there is still a problem so I think we need to talk to PERSON3 about that.",

            "Sorry?",
            "You have the you have that annotation on your system installed?",
            "Not so I did install it but I don't at the moment because I also had some problems and then I changed it and that so the final step is that it doesnt work again.",
            "Oh. So yeah like because PERSON6, hum. Because PERSON6 wanted to see the so. I was wondering if its working in your system.",
            "No.",

            "Its more like a book.",
            "Yeah we have to do some kind of pre processing and you know like the minute start is starting from here. Can you see?",
            "Hum hum.",
            "Yeah okay. So you know like this is the 11th of December 2012 and these are the minutes.",
            "Hum.",
            "If you if you go to the website you can also see the same format.",
            "Hum.",
            "Yeah, this is the minute. Yeah. Its very long very long. And it consists of several sections.",
            "So this is something very very different from that from what we saw. Ye. On the web Thursday, what is that actually.",
            "Is it different I I found I find its same.",
            "Its the same. Why is it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Why is it so long, this is for.",
            "You know the what you saw in the web was.",
            "For all the.",
            "That was only only this portion.",
            "Hum yes okay.",
            "Minute of for the date.",
            "Yes hum.",
            "So yeah. So its very long.",
            "Yes.",
            "And finally like you know I dunno how this will be important to us like you know like vote, so these are all just names.",
            "Not really.",
            "Yeah these are all just names and finally.",
            "We don't want names we want to get get rid of them.",
            "Yeah, but this is part of minutes, so.",
            "Yes.",
            "Programatically is not possible to only the names because its different.",
            "Hum.",
            "And finally for all the minutes is like the sign of its yeah. So this weekend removed so we can. This is not. Certain portions we can remove but this is how the minutes are looking.",
            "Hum yeah.",
            "Okay so the other thing that I will try to do which will not be stripped for work is to split the minutes based on the chatters that are there on the European corpus. And that will take some time you know.",
            "Why is it complicated?",
            "Its complicated because you have to go inside the minutes and then find the exact chatter and then split from.",
            "Is it is it not normal?",
            "I guess that is no chatter in for this particular minute. So its just, reporting from a date.",
            "It is not easier to extract from web?",
            "Yeah.",
            "This already there, so maybe is it not maybe easier to take it not from this pdf but from website?",
            "Oh yeah scraping the that will that will I think will induce further complications because.",
            "PERSON4 told that it is that it was realistic but I cannot estimate it I don't know how to do that.",
            "No its realistic but you know like take care of the meeting ideas and stuff.",
            "Hum.",
            "Okay so then each fragment which so that will be bit we but I think like each of those segments are separated I dunno any marker in that to actually to find to to which meeting or minuting it belongs.",
            "Yes okay if you consider considered more complicated then its up to you.",
            "Yeah but but but I would like to know how do you require the minutes if I can have a sense of this and then I can try.",
            "Have a sense of this. No.",
            "How like how do you want to see the minutes you want to have it aligned with the European corpus.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right so that can be done from here.",
            "Okay.",
            "That can be done from here, just that we have to find the proper markers. And also like like not all the meetings have minutes posted in the ORGANIZATION1.",
            "And then just included.",
            "Yes.",
            "I think this is not question to me because you are people who will use corpus for creating programs. So make it in such a way that you can use it and give it as the data for the shared task.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah what I'm telling you is that its not that we can use corpus for for this purpose because in like in the ORGANIZATION1 corpus there weree some meetings from 96 so like the year 1996 so those minutes are not in the ORGANIZATION1 website.",
            "So what do you propose I didnt get it.",
            "So whatever we have we have to work with that.",
            "Yes yes.",
            "Website, we can only work with those, because those I think I think like the earlier minutes they have like list from the website I could not find those. Like we have minutes from I guess 1999 or 2001 onwards, you want that, yeah.",
            "Aha okay.",
            "Else that we don't have.",
            "Hum hum.",
            "But this is a good amount of data like.",
            "Yes.",
            "Like the number of the number of entire minutes like. Till 2012 is almost near about near about 750.",
            "750?",
            "750 yeah.",
            "Hum hum.",
            "And if you split those up then the number will go up.",
            "Hum.",
            "So the next thing is to the ORGANIZATION1 data set and then like create the minutes according to the fragments they have.",
            "Hum yes.",
            "Yeah, so this is but now the thing is that we have the minutes we. And these are very different from the kind of meetings we have.",
            "Yes this is true but we decided to pause it like that just these are different data their. Or do you think now that doesnt have sense or what?",
            "No no it it completely have sense, these arent even truly minutes like so this is different challenge have.",
            "Yes yes.",
            "In in language anything anything is possible and that is a challenge.",
            "Hum yes.",
            "Okay. Yeah so that is what I have from my side, then yeah it will take some time to figure out which are their and which things are not their. The ORGANIZATION1 congress and then split the files sent read the aligned like transcript aligned minutes.",
            "Hum.",
            "But I think this will be done before we actually release data. So another thing I want to like clarify from PERSON4, this is not our data this is from the ORGANIZATION1 so. We are like there should there should not be any problem if we release it as part of the shared task. That we need to.",
            "Yes but this is a lot of out work within that so. We took it and transformed wherenot its open data.",
            "Yeah yeah I know open data but sometimes like published materials there are many ethical concerns that we are really not. Like I came to know certain things like you know even the newspaper public domain right. So many people do create purpose but ethically you should have to take permission from the newwspapers for.",
            "So you think.",
            "So we so. Yeah because its a published content and then wer are again publishing it as a púart of the shared task, so I dunno like if we have to take or something I'm really not available on the ethics thing. But I know that this thing sometimes gets tricky, so thats what PERSON4 said. Like if you are on a small entity no one is going to look at you, but if you are big then people will come after you.",
            "Hum.",
            "So I think like.",
            "You think what.",
            "I think PERSON4 session with PERSON4 would be the best to comment on this like. Eventually if we like are sharing this data which we from the ORGANIZATION1 side, so we are republlishing the same thing right. So we should be on the same that okay it is okay to go ahead.",
            "So what do you propose, that I should PERSON4 or make a session with PERSON4 about.",
            "Yes you can ask yeah I just want PERSON4 to.",
            "Okay. Hum. Oh well lets do that.",
            "Okay so what else we are going to discuss. So I see PERSON1 you have sent us the minutes to right?",
            "Yes.",
            "This is action point on, yeah this is an action. Okay. The thing is like we need to really know get to lost PERSON3 to understand that why which was working sometime back why its not working now.",
            "Did you write. You already contacted him.",
            "Yes.",
            "He will answer.",
            "He might be available next week yeah. This is a minor problem guess.",
            "Yes yes I also think so yes I also think so. I hope it is.",
            "Yes. Okay. So what else, anything else we want to talk?",
            "Maybe not I don't have anything else, its raining strongly.",
            "Hi, so I'm looking to this minutes that PERSON1 just sent us.",
            "Hum.",
            "So who is using bullets again, we already agreed not to use bullets anymore.",
            "Which bullets.",
            "In one of the five minutes bullets.",
            "No it should be one of the old annotations.",
            "Okay, and I see many many. Like not summaries not real summaries at all.",
            "This is not these are not summarized they are minutes, minutes are never fluent. They actually cannot be fluent.",
            "Oh okay. But the high quality ones are the ones that fluent anyway not problem, so for the experimentation just this bullet should be removed than the in minutes.",
            "In which minutes did you say, in which number.",
            "Minutes 0 3 0 3.",
            "0 3. They just should I change it or does it.",
            "Yes you should change it to dashes.",
            "Okay. And actually just a ffor not minutes from meetings are never can never be fluent can never as a text this are not minutes in this way so if you read any instructions how to make minutes how to create minutes which are the instruction that have been written at the beginning of the 20th century. Minutes are kind of forbidden to be readen as text. Because they should be because this is not obvious then so minutes are kind of ideas separated but not a fluent text.",
            "It don't have to be like that actually.",
            "I just this is question of terminology of course what can we what do we say are minutes what do we say are summaries summaries the saem as minutes and so on. But anyway I don't think I don't agree with you in the opint that good mintes are fgluent.",
            "Good minutes are fluent, you don't agree with that?",
            "Definitely I do not agree with that, so so.",
            "Oh really?",
            "Good good newspapers summaries may be fluent this I I could agree with that but that meetings meetings minutes should not be fluent and totally sure.",
            "Oh you are sure, but what about the late that I'm just reviewing days.",
            "The should doesnt say that well maybe we differently understand the word fluent. This is.",
            "Fluent in the sense that continues sense that continues sentences. Like the one that I produced.",
            "Minute 4 is mine is my output and its fluent in the sense that the senses go one after each other. And that is how the objective of summaries also extracted summarization the so the objective is to produce summaries that are fluent and readable and that is also very popular criteria for evaluationg the summaries for.",
            "What did you read?",
            "What did I read?",
            "Yeah because I alsor ead a lot of books on that topic and I never found that it should look like a text with references. Actually I I I'm really very unsure about anaphoric references in the minutes because they make rather MS then a good idea. So when you have they in minutes it rather disturbs.",
            "Okay.",
            "So what did you read?",
            "I read the literature PERSON1.",
            "Which one?",
            "All the literature reviewing, its already in the clusterr.",
            "But, this is about summaries not about minutes.",
            "Summary and the mintues are the same.",
            "No, its not the same, so actually the summary is much broader, summary everything summarized. You can summarize newspaper article you can summarize the book you can summarize.",
            "Yes. And we are going to summarized meeting that are minutes.",
            "No, minutes from meetings are not summaries from books, and they have.",
            "Summaries from meetings from meeting transcript.",
            "It doesnt matter if its if it is summary from meeting transcript or meeting as a recording, but anyway I think that meeting is no so its a different entity so its not a text its not fluent its as is if its made from different authors it is it has different opinions and it also might have different structure and if you are so. When I prepared the paper about how many that very old I dunno two years ago, that you didnt want to participate in. I also read som epopular information not about summaries as a but meetings from minutes that are created for people who use that. So this is actually maybe different aspect of looking on that, but the this is true so people who are making minutes from meetings do not make it fluent in the sense you say its just the fact. So you.",
            "Okay okay okay.",
            "Maybe if you if you want to think about it further look at literature i refer there.",
            "No I don't thinkits relevant I think literature that is relevant is the one that we are reviewing now. Or the literature we are preparing.",
            "No if you want to make a product that will help pepole to make theri minutes and people who make their minutes do not make it fluent never. So why we should create fluent pieces of text if we are trying to help people to create their minutes and these people never make it fluent just this is same like so kind of misunderstanding between us. Because what you you get you take a task from their feed of summarization and I kind of take a task from the point of view of the final product. So I.",
            "Okay sure.",
            "So this is just different aspects of none thing and in this point they kind of meet and partly controversional. So I understand how you come to this fluency, its really important to have it in summaries, but it is onreachable there is not good to have it in minutes.",
            "Good I don't know anyway okay so you have your own work and literature that you are basedc on so okay you can go on that way. I'm usually used to to to the literature that is the research literature of this domain so not problem.",
            "This is not a search literature on this domain, this is literature of how engine summarizes. So this is the so you're you are based on research literature of on of summarization.",
            "No its research literature about minutes of meetings so if you want you can check the titles of the papers. They are specificalyl refering to the for example extrafcted summarization of the.",
            "Really miss a lot big piece of information. I will i will control it I will.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "And so its quite possible why not.",
            "Okay then so maybe we meet on Monday?",
            "Hum. On Monday. Well I hope I can it may have been that something happens. But probably not.",
            "Yeah many things can happen. So lets meet on Monday and.",
            "Yes.",
            "And hope that PERSON3 time on Monday and we really fix this issue really quick.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay then take care guys also the this protocol human evaluation protocol for minuting is changed. And the so yes probably PERSON5 has edit some things there.",
            "Yes she spoke a lot about it during out meetings here.",
            "Yes so just the fluency so because the way I created this is with my setup and mine but since we have about it I mean this is also supposed to be changed. Bnecause I see no reason for having fluency at this point, so that was okay the topicality okay for sure its okay.",
            "I would like to interrupt you that we have not analyzed this yet, its just that from the literature we have all the measures which we need to.",
            "Yes yes but from this dicussion with PERSON1 now I'm the fluency score that I put here initially was with my own way of thinking based on the literature but since PERSON1 fluency is not supposed stay there, then we have to kind of reflect this change also in this document. We don't we cannot put it there because it is obvious that fluency in the samples so.",
            "Yeah but this paper is our kind of final product not ready yet and now we are evaluating not basing on this document, we are evaluating all possible measures.",
            "Yes sure sure yes.",
            "And we will probably change make changes in the document according on on.",
            "Yes this is what I'm saying that we will may need to to to reflect it here as well and this is what I'm.",
            "Yeah definitely yes of course.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay I'll see you on Monday yes?",
            "Yeah take care bye bye.",
            "You too you too. Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Okay.",
            "We want to deside to discuss together with you. And it it would be better not even to the.",
            "Could you.",
            "Please PERSON10, Could you open the agenda. You can either in Hangouts, Or in the invitation for the call.",
            "Okay. Let me open. I'm I'm there.",
            "Fine. So I wanted to discuss at least two things today. And this these are evaluations and preparation for evaluation. And shared task and some shared task imitation we discuss with PERSON6 today. And I'm I'm I want to propose for this week. If we could do that.",
            "I can't see you in the agenda.",
            "Is it why actually.",
            "I actually I ee have logged in from the phone, I'm I'm there on the agenda.",
            "Okay.",
            "Through phone. I don't know, yeah. So.",
            "Doesn't doesn't matter, Just important that you see that.",
            "Yeah, I I am ever unseen that.",
            "Perfect. Perfect. Well I want to make clear about the evaluation rules. Who is now working on anything concern evaluation and evaluation measures? Do you PERSON10 do you do something in that direction?",
            "Yes. I do have something, PERSON1. But it's it's not ready yet. So just to show you in so whatever I have maybe those that I can show you, So that you get to know what exactly the direction in moving on.",
            "Do you work on are you working on automatic measure. Or manual?",
            "Yes, automatic.",
            "Mm-hmm, yes. So you are experimenting with automatic measures.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "And so.",
            "But I eventually you gave me similarity an automatic measure both. But then when I read lots of papers. And when I was experiment. I got to knew that why do you told me to for similarity of measures, So. Evaluation also has a pint of similarity into it.",
            "And now I could make sence whether why did it said me to. I actually experiment with similarity of.",
            "Yes.",
            "So it has a great in evaluation.",
            "Okay.",
            "Making an automaticly trick.",
            "Making an automaticly magic, Okay. That's fine. So so yeah now it's clear, And Cetanko do you also work on evaluation measures?",
            "Yes, PERSON1. I was going through the existing measures, So I think I can come up with something on the automatic measures. Maybe by maybe by end of this month?",
            "So you are. You are experimenting on automatic measures too, And you're going to come up bases of this survave you are doing now. Yes?",
            "Yes. Yes, I can come up with some qualitative and quantitative surveys of all these measures work on our data. Trained on some trained on someone like be.",
            "Okay. So we have two people working on automatic measures. And there is so we are kind of planed to have something to the end of factor to the end of October. From PERSON10 and from.",
            "And may ask PERSON5 you prepared that evaluation protocol proposal. Something like a month ago do you consider that to be kind of enough material to make a manual evaluation?",
            "Material.",
            "So are you able at the moment based on what you know about that make kind of evaluation. I I to evaluated to evaluate meet minutes.",
            "Evaluate minutes? How can I evaluate minutes.",
            "This is what I ask. I so so okay, I will ask you other way, Do you work on evaluation somehow on evaluation.",
            "No.",
            "Preparing. No but you created the document about how one put prepare manual evaluation measure. Do you understand that correctly?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes. So if we want to make a manual measurement, We need to do what?",
            "You need to get people annotators, I don't know. They will red they will read the the minutes the minutes, They will also read generated minutes, The minutes that are generated by automatic methods or technics or models. And there will put some scores that I suggest.",
            "Yes, But you suggested it generally, So there should.",
            "Yes.",
            "So it is still needed as we still need. One more step to prepare directly I don't know guidelines for aa.",
            "Evaluation how to do that. Yes?",
            "And to.",
            "Yes.",
            "We end to be able to compute somehow from there measure from their stars. They give to two minutes. To come up with some number with some evaluation. Or.",
            "Yes, so and I think PERSON6 shared that paper which he wants to be like a mimic of our manual evaluation. I think we can use, That particulary strategy to formulate our manually evaluation.",
            "Oh, could you share the paper in agenda, please?",
            "It it is I I have log phone and I don't know.",
            "Yes, sorrry. Sorry, I know. I know, later.",
            "It does in the email, Yeah, I can. Later I can in the email with attachement PERSON6 has attached that paper. If is search on in your email attachement paper,",
            "Attachment what?",
            "Ment. Yeah in your email box just to search attachement paper on you see the email via PERSON6.",
            "I didn't understand the word. Attachment.",
            "Attachment. I will write in the in the chat.",
            "Attachment paper. That is the key word.",
            "So maybe I think using this strategy, we can also use the with PERSON5 has suggested.",
            "Performing the manual guidelines.",
            "Yes, The question is who will do that. Yeah, so a paper.",
            "Normally annotators.",
            "No, I mean, Not the judgment, But procedure.",
            "Guidelines. Yeah.",
            "Guidelines how to compute this call then.",
            "Computers. Are you serious is just the formula, You get the numbers. And you computed.",
            "Okay, I did. So this is this is what attend now that's why I ask.",
            "It's just a computation that you doing.",
            "Yes, okay. Umhm.",
            "PERSON1, Are you like will it it's not a problem.",
            "The hard task the the task time consuming task is for the evaluators. To read the two references the two minutes reference one and.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "Automatic generated one. And to put the scores that is the time.",
            "Okay.",
            "Is just a formula that is done.",
            "Yes, yes. I understand. Okay, mainly ask you PERSON10 this the to create these guidelines.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, I will do that, I know.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So maybe I w I need your help with that with.",
            "Yes, definitely.",
            "So I yeah.",
            "Yes, You can ask me anything at any stage.",
            "Just just that to move forward. Some kind.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So so just now we spoke about the share task. And evalution of the task of tasks of the shared task. So I'm kind of clear that we are waiting to the end of month with two automatic measures. And the next week with manual guidelines so we wanted to propose with PERSON6 kind of shared task imitation fort this weeek. But as I can see now I'm not sure, So can you see the shared task imitation? We have so we have repropose to make to take one meeting for now. For example, one that have that already has several meetin several minutes by a different annotati annotators, And then PERSON10 and maybe PERSON2 will create minutes manually. But in way like they expect their they expect their programs will generate later. And PERSON5, PERSON4 and probably PERSON10 will afterwards evaluate the outcome of the of these meetings. But maybe we can do each other next week. Because we will have these typs manual evaluation. So to try this evaluation first let's create them. And then let's try there. So at the moment we don't have it yet. So probably first we make this manual evaluation via PERSON10. And then we will try this. Kind of dry run.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Let's let's postpone it to the next week. I think. This is what I want to do. And one more think is about the tasks included into the shared task. For the main and the most complicated task of created summarize we have. Subjective and not prepared yet evaluation measures. So I expect give in to the shared tasks also tend of more clear task, More easy task. This is and this would be the one that PERSON10 had for had for the similarity for this distinguishing minutes for the same meeting, And from minutes from different meetings. And this is what PERSON4 formulated as task A and task B. She has she also create defined at the at the that todays agenda. So probably for these for these two first tasks task A and test task B it woul they evaluation is definitely much easier, Because we already know this minutes of this minutes if to these meet minutes out this meetings. And or or not, So it is just just includ it into the shared tasks this is just that.",
            "I did not understand, PERSON1 could you repeat it? What what we have to do for tasking does be?",
            "Included into the shared task, Because the evaluation for task A and task B is kind of much more easy and almost. This is.",
            "Haven't this is what we have for granted. We know if yes or no.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Yeah. So that's why tasks should be also definitely included. This is what I.",
            "So this it is kind of all from my side. For today. PERSON4 wanted to discuss from proposal.",
            "Yes, So discuss a proposal so I guess you all of excess to that shared task. I can this? Proposal shared task.",
            "Yeah, I have seen that.",
            "Yeah, could be? So are we all there? Hallo?",
            "I have it open.",
            "Okay. But about PERSON5 and PERSON10?",
            "Yeah, but the agenda right?",
            "No, In the agenda you have the work proposal under the shared task, And you can click on it and open another document. Shared task for content.",
            "Okay,.",
            "So I think it would be.",
            "In the shared task imitation are proposal? Yeah, I opened it. And there.",
            "So there?",
            "Haloo, PERSON5, are you here?",
            "Probably not.",
            "But I can see.",
            "Is there.",
            "Okay, so could you move to the? In the in the doc?",
            "Okay, so we have the in their speech deadline in in November. Before this we have to clear definiton afford data in the task. So if we have for that task task A, B and C of which the data preparation work task we used going on. The data in GitHub, plus in some format that we.",
            "Sorry, PERSON4 could you maybe change some your audio settings, So get closer to the computer so it's very noisy now.",
            "Is it is it okay, now?",
            "Yes, maybe if you speak little bit slower. It should be better.",
            "Okay. Okay. So if you the pas point we have the in their speech deadline on November 2020.",
            "So I come up with a really definition of our shared task. We have to come up with a really set of data for all the three task that we are going to propose. So moving on to point 2, So we maybe to prepare data for each of task A, B and C of which tasks data ongoing. So we agree that the data would be in the GitHub as in the server? In some format that is okay? The mix tip is to anonymise the data.",
            "Should we finished the anonymisation before November before the the before the deadline?",
            "I I don't think so because anonymisation would be required when we release the trial data.",
            "Aha okay.",
            "We about the required before November.",
            "Is that we need to have ORGANIZATION1 on the data statistics. Which like would be updated confidently when we push thing in the in the server. I think PERSON1 you always ha you already have that, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, you can put that link in over here?",
            "Okay. So I'm little bit afraid of this link, So because this is my only and very very informative table. So please take you not to.",
            "Oh good, Don't share the ORGANIZATION3, Please share the common version. Okay.",
            "So what doesn't mean aha.",
            "So don't share.",
            "Only give the view acces to.",
            "Or maybe that comment access I can comment.",
            "I comment just.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. So another reporting thing so I'm I will just right here. And okay, so PERSON1 you are wonderful. Okay the 40 news that how much data we target for each task. This is important to decide.",
            "Yes, this is important to decide, and also from the point of in in process, yes? How many persents have worked. So I think we cannot afford 80 10 10. Yes? As 80 percent to 10 of training. And ten to developmentent and 10 to test. Yes? So we don't.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "Have to much data.",
            "Yes. But we have late, Maybe in the next meeting tomorrow. PERSON1, you can present. And then we can resay that how much we target. And.",
            "Yes.",
            "How much we should by maybe November.",
            "And of course and of course we can have much more data. Well like task is excepted and then suppose we have looking the task something. Generally, Which have more data. But in the proposal are acceptable formal data should so there send thing that okay this is among the data for the shared task. Because if we can if we have very less data, We made problem that this is not at all machine learning set up.",
            "So the amount of data what like how much we have. And how much we need to target. So make this decision tommorrow.",
            "My ask please what is target? In this context?",
            "I can you repeat?",
            "What do you mean by target?",
            "Target means like supposed you have now we 100 minutes. Okay.",
            "So we have 100 instances.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How many instances we want to before the proposal. So suppose we want 200. So. That means 100 more minutes needs to be.",
            "How.",
            "How how do you mean we want to achieve. So we have some number and used we should clame that we are going to have more before. Before the beginning of the.",
            "Yeah, yes. That we need to agree the.",
            "Ahaaa.",
            "That we need this this amount of instances. So the thing that PERSON5 pointed out, So maybe the meetings are very long we have much more data. But the machine learning the thing that is the instances, So that we need to be sure about. And then I don't know if sleeping would be a good idea. So maybe tomorrow we will discuss on this. About the data.",
            "Yes, we can discuss but the question. So the problem is that everybody of us knows what we know, And we so PERSON5 thinks that there should be devided, You and PERSON10 think that they should not be divided. I can have no idea, Because well, I also think that they kind of one hole, And it is very huge to divide them from the point of -",
            "Right. so late.",
            "But so I do not expect any know how we would decided.",
            "So I but maybe we need brainstorm on this. And let you like that in the. So we can go there way. And, we could be asked all participant that you were free to training model on big data big big corpus. And then late to some find data and finally this. For that we will this thing on to the participants. How intelligently they do this, But for for sure that how much data at next how much we can have before November. Or if that tasks give how much we can have January or February.",
            "Well, This is one more thing I wanted to decide with you, Discussed with you. Bet this is kind of a new idea. And maybe personal. And maybe maybe it has no sense. But when I looked at our meetings. We also discussed that with PERSON5 when you. But now I realized that i realized it is more intensive way. That the meetings we have as an input data. Are not very good from the point of view, Of final first of all, And for the experiments se on the second on on the other hand. So our meetings are of our project meetings are kind of most spontaneous more. And minutes are also spontaneous. And our ideal enduser is are business companies that have much more structure structure meetings. This is one thing. And another thing is. So so maybe taken this. It has some sense to look at open the at so some meetings that are in totally opened excess. Like your ORGANIZATION2. But I don't know where to look at it, Who - if if I find something good if we have time. So this is I'm I'm just really think that they are in insufficient from because they are very spontaneous. And that's why they are getting much. So they are getting the task more complicated. So maybe if our data were more structured, It would be easier to work with them. So should.",
            "Ooo, okay.",
            "Maybe, maybe I should look at other at some in English, at some ORGANIZATION2, Maybe not ORGANIZATION2 maybe native ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Yes. PERSON1 this sounds like a good proposal. But that thing is I would also ask you that whenever you take help of external meetings. You need to have the permission from the respective authority to use that as a.",
            "But ORGANIZATION2 is all open, Isn't it?",
            "Yes, Okay. So what you what do you think. Back like that kind of late maybe we not release that data from our link. Participants to big the data from their sight and. But yeah,, so I think you need to. You need to double check this thing, Before we use any externally meeting, As data set.",
            "And if I take something what is open you need too? Is it do we also need to get. What?",
            "I'm not really sure about this opened things, So maybe you need to check. I'm not sure.",
            "Also.",
            "What is the point to use ORGANIZATION2 data text? I didn't get the point.",
            "Because I begin to dislike our meetings. They are too spontaneous. And maybe if if there is could be something could be easily taken, You make tip.",
            "Yes, but I mean, What's the point? I to put them together with other source what to to completely get rid of our data. And to use other data.",
            "No, no, no. No not to get rid. But to add them to all data.",
            "To mix them together.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But do you think? I think that ORGANIZATION2 data aren't only task without minutes. Like have minutes?",
            "Well.",
            "I'm not sure they have minutes.",
            "I prepare, I don't know. Yeah, I have lot of annotators, I can ask them to prepare.",
            "Oah, okay. So you mean to yes, sure. You use annotators instead of annotating our own recordings to annotate yes. Already available transkripts.",
            "I I I can.",
            "This is.",
            "Look at at at least we could have a little bit also little bit other the the main. And maybe.",
            "Yes. Sure.",
            "I think I also think it's a good idea.",
            "Because yes, our data just one type of meetings. It's not.",
            "And did you did anybody real look at it, Could anybody give me the link?",
            "ORGANIZATION2?",
            "I will find it.",
            "ORGANIZATION2 corpus.",
            "Yeah, ORGANIZATION2. I didn't some.",
            "Aren't there transkripts of this all the transkripts and this. This data is for lots of languages, right?",
            "Yes, but.",
            "ORGANIZATION2.",
            "So I don't need / parallel corpus, So I just want to find some meetings. Okay. I will that if. We take some time.",
            "So so we look in to this external meetings. And maybe bit. And maybe we can discuss tomorrow. After having a fast over the European meetings.",
            "Okay? We move to the next point, So for the ethic control PERSON1 you are taking the leave, right?",
            "Well I do, But not for in kind of professional in that.",
            "Yeah. Okay, like I I have gone to your. I I give will be enough. So we have just think through the paragraph that we have taken due permission from all the participants in the meetings. To take there ASRs and the annotator data as release it as part of the shared task.",
            "Did you did you look at the forms?",
            "Yes. Yes, I did.",
            "So you mean you mean to include the paragraph where?",
            "In the shared task we have to like have a paragraph over it takes control. But how are we getting this this?",
            "Could you could you at together?",
            "I didn't get you, PERSON1?",
            "Could we look at it together. Please. I will send you the link.",
            "Yeah, of course, Of course. So maybe PERSON1 this the external things tomorrow? Let we fast discuss that what general component.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So this we discuss mabye the next day, I just put a note. So moving on the other thing that should be a part of the proposal is how to ensure that we have a good quality data. So I don't know about like internal data. Or something, But what do you suggest? That we should ensure that the quality of data that's we have annotative are okay to like used by the community.",
            "So I don't think inter-annotator agreement helps in this case.",
            "Probably.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Only to compare transcripts, But I actually didn't give parallel data, To different people, Because in well just not to those -",
            "I agree. It would be to something to this. And if we have very if we want to do that.",
            "Yes.",
            "But what. So let us also put this in our thinking plan to think of this and.",
            "Well, I think that's something that co something can grow from evaluations. So. When we make this dry shared task dry run next week. And everybody of us almost of us will evaluate handmade. And kind of automatically created minutes. We will also come to some evaluation.",
            "Right, to thinks.",
            "Why the shared tasks okay.",
            "Okay, wonderful. Okay. So. The the organization of the data for the shared tasks. So we already know that how the data is no organized within the server. So I would like to have a schematic diagram of that. That should go with the proposal, And also like to have it on our GitHub page. So it's better that lives if someone how a just understand that how the data is organized.",
            "So basically we have the manually transcript. And the minutes annotative by annotator A and B. Right? PERSON1?",
            "Yes, I would just I'm just looking for just a moment, Can you f can you see what I'm sharing?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "I can.",
            "So now I'm this structure in such a way that are the names they aren't include too many too long names. And now it now just named so the folder PROJECT1. Then no just we give with PROJECT1 minuting then PROJECT1 minuting corpus english with then english with have PROJECT1 internal meetings. And then we have automatic folder for example search. And within search we have the date. And within the date we have different annotators. Annotator 1, 2, 6 and 7. And within each annotator folder we have transkript created and minutes created. And this are this so this meeting we have we have four different annotator annotations five for different people. And in general folder we have the recording. And that automatic transcript and original minutes. This is the ideal structure of the folder. And it will be partially transport with the same names to the GitHub. But we GitHub we will not have recording and formulate has no sence to include automatic structure construction. I so I.",
            "So what is the minutes?",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Yes, so so PERSON1 do you think if that is we should do that originally minutes as a part of the task, I don't know where it does it feels.",
            "No, no this a little bit with PERSON6 very very so. I think it should be included in it GitHub, Because this is help.",
            "Yeah, yeah, Including the GitHub, I'm talking only about the shared task data. So where does it files?",
            "I don't know. I let me think. So the only problem why maybe not to included is that it is not the systematical. So this is actually on you to decide if to include something that is not available for each meeting.",
            "Yeah. So I don't think that should be included.",
            "Then do not included.",
            "Because all the meeting instances should have the exactly of data.",
            "Do you want to release as a for the participants.",
            "Yes,",
            "Any instance.",
            "So the do not included.",
            "Yeah. So we keep those. But maybe the separate shared task data we include those.",
            "What is the?",
            "Yeah, we are saying, that we don't include the original minutes in the shared tasks data.",
            "The original minutes?",
            "Yes, that the word documents that will created by PERSON6 during the meeting. Not those by annotator but those original.",
            "Yes, we should include we should give the participants the final once the the good once.",
            "What is better. Yeah, that's okay.",
            "So my proposal would be if we have the original minutes it should be for each meeting more some meetings some meetings there.",
            "Then.",
            "I don't think, that that would be.",
            "Yes. PERSON4 don't include it. It's okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. The next point is to how are datas. But we need not to discuss it right now. Once we have the final detail statistics. Just before meeting the proposal. We should come up with the train trial validation. So I it need not to be like finally done before the some mission of the proposal by an that okay. So this much amount of data shou we should release we would the trial data, And then after some maybe one month, we would release the our training data. And after some days for the experiment that they strongly release the validation data of where the participants tested their models. And when they submit their models, We would evaluate them on this datas. So this data will not be released to the participants.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Okay. Was included the definitions of what we mean by this each of them? Is that okay, PERSON1?",
            "Yes. We already have it somewhere, Don't we have somewhere already? This table with this? I think we with PERSON6 we already created this table.",
            "With distribution?",
            "Just a moment, I will look for that. Yes, here. I I will copy path the develop. And in agenda.",
            "Okay.",
            "This is validation.",
            "Right.",
            "Yes?",
            "Yes.",
            "Does it correspond?",
            "Okay. Wonderful. So we are clear on this.",
            "Now next Thursday important part that I already are discussed like the manually evaluation. So one is one one idea is to use what PERSON5 propose for the manually re using the skill and. So actual only that we use that for this kind of evaluation the subjectivity would be higher. So, maybe late. While we do the dry run for the shared task, Thinks will get more on this manually evaluation set up.",
            "Oh, yes. So this is I think that we should definitely try this. And as soon as possible, Because we already have some data. So we. I mean we you PERSON10 and PERSON5 first of all. Maybe also we will apply this PERSON5's propose PERSON5's original proposal. And what PERSON10 will do out of that. And maybe may so maybe everybody of us will you somehow changed, But we should try to apply this evaluation next week for a chosen meeting, And -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Get some result. And what is most important more important, Not just resulted some comments that that does it work what other problems what are what is easy, What is not clear at all. So we should try it themselves our next week it was.",
            "Right, right, right. Okay. So that mixes the manually evaluation protocol that PERSON6 sh is specifically pushing forward about the manually evaluation. What the our the would do. So for this we need a bit a much more clarity that what is the output from the PERSON3's tool. And the how does it correspond to all manually evaluative school. So.",
            "That we need think about, I don't know.",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm not this.",
            "The idea of PERSON3's I if also could. So we can also try it even without have in his technical outputs. So lets try to.",
            "So PERSON1 can you just send me the technical data output of from PERSON3's tool, So that I can do an analysis.",
            "This is what we discussed already, I don't have it.",
            "Ou.",
            "So I it because look together at that, But at from that meet, So I don't have it in emails.",
            "Okay, okay. So I told you ha you said once it that you had late who of the meetings where.",
            "Yes, but not me, He has.",
            "Ohoo, Okay, okay. I. Understand. Okay. And so okay, We need a bit more clarity on this. On the PERSON3's tool, So we for PERSON7, For this.",
            "The next one is the automatic evaluation, So for the evaluation part it's better than we and automatic. So we have now the with just evaluations tender for any kind of sumarization. But it is lexicon is no semantic. So we should try with some semantic matrix, That I am looking into currently. And maybe yes as I say I can come up with something by the end of this month. And how do they on our data. So I really this, And we can discuss that witch we can use. Or which we can visit.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "We can discuss.",
            "This is what you and PERSON10 is now working on independently.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Wonderful so maybe are named against it.",
            "Okay. Wonderful. And there are some responsibilities that that I would like to like forward, Like what should be the submission platform forwarding with the participants with the support groups did a really proposals participaly to the comunity. And hiring somebody which I which I'm like really pushing, Because to to the shared task we need someone who has background.",
            "So.",
            "We. Yes, so we and PERSON6 we have some people who are community, But most of them they say they don't have time. Because I understand that there really similar people in the community. And they want be interested in this. So we need to for some like some researcher started and they maybe interested in our shared task. So having up people having a person who has a background in summarization is especially in speech would be great for our for our proposal. As well as the participants to the to the to the shared task.",
            "Did you speak to?",
            "Hello, yeah?",
            "Did you did you s did you try?",
            "Yes, yes. I know.",
            "She is super busy.",
            "Super bu.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's a pitty.",
            "She is super -",
            "She is very nice person.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's super busy. We her.",
            "We resound several automatical.",
            "I just know and nobody else.",
            "Yeah, they are they are very similar. So I would expect that we to someone who is.",
            "And a final thing is the system runs from our group. So I think like it was like mentioned that maybe we can have three or four system runs from our. And we need to ensure that we have some system run for from. And what else?",
            "Maybe some Czech universities? Especially Brno yeah.",
            "Um-hum. Do we release Czech data?",
            "Can you repeat PERSON1?",
            "Do we release Czech data? So when we speak about data, Do we mean.",
            "Yes, this is one so do we do only English do we include Czech data in our shared task.",
            "So actually, Because I personally would propose to include Czech data into the shared task, Because they are better. The the data quality of the Czech data included annotations. But not only annotations but also the meeting themselves have better quality.",
            "Mm-hmm, okay. So I also agree that we should be.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Okay. So this are the major points that I wanted to highlight. And this would be sufficient to prepare our shared task proposal. But we may come up with something else. So that these late I'm collaborating with and PERSON9 to the shared task proposal, But we that.",
            "We have to be sure that all these points, And then take them tool more clearly.",
            "Okay. So that's it from my end.",
            "Thank you. Well I think I haven't my tasks clear. At least.",
            "Okay, so. Anything else we want to discuss to then?",
            "PERSON1 what is the status of your? How many persons do you have as collaborators as annotators?",
            "Well really not so many, So officially I have about 20 but in reality about 5 for are working. And 2 of them are working on Czech.",
            "Okay, And what is the the the rate at which they work? They produce like process one week one minute one meeting or.",
            "Yes, probably. So so it's differently. It depends on their season, So sometimes when they were corona time in the I don't know in April they gave more. And then so now I receive very hard to say. Because when sometimes some of these very active, And he can send me up to nine meetings during one week. So sometimes 2 meetings in day. And then this same person is much slower. And he sends me one meeting a month. And it depends it's really sl depends on how much time he he has for doing that.",
            "Okay. Yes, because.",
            "Can not can not predict at all. So now my best annotator left. And another very good annotator kind of begun to be very slow, I don't know why. So now it's not the best period for receiving the new data. But so as you can see from that time as I gave so from the last week. When I prepare basic samples for you. And it. It was 100 3 now ooh meetings. Now I have 108 for Czech. So actually received only five meetings spoke Czech. And maybe 3 meeting no for Czech, 5 meetings for English non that time. And 3 meetings for Czech.",
            "Okay, Because that idea that proposed like gathering European or rather meeting Parliament rather.",
            "Yeah, we don't have type for that, yeah.",
            "They don't have minutes, You were only trasncripts. I think that's a very good idea. And use annotators to to the minutes. I think it's very good idea, Because have almost said like it's more than one year that I have been saying that our old recordings are not really very recordings.",
            "They are re in terms of. And they come with this this problems we have the the kind of.",
            "Yeah. Yes. There is.",
            "Our data would of and have we produce the meet the minutes of these other transcript that are very nicely. Available. It will it could be very good idea. I think to have more data better data, Because our data are are not just.",
            "The problem.",
            "Kind of quality but there is small, very.",
            "Yes.",
            "So.",
            "There are there are very very long everyone, The meetings also long. I don't know what I will come to you after we finish our call now, And maybe we could look at it to data.",
            "What what minutes are long, Our minutes, Or?",
            "Not minutes. Not minutes meetings.",
            "Meetings ours or European?",
            "ORGANIZATION2.",
            "There so very long. Yes? Okay.",
            "No everything what I saw all ORGANIZATION2 meetings are very long, So they hours long.",
            "One meeting is 8 hours.",
            "Not because they have the full day.",
            "Yes, yes. I understand. One day of a meeting, yes. Yes, sure. So okay.",

            "It seems that my microphone was turned off so.",
            "Yes. So now it works.",
            "Yeah, okay. Hi to everyone.",
            "Yeah, so. It's great to see you.",
            "It's great to see you again.",
            "Yeah. And I'm also delighted that the connection actually works,, a reasonably well,, so because you know. So I've pinked PERSON6 and,, before he connects as well, I'll,, just mention again, that I'm recording the sound of this meeting on another machine. So the meeting can later serve as another item in our collection of,, of meeting minutes. And,, I would like to,, thank everybody for joining. And and I'm I'm happy that we have this. I call it the workshop. But it's a really a preparatory and welcome meeting. But later on. I think that it'll, it will be inevitable that we will have such meetings. Not too often,, but it's important,, to have the team working,, together. And ', the the purpose of this first meeting,, is to get to know each other and,, the explain to all others what we can expect from every member of the team. Like, what is,, their role, and what they already know. So,, I would like to thank to PERSON9,, for putting together the little agenda. I've put their,, the way I see your roles. So if,, you can quickly look at the,, in the document and correct for yourself if I'm wrong with some of the assumptions on on your roles. Then,, that will be great. And if you agree, then,, that's - It would be best if you, for each of you, what what say for yourself,,, of where you fit. And like if you would read my words, and and comment on that, and and,, and add your own words, to that. So that will be the first,, interaction of every member of the team. And then we will have,, the the presentations or,, like semi presentations. To,, to get everybody on the same starting page. So with that, I I suggest that PERSON8 will start. And PERSON8 you can read what I wrote about your role. And you can correct it and yeah.",
            "Okay. You have written that I'm in the linguist, so I'm ki, I am,, thinking about the idea of summaries and meetings and looking at their,, at real meetings and their transcripts by eyes. And,, the results of,, automatic speech recognition and compare it to manual transcripts. So my task was,, to work with,,, automatic,, transcripts and anno and correct them. So we had annotators who corrected the transcripts. And then we looked at the data at the differences a little bit. So I have a data set that,,, with meetings, audio files, video files,, automatics automatic transcripts and manually corrected. And some of them are double manu, doubly doubly manually, manu, manually corrected, and some of them even three times, because we made several,, minutes for them. Then,, we,,. Then I work with minutes. It means that I designed the guidelines about. No, first I designed the guidelines for transcripts. So it was similar for as for the AME meeting corpus. And for,, ESCI meeting corpus. So kind of general rules for transcripts and annotators use them to,, correct the meetings. And then I designed the guidelines for minutes, but in much more vague way then for transcripts. So the idea was not to make the direct instructions of how the minutes should look like. But rather to get the general understanding how they can look like. So first I collected the information how the different minutes can look like. Theoretically and then read some literature about that, and got the idea so that it is naturally. That minutes are very, very different. According to what type, what, what field they are used in. So if that's a business meeting or some other types of dom, do, dom, domains. But,, still all of them are summarizations and,, still they contain the. So they,,, in general things that they contain the important information that was during, that was said the meeting. And then somehow fix. So people somehow fix what was, what was important. And I asked,. So I collected the minutes, the original minutes for the min, for the meetings we had. And I asked the annotators to,,, generate,, minutes according to,, my instructions and according to different instructions they could find themselves. And,, the idea now is,, to look at them automatically. That will. That is what PERSON9 going to do. But also to look at them by eyes and to see that the important things are not always the same. So different things see different important things in the meetings. And there is this is also my task in the,, in the project. Oh, what did I do? I super, I supervise the annotators. We at the moment we have about fifteen people working on the data. We have English and Czech data. And I'll I'll speak a little bit in more detail about the data later on. As I see that there is my and and little chapter later on. And so I'm collecting the data. Collecting feedback from the annotators and so on. Thank you.",
            "Yeah. Great. Thanks. So do we have PERSON6 already on the call or not yet?",
            "Not yet. So, let's, let's skip PERSON6 and let's move to the,, next person. Who is PERSON9. PERSON9 is new to the,, to the project,, as he has joined eleven days ago, and only remotely, because she cannot come to LOCATION1,, due to Covid restrictions. And,, so so we would be happy to hear, also your background in general, because it's only the to some extent me, who who knows your your CV. And then,, we're obviously primarily interested in in your role. So I see that you have already,, extended the description of that role which is.",
            "Actually I did that.",
            "No, I didn't do that.",
            "Oh, yeah, and I. Or PERSON8 did,, okay.",
            "I did. I'm sorry, really, I have, I have changed it,, some minutes ago. As it was already shared. Because we had a long discussion with PERSON9 with PERSON9 about your goals. And I think it should be discussed with either PERSON2 and PERSON9, and me. Because it is she seems to be little bit,, un-fixed yet.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That's perfectly okay. So, so PERSON9 please have your say towards this.",
            "Okay. So,, so, PERSON8 and I, we already had a meeting so that's why I think I was able to figure it out in whatever points have been modified. We modified according to that. Whatever the discussion we had. And so,, I would, I I think I I don't have much to say on this but and I have my doctorate in machine translation. So,, I I I'm new to summarization. And, so probably I'm just now working right now on the automatic metric. And so PERSON8 and we both have formulated these two goals. Like I have to distinguish two automatic minutes from each other, whether they belong to the same meeting or not. And how similar the two minutes are from particular meeting. So currently I'm building deep, deep neural network for the same. And so,, that's what I'm working right now. And so, previously, I I did,, I did built the deep neural networks for machine translation. So I have the previous experience. So I think I will be,, able to cope with the challenges, which I have for the summarization task. So let's see how it goes. I don't know what to say more.",
            "So what I'm not sure about is,, On PERSON2 has written this representation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What do you, did you mean PERSON2 trade representations.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "We were both really curious about it.",
            "Yeah. We both wanted to know that.",
            "Yeah, so let me,, let me go out for this list, because this would be a longer explanation. And I want to, I don't want to disturb the colleagues in the in the room. So the,, there is multiple funding sources to to that fu and that fully explains why I talk about representations. So can you still hear me well, is the connection good?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so yeah. So,, we all are here under the funding of PROJECT4, where the goal is,, the actual application. This is a research and innovation action. So if PROJECT4 does not deliver a working system, it is not necessarily a failure. We need to do good research towards a working system, and we have only a limited time. So if you run the shared ask if we have systems if we have the measure of, and then, the overall level of performance is insufficient for the application, but we see some improvement, and we have the task clearly defined, this is success of PROJECT4. But there is another source of funding, which is basic research and it's called OTHER. That's another grant I'm supervising. And I would actually,,, prefer PERSON9,, to be on this OTHER grant formally. And this OTHER grant,,, as a basic research, aims at good publications. So the main outputs are good, good papers. And the,, the grant is is very broad. It runs it runs for more years, two more years than PROJECT4 actually. And we are expected to to explain what the networks are doing. So I see it as a nice collaboration between like a basic research project,, where funded from OTHER, PERSON9 would,,, focus on the analysis of what the networks are doing. Obviously create her own networks, take part in the task,, but be more focused on the explanation of what is happening. On the the basic problems of the metrics of the goal as a as a whole. And,, and the with the representations I mean,, that,, if you have the network trained for a task and then you feed it with some input, it will create some vector representation of of that input. And,, this vector representation lives in the in vector space. So as there are word embeddings and document embeddings. We should have something like paragraph embeddings or snippet embeddings, and we should measure. We we should come up with a,, measures for similarity,. And it can be a simple vector similarity, like a Cosine similarity. But we need to know whether it matches.",
            "But we already. I'm sorry to interrupt PERSON2.",
            "Yep.",
            "We don't have the results for the,, the Cosine in the normal similarity measures we have. We already have results but they are not performing good. So PERSON8 PERSON8 did. PERSON8 did say that we need semantic vectors for that.",
            "Yes.",
            "So we need to picture the semantic the sentence to the can use contextual vectors rather than setting the.",
            "Yes. Yes exactly. So the the actual design, the structure of the network, and no. And and the the decision, whether the vectors are created just as a very ch of word vectors or whether they are contextualised or whether they are created yet in another type of aggregation. That is exactly the type of a research that we should be doing. And there. I I mention in the in this document,, that the representations are for small units and longer units of text. So. So this forms of aggregation. These methods of aggregation of smaller,, of of representations of smaller, pieces like individual words, lines, and then whole section of of lines from the transcript. And that compared to the representation that we get, for the the item in the agenda or maybe for the meeting as a whole. So thinks, things like that. This is exactly what we need to explore. And that's why I would,,, the like,,, highlighting the word representation. You correctly, say that,, it's very easy to calculate Cosine similarity when you have two vectors. But the research question is, whether this Cosine similarity is in any reasonable and interesting relation with the similarity that we want. So we want,, if we have two minute, two minutes for the same meeting. We want them to be,,, semantically similar. We assume that they are semantically similar. And we want the measure to reflect this. So the question is, how do we design the,, the automatic measure so that it reflects the the properties that we want as as users of,, of the original object.",
            "Sorry, sorry, PERSON2, she lost the connection.",
            "Yeah, I I I see yeah. So I'll,,, I'll repeat that later on on or, hopefully,, it's also recorded in,, in my machine. And,, this is for for the rest of the team. I hope it's,, it's,, clear that PERSON9,, should be focusing on the more basic questions,, and should be more concerned,, with,, the,, the vectors. And the operations with them that are like sensible and less so with the, shared task. As such. But,, the results of PERSON9, aha, yeah. I noticed that you, you got lost PERSON9. Sorry about that. So I'm I'm just summarising that you should be in my division of of labour. You should be,, more focused on the basic research, the basic questions and the analysis of what the network is doing. And the properties that the vector spaces have. And the definition of the vector spaces,, and, for you, the actual performance in the in the summarization task is just the by-product, and not not the main goal. For you the main goal is the explanation what is,, what is going on. Whereas for for others,,, we should aim at the at the application. At the at the success in the,, in the measure. But we all need to define the measure first.",
            "Yeah, yeah. On, On, but On just a que, a que, a question to. If I understand it correctly. But still, at first PERSON9 is making a code. She is making a search code. She is not just.",
            "Absolutely.",
            "She is not just using -.",
            "Yes, absolutely.",
            "This is what we have discussed yesterday. She is not just using some existing net, existing code.",
            "Absolutely. She will be modifying existing models, creating own models. Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And she doesn't just using existing model, code that that works very, very badly on documents. But she does try to combine different.",
            "Yes.",
            "-metrics and to get to the best one. And then is analysing what is going on.",
            "Yes, exactly, yes.",
            "Because. Yes.",
            "It is a technical and implementation work in this sense that you also need to prepare your tools. And your tools are the the models.",
            "Yes. And that's why I wanted also to point out that maybe it's not the best idea to begin to write the paper immediately at this very moment. But just to describe everything she does, is when I,, I hope PERSON9 hears me. So just, aha, no. But, okay,, anyway.",
            "There is no. It's never too late to start writing, even if it is a survey. Then,, that it's good to to write it down.",
            "So yeah, it's.",
            "Yes, I proposed, I proposed that PERSON9 really uses differe, This different metrics and describes what is going on. Not, not. Should not be directed as immediately a good research paper, but read. Yeah. But the review. Yeah, mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But really, these experiments are interesting. Just.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So PERSON9. I'm I'm sorry about your connection. Is it better now? Or is it unreliable? It seems like it is unreliable. So we can. That that can happen easily. And maybe ORGANIZATION3 Meet is not the best,, platform. It is -. So we will have to find ways,, how to, communicate reliably. And that will come with, like every day testing, essentially. Of the technologies.",
            "I think now. I think now it's better. Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah. So maybe it will help. If you switch off your camera.",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "Because that will save your. And in the meantime, I will double check with my desktop whether it's still recording so that we can later on see,,, see that. And if you have any comments, please say them.",
            "If if you turn our cameras off, PERSON9 have, would have a better connection.",
            "I did. I did off my camera.",
            "No, our cameras. Maybe not downloading our pictures. Would help you.",
            "I need to like.",
            "So we can try it. I'm switching off mine. So hopefully it will,, it will work for you better now PERSON9.",
            "Now, I think so. So what did I miss, I really want to know. Or I'll I'll ask PERSON8 afterwards. About what I missed?",
            "Yeah, I'm afraid the sound quality is too bad. So. So I,, I hope,, that I -. That you were able to understand,, what I mean, by representations. So that's the embeddings. And the question is the embeddings of what? Normal and common things, are embeddings for words. You can everage them, you can contextualize them. Like create them differently. And you can also create embeddings of longer units. Such as individual utterances, or sequences of utterances, and you can create embeddings of the corresponding summaries. So,,, you should PERSON9 focus on the various options. How the,, embeddings are created. Embeddings and representations are synonyms for me. So how the different embeddings are,, are created for the various shorts of pieces of text, and, transcribed,, speech. And how they,,,, it can be,, related to each other. So we want these,, vector spaces to grow similar. We want the texts, the, the long,,, units of, transcribed speech,, to be represented with similar vectors as the short,, summaries. And the question is how to create the vector, so that they have this property.",
            "Aha, yeah. Was focusing on the same. I'm probably we'll we'll we have the results by the end of this week.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is in the the description that I have just,,, provided,, that is like your long-term goal for the whole, or a year of of of your internship. And and at the same time, yes, that we need tangible results as soon as possible. So this is the the whole framing. And also, I'm I'm looking forward to the to the actual. The results of the first experiment that that you are doing. So,, yeah.",
            "So, a, and, and PERSON9 did you get what what we mean by short and pieces of texts?",
            "I think the,, the portions of text like we can, we can build,, like this ident. I lost you for a while I think that time the discussion was. For the long and short term. But as as I'm able to understand that long and short term means the the end grounds. We can take the shorter piece of text or we can take the longer piece of text.",
            "Yeah, with longer, we actually meant to the whole utterances or sequences of utterances, and possibly the whole meeting. And,, and within minutes,, this would be. Short would be individual key terms,, that are like mentioned. Then there could be representations of the single lines that the short items. And there, and then there could be representations of, like the sub three within the hierarchical minutes. And then again,, the the whole meeting,, as a of the whole thing. So the question is how to construct,, embeddings for each of these varying lengths of units so that they, like are relatable to each other.",
            "Mhm-mhm. And.",
            "As far as. Yeah.",
            "And did PERSON6.",
            "I'm sorry.",
            "And did PERSON6 work on something of that?",
            "No, not yet.",
            "Yeah, we do have. PERSON2, PERSON2 we have a paper on automatic matrix. So I read a paper by PERSON6.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it was the automatic metric. Or last year.",
            "But it it. But which was the. But that was not on the,, not these. These embeddings. So which paper do you mean?",
            "Not on the embeddings. It was on the Rouge metric, the Rouge metric that has automatic segregation yeah.",
            "So yeah, and I think. Let me,. There, there was a paper. That was automatically matching evaluation. But,, there was one new metric, which was,, which was presented. Only I think getting caption of data. For already present matrix..",
            "Quality of embeddings on sentiment analysis task. So did you day that PERSON6 was co-author or the main of this,, of this paper?",
            "Yes, he was yeah. He was. PERSON6 and you PERSON2, you both were the authors of the paper.",
            "So that's that's the that's the efficiency metric for the data models. That, that one, you mean?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, but that's, yeah. That is so PERSON6 is very independent in his writing. So,, this is, this. This is a general strategy that can be applied to any metric. And it's like, how should you evaluate your model. And the idea is that you should not evaluate the model just once with all your training data. But you should also evaluate the model with half the data and wi, with three quarters of the data, and by looking at the,, at how the performance grows. With this more and more data, you can actually,,, like predict whether the model still has future, whether it is whether it is worthwhile to collect more data or not. So that's the that's the idea. And it's not related to,,,, to meeting summarization at all. It it's yeah, the title says: \"Text summarization case study\". And that's because it's based on PERSON6's data set. The, which is the, created from abstracts of papers, so research research papers. So it's that,, the underlying,, data set is very different from the,, from the meeting that we want to summarize here. But still, this is the largest data set that, that we have. And,, we will have to use this data, set,, for pre-training of the models, for example. So that would be useful, but the domain is different. So this is not a metric that would be directly useful for for minutes at all.",
            "Uh-huh, so PERSON2 I wanted to ask on this. Do we all want the automated metric separately for the extractive and abstractive or do we want a joint like one?",
            "That is a good question. Well, we actually do not know, at the moment, if we prefer abstractive or extractive,, approach. And I think that,, the for humans. And this is something that PERSON8 should kind of gone from based on her experience so far. For humans there is one, just one scale,, of the, quality of of the minutes. Like to how much people,, like the minutes,, and this can have the sub scales. Like how much of detail is preserved, and, how much of the sentiment, for example, is is preserved. And,, the sentiment should not be generally preserved in the minutes, and and so on., but I don't think that there would be a,. For humans, for human users any use, useful detail,, or separate scale for, how much abstractive and how much extractive the the thing is. I think this this abstractive versus extractive,, division is useful only for of the authors of the systems of the of the summarization,, methods. And,, either you design the method in the way,, which allows it only to copy words, which makes it abst,, extractive. Or you use some,, structured prediction, essentially. So models, which produce complex outputs, sequences of strings. And then,, the suddenly the method becomes,, abstractive. And I think we should keep trying both abstractive an extractive. That's why we have so many people on the team,, each of which,, should try to take part in the shared task. Once we,, once we like define it. And the shared task should be,,, interesting and relevant for both; authors of abstractive systems and authors of,, extractive systems. So we should. I don't think that for users,, from the end user perspective. The abstract differs extractive is not important at all. I think,, what is,,, important is how much information is is preserved, and, and, whether in the bro, the preserved information is precise. So something like precision and recall are are more,, important.",
            "So at the same time, the metric that that maybe that that was your like early task. That you just have discussed with PERSON8. Was to come up with a measure and automatic measure,, that tells us,, whether a given summary is a abstractive or extractive.",
            "Yes. And with this measure we will then measure the manual summaries. And this will indicate whether people generally prefer to create abstractive style or extractive style. And maybe if people differ in this preference. And if if we find a general agreement that people prefer, let's say extractive summaries. This will be a clear guidance for us that,, designing and implementing a extractive system has a good chance of, of, working well. If people, If of human summaries are very much rewarded. So if they are abstractive, based on this scale that there were defined, then, then it's very important for us to focus on abstractive models.",
            "And.",
            "So the problems are. Now,,, I'm facing is that,, there are models that can talk in a semantic sense of this intense, like Botch and the universal encoder,, but,, when we apply it on the document. And so,, because every every minute. Different annotators will have the minutes in a different way. It's like if you, if you take from the data set we have collected. So,, we have minutes from few different annotators and the sentences are not in the same sequence. So probably,, comparing two documents,, based on the on the semantic sense,, applying to the entire document is is the challenge. Because right now we are able to convert that into contextual letters but probably not for the entire document.",
            "Yeah. And this is so surely possible. So, yeah, that. What is the heck going on, oh? I'm trying the meeting on both links and PERSON11 is working? Oh, so,,, yeah. PERSON6 is trying to connect and he is failing.",
            "I think he has joined PERSON2.",
            "Oh, finally, yes. So, I do not know, I I'm sorry. I do not know what us. I don't know what was happening PERSON6.",
            "PERSON6, are you there?",
            "So I I.",
            "We don't hear you.",
            "Me a request. And I I think it was the person though who did shared the document. And I. He did send it to me two three times and I just noticed now, and I did accept the request. So I think it was my. Me who was because it which he was not letting in the meeting.",
            "Oh, I see yeah. But PERSON6 we don't hear you. So that's the bad thing. So PERSON6, are you, are you in your office? Or elsewhere? If you are in your office, then I'm on the corridor in the corridor. And,, I can give you another machine, and, also a different headphones, and hopefully that will,,, that will help us to solve the issue. But I think it's it's a software problem. Because I know that Skype calls with you work well. So maybe if you can try different browser or different sound settings, maybe? Maybe the microphone is not allowed in this particular browser, or whatever.",
            "I think that the browser should be Chrome.",
            "So. Yeah, the Chrome is probably the safest. But I use Firefox and its work. It works well for me as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "So while PERSON6 is fighting with a this, I suggest that we,, go forward to PERSON7. And I would like PERSON7 again to briefly introduce himself to the rest of the team. And then to comment on or update, or improve in any way,, the, the roles that I see for for him.",
            "Okay. So, hello everyone. I'm PERSON7 from the Indian institute of technology. And I haven already joined the team but I'll be formally joining from September onwards. And my research so far has involved the documents processing.",
            "Yeah, maybe, maybe, could you move move to, move. Sorry, sorry Tutan PERSON7,,, if you don't have any external mike. That like the head set. Could you move closer to her microphone? Not too close, but like,, five or ten centimetres from the from the microphone that could make the sound better.",
            "Yeah, is it, is it better now?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So. Hello everyone. So as I said,, my research so far has been mostly focused on scholarly document processing. And I have been like mining,, research paper publications for solving different kinds of problems, ranging from, belonging of the document to the proper journal, analysis and recently I am working on analysing the quality of peer review in the scholarly scenario. So this has been my interest so far, but, but again so IWSLT task seems quite interesting and challenging for me so -. And I, and I would be soon joining the team,, formally. But I'm already. So as as on this. My, my kind of a role for this particular acquisition would be would,, be would be to look after the shared task in all aspects. Like writing a proposal, fixing a suitable venue, looking after the data set and making it available to the community and work on that. I'm also preparing my own submission to the shared task. And one of the I'm very much interested in, is to design a matrix which would, which would allow us more coverage than the Rouge scores. So yeah I'm looking forward to that.",
            "Yeah. And with the metric. With the evaluation of the task, one related thing. Is,, that we should prepare both; automatic and manual scoring of the submissions. So when designing the shared task, we need to have a plan how to evaluate the submissions regardless how many we get. To evaluate them manually and to evaluate them automatically. The manual evaluation. We have some funds for that, for example, in the OTHER grant. That I mentioned before. But we also should, propose manual evaluation so that the participants can,, like contribute for example, eight hours per participant. And was this crowd of experienced people we will see which of the,, summaries are better. So. So when designing the metric. We should think about both; manual and automatic evaluation. And we should obviously relate the evaluation, of the new evaluation methods to the existing ones. We should have obviously use Rouge and the standard things. But, I think that, that we need to come up with our own, because we will surely find,,, limitations of of existing metrics. So I hope that PERSON6 will be able to,, to present, sooner or later. If if if the technical problems, even,, remain,,, today. Then maybe at some other meeting,, I would like PERSON6 to present existing methods of evaluation. The next methods of summarization and the and their problems or their limited applicability to our domain, which is different, because it's,, spoken language. And text summarization of that. So,, all these differences of the domain and the limitations of the existing methods will drive us to create our own methods. So that is something that we also should keep in mind. To have both; manual and automatic,, scoring for the shared task.",
            "PERSON2 I want to.",
            "Yes, perfect. PERSON6, it works. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. And.",
            "And that, and you can also see me on. What is going on?",
            "Where is that?",
            "Yes, we can see you.",
            "Yes, we can see you.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, except. I'm I'm surprised. Can you, can you still hear me and see me?",
            "Yes, I. I always hear you well.",
            "But can you see, hear and see PERSON2. Because I'm, my.",
            "No, I can't see anyone. I just see your pictures in the circles.",
            "But you can. You can hear me? Because,, Firefox tells me that I've left the meeting and I sho, I can rejoin. I won't touch any button. If you confirm that you actually hear me.",
            "Yes, I can hear you. And I see too all. So.",
            "So it is good. One of the one of them's only recording,, the session,?",
            "Okay..",
            "Yeah. But I'm not touching anything, because it is half way away, but I'm still in the meeting. It's confusing. Okay.",
            "PERSON2, before PERSON6, PERSON6 starts, So I just want to like ask you few questions. So as we communicated over, over email so I think would be the one.",
            "Yes.",
            "Which we should be mostly targeting. And I see I want to share with you. That today the workshop confirmed the proposals in live.",
            "For, for the next year. So I don't know but like should we try writing up proposal for for the joint score? At the baseline.",
            "Yes. So I think we definitely need a shared task. And I think it's better. So, so maybe PERSON6 is experienced, more experienced in the summarization area than than I am. So I maybe PERSON6 can have his own recommendation on this. But I think it's it's good to organise our own workshop on,, like spoken meeting meeting summarization and have a shared task as part of this new workshop. If PERSON6 would say that this is risky because it will not be known. And people will not join, then we can follow PERSON6's advice. And and try to get that is shared task as part of some established venue. But I would, think it makes more sense for us to create a fully dedicated workshop to a to a meeting summarizations.",
            "Okay, so,, now. I just say something about this or just I I start with the slides?",
            "Yeah. So, about this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But first about this,, and then about your role, and only then the slides.",
            "So, regarding the shared task. From what I have seen the shared tasks,, that shared tasks come when they, when there is a lot of data and high quality. The quantity and quality of data about the task.",
            "So it's reasonable to assume that if we have so it. It is we somehow have a some quantity, some quantitative data and qualitative data about transcripts, about meeting transcripts, if this is the idea of course. And then I guess we can launch it as a shared task, but in this si,, current situation. I don't think that we have such data. So.",
            "I think that, yeah. Shared task without having the data.",
            "No we. We have the data. I just don't agree with you that a lot of data is needed,, for the shared task. I think it is more important to have a clearly defined way of evaluating who is best. That's more important. And the data needs to be only as big as the test set, actually. And if you have more than that for the training. Then, that's that's great,, but. For example, I just yesterday, I heard about the shared task in a non-native,, speech recognition. So speech recognition for non-native English, and they,, require all the participants to use only 160 hours of training data. And that's about ten times less than what people would like to have. And what people have in English only settings. So it's fairly limited,, and still, it seemed that the shared task will have a huge attendance or the the the promotion for the shared task is very strong. So, I I don't think that we should,, limit ourselves,, and, say that we are not in a position to run the shared task,, because of lack of data. Oh, what is more serious is a to have a clear,, method of evaluating and describe that,. And this can be both manual and automatic. So that is that is okay, but we need to have clear,, rules. Yeah. So back to a,, back to my fir, original question. Would there be a venue where you would prefer us to join? Or does it sound good for you. If we go for a fully independent workshop. I would go for fully independent workshop.",
            "I don't really know about any venue. There should be some around that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So there is this old history of of the D-U-C document, understanding conferences, and then they stopped. And I wasn't not following that at all. So I would like to ask someone, and I do not know, who was the best person from you, from you to to do this. To do the little survey like, uh-oh? Where did these,, conferences lead to? What was the what was the result then? Or did the, the did? The the Rouge is one of the products of this I believe, But were there any other,, like notable,, observations or notable knowledge state of the art that that we should not forget, and we should build up on? Or, it is,, should be start from scratch or? Yeah. So who? Is there anyone who would,, volunteer to review the D-U-C conferences?",
            "I think I can do that.",
            "Yeah, so but that will happen only after you, but that will happen in in September. Yeah. Because until -",
            "Yeah, but but but I can. I can be. Like I am in touch with PERSON, like the per, the person, who.",
            "Oh, okay. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I am in good touch with him, so I can I can just send him email and let you know what, what was the outcome of D-U-C.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "And also, also I'm in touch with PERSON from Minsk, who have write the task. So maybe I can just from him an email and I let you know.",
            "Yes, please, please do. And ad ho, he may remember me. I definitely remember him, he has visited LOCATION1 a few times. And,, I met him, I met him in in in person a few times as well so he may remember me. So that's that's good. So please get in touch with him. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Okay. So that's. So we, we so far, we think that we should put up our own proposal for workshop. And PERSON7 please make sure that we do that in in due time. Which is the 5th of October, or something like that. And by the way, if anybody is taking notes of what we are saying here into the ORGANIZATION3 Doc. That would be useful. Otherwise, our annotators will do that later on as a as well, but it's I think it is also interesting to have a contrast. If a summary,, which is taken by someone who is directly in the in the meeting. And,, summary, which is then created afterwards by the,, by the annotators. And before we go to the first presentation, lets finish the round of introductions. So in the,, in the ORGANIZATION3 document. I see everybody, in in the list, but PERSON6 is not in the. Oh, yes, you are now active. So there is there is a little description. If you click on me. I've I've highlighted the description of a of,,, of the way that I see your Eri PERSON6 your role in the,, in the team. So please introduce yourself and introduce the background that is relevant for meeting summarization. And correct anything that I have written wrongly in the, in the role of,, of yours.",
            "So am I supposed to read this thing here?",
            "Yes, you you can or you, or you know, yes.",
            "So I have some experience in automatic summarization; like both extractive and abstracting pross. And of course I have the hands on experience of the tools. And the the the frameworks. I've, I've done a lot of work on my own actually. So I've also worked with scrapping some some some websites and some collections of creating another data sets. And then of course, trying different methods on the data sets. Like, title generation data sets or also prediction of the lengths of different,, some like different publications. That is my recent work. And,, and also generation data sets so different data set that, can be used for this task. Like generation, title summarization and also title length prediction or abstract length prediction. Regarding the PROJECT4,, or so the problem now is in to finish the pipeline that we have designed. And having the first working prototype. That is the basic prototype. And then, it if works well, we will try to extend it like with some other features or functionalities. That is. For example one of them is the agenda. Like populating the agenda, of the,, of the of the minutes of the of the protocol of the summary. So,, this is now mostly,, practical problem like, practical problem, of of getting the summaries, getting the proper summaries, and getting grammatically corrects summaries. And getting the the decisions of the the highlights that we want to get from a meeting transcript. Yes, so well the rest is just the Python workbench. The rest is okay. So this is what I can say for moment. But in the slides that I have you will also know more about the pipeline, the state of the status of the work that is until now. And then.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, that's,, that's great. I just wanted to mention aloud the Python workbench that you are working on. And I assume that the pipeline is kind of implemented it in that, or that the workbench allows you to,, to do experiments and the best ones then would be put into the pipeline or something like that. So, later on. Not necessarily today. But later on, it may be interesting for others to,, to to hear from you what the workbench,, could offer for them. So that they could, like the,,, they build up on the environment that you are building for yourself,, and collaborate easier and save time in in,, the the set up. So this,, I just want this as. So that your work on on the work bench is not forgotten.",
            "Yes, But it is actually not something per say it is just a collection of of the code, the data and the tools I were going to use.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "For our goals.",
            "Yeah, exactly. It is not too fancy but it will save time for people who have not gone through this yet.",
            "So, it's just the place where we can go and we can add things. And add experiments and then put the experiments somewhere else.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, the something that I am really not start over. Like not everyone starts with his or her own code from from scratch. So that's it.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So it's just a GitHub repo that will help us to re-use the code and the data. And the and the result that will show us as as we reached up to now.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. Thank you. So before we go,, forward to your presentation. Then I would like PERSON5,, to very quickly also mention his role. But he is like the,, one of the side members of of the team. So to say,, because his main focus is on a speech processing,, and, the he's only helping out with, the annotation interface. But he will show the interface today to us. And, I believe a lot that,, the way the interface looks,,, of like a limits or boosts, the the performance of the annotators. And the like overall utility of the of the task. So if the if the task is well thou. It like it is very closely correlated. If the task is well thought through, then it is easy to a develop a good interface. If the interface is good, then it's very easy to talk about the task and explain it to other people. And it is easy to go get good agreements. For example, in the in the shared task. So that is why I think the the annotation interface is actually critical,, design component in the overall,, goal. So PERSON5, if it's there is anything that you would like to add,?",
            "So, I I think you said already everything.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know what to say about me because I'm just creating the the user interface for the annotators. But if I could, because I need to leave briefly. So I would like to present the the interface right now, if possible.",
            "Yes. So I think it is actually it is. Well, if you don't mind. Let's, let's finish with PERSON4. So one more person.",
            "Okay, okay, Yeah, yeah.",
            "But then,, I think it's okay, fo to save your time, to to move the item three in the agenda, the annotation interface,,, to the beginning,, and then, we will have in in our heads the illustration. And then it will also be easy for,, for us to follow the slides by PERSON6. So if if there is no one opposed, then I agree. Okay, so I don't hear any any strong opposition. So the last person on the call is PERSON4. And PERSON4 is now not officially employed on the project. He was just, how many weeks was it. Was it two months, a two month internship,, here in LOCATION1, last year when the travels were still possible. And he did the very early experiments with automatic summarization, including,, like a kind of black box approach to training. The, some some deep,,, neural network models, right? And and using existing toolkits for the summarization. And the results so far, were mainly negative. But that was very preliminary. And, like it's nothing bad to. You, that that is not a bad conclusion. But we would like to,, still built something and reach something positive from from this. So that's why I have PERSON4 on the call. And if PERSON4 will have more time then,, we can employ him also remotely. And I would like to finish PERSON4's work,, so that there is some paper or some, Some other tangible result,, from from that. So PERSON4, is there anything that you would like to add?",
            "I just want to apologise, because I because I missed the first email, and I wasn't ready for this meeting. So, I couldn't prepare something to,,, present and the and nothing more. And Hi PERSON6.",
            "Yeah. That's the editor, like don't worry. Like I sent it only through an invite, and I I didn't pay attention to double checking whether it reached all the people or,, or not. So that was actually my fault, but don't worry. So you you see what people are doing here. And,, independently will just let me and PERSON8 know how much time you could devote to this. And if you would like the agreement, and then we'll set it up to formally. But first, yeah, just just decide for for yourself. And also will will see ho. Yeah, what what do we all remember from your last year's,, work. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, my last point,,, before we go to the presentations is that,, I see myself, PERSON8, PERSON6, PERSON9 and Turkan PERSON7 as the key people who should contribute to the exact definition of the shared task. And, the evaluation metric for the task. Because everybody is bringing their own angle to that. And they are inexperienced and we need to find a union that fits all of the all of us. So that's,, yeah, that's it. For the task, both manual and automatic. Okay, so,, I would like now to ask PERSON5 to present the,, to present the annotation interface. And then PERSON6,, to present,, his slides and then PERSON8 to present the data sets. So what we are changing the agenda little,? And I will have to rejoin, because I don't have the screen now. So I would like to see the screen as well. So I'll leave the meeting for second, but, PERSON5 feel free to start.",
            "Okay. Thank you. So I'll start presenting about. Can you see my,, screen?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, so this is the user interface,, I've been working on. I don't know which colour do you prefer, light or dark? Which is better visible for you.",
            "Maybe light one.",
            "Light one, okay. And the font is not really that important like, yes? So,, the important thing is that,, there are several panels that are important for the annotators. First we have the translator can choose the transcript,, which,, should be worked with and the minutes. Because,, as PERSON8 please correct me if if I'm wrong. There is many many transcripts, many versions of transcripts and many versions of minutes. Because,, each annotator or several annotators should provide corrected transcript and,, their own minutes of the meeting. So for example.",
            "Actually, with transcript I I I I would rather say that we take one transcript, the last one. So it is true that there are some versions of the transcript but this is because as I gave more,,, as I asked more annotators to make minutes I gave them the already,, Corrected transcript and they corrected it again. So did in the correct version of the corrected transcripts. So it's gets better and better, kind of. As so we take the last version of the transcript of minutes.",
            "OK so.. But,, the important thing is here that,, the annotator can chose which which transcript and which minutes to work with. One can easily edit the minutes or add, add new minutes. As you can see. Or, when, or. For example,, change,, change the transcript and the actually, the actual annotations are happening so that one chooses some dialog adds and can annotate them either with the minute. For example I just. Here. So these dialog. Are,, are connected with the first minute that is actually the headline here. And there are, there can be come problems with the dialog adds. For example this is a meta annotation, you can see organisational and you can, you can chose the problem by double clicking on the organisational or maybe there is some incomprehensible speech. So we can change the problem. For the annotators, there, to to see the the linking between the dialog adds and the minutes are are done with colours. So each each minutes has it's own colour. So, as I, as I scroll down, the the minutes that are used in the in the visible area of of the. Dialog adds are highlighted with with their code colour. As you can see the colours are changing. And,, What is more important. Maybe that is all from the from the interface. And maybe I I will briefly describe the representations behind behind and. So the so the whole annotations are represented. The whole meeting is in one directory on the disc. There are three sub folders, there are annotations, minutes and transcripts, and there could be a recording for the annotators that can be played using this,, panel. And the representation for the transcripts is quite straight forward, it's just a plain text,, with optional speaker. And there is missing,, time because, we, we can also also add to the transcript time stamps to to allow,, better,, better, experience for the annotators. Because when I. This is not yet implemented, but actually be when the transcript has the time stamps, it can, when the annotator chooses one dialog add then the player should synchronise,, with the selected dialog add. So that's the. That's the transcripts. Minutes, again are also plain text. There. I don't know whether, which or how much how much levels should have the meetings but I guess only two. PERSON8?",
            "How much of what?",
            "Levels. One level, so, so the general instruction it it can be. Well, actually two. It can be once included.",
            "Okay, so but it's not important for the for the for my annotating program because,, it's it's just represents each minutes as a independent,, line in this panel. And finally the annotations, the linking,, between,, between,, dialog adds and the minutes and problems is done with simple, simple or plain text file. Lots of first,, first column is the ID of the dialog text. The zero, the the first, first dialog back and so on. In the second column, there is ID or line number of the, of the minutes,, annotated. So as as we saw here,, these minutes are linked with the very first minutes and,, the the fist column is the problem one. That the annotators. There is an organisational problem, so it's the first one. As you can see,, as you can see the representation is as as straight forward as as,, it's easy to create new, it's easy to create, the,, new meeting and to to work with it later on. So, I guess that's all. If there is. If you have any questions?",
            "May I ask PERSON9 if she understood what is going on in this annotation. And if she understands the code and if she will be able to use it.",
            "So. PERSON8 I think,, I was not able to get much because of the sound quality probably. But a little bit I'm able to get it.",
            "Okay. Can you hear me?",
            "Yes, I can hear you. I can hear PERSON5 as well.",
            "But,,, the sound quality was not that good that I was not able to grasp everything what PERSON5,, showed.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. The technical note. I've placed it,,, the,, the the note,,,, the note, the remark about the automatic captions by ORGANIZATION3 ASR. So,, at the bottom part, there is turn on captions button in the bottom right corner...",
            "Yeah, I'm..",
            "And as I see the the these are pretty good. So they can help,, with the bad sound quality.",
            "Yeah. I just. I just turned it on. Thank you. Thank you PERSON2.",
            "Hi PERSON5, this is PERSON7. So do you have this web built version to that, maybe we can try? Or,, I would also be interested to try annotating one meeting via this interface. So how do you think that this would be possible?",
            "So I think that this is in progress. Are we, are we ready with with this interface PERSON5?",
            "So this interface is in Python. It's not web based, and will. That was never planned to be a web based? But, I I guess that PERSON5 can easily share it. I would like to point out that, the main purpose of the interface is not to create the minutes. But the main purpose is to,, link the minutes with the transcripts. So,, that's, it's more,, for, the preparation of the,, of the measures of how for example, good. How. What is the recall and precision of a given minutes,, given the transcript. Rather than a. It is not a. It's a -. Rather than an annotation for someone who is writing the minutes.",
            "Yes, so it serves mainly for the purpose, for the annotator or maybe for for you just to explore the minutes and link it with the minutes and the transcripts.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it is like for the alignment.",
            "Could you share the code with us? Because I would like to use and it will be good to help me to,,, for the automatic metric which I am developing.",
            "Well.",
            "That would, yeah.",
            "At the moment, we don't have the annotator, the annotator, the annotations yet. So PERSON5 is creating the interface and he is almost at the end of this creation. And now we will test it on the annotators. And soon, we ha. We will have the annotations. It it means that transcripts will be connected with minutes. So when you see minutes. You know, which line in minutes,, is corresponds to that piece in transcript. And this is the information that you PERSON9 can use in your experiments.",
            "And I think it is important that you can use it. It may happen that you can need something that PERSON5 can implement. And that's why it's it is fine that if. It would be fine if you understand what,,, how it works. Maybe you need, need something that we can implement before we make,,, annotations. So at the moment, I am fine that you just know that it exists. That we are creating something like that. Now, we will test,, it on annot, annotators, and as far as we began, as we get the connected data. I think I will send you what we get and you you understand. You, you try to use it. And you, you have some comments. You will,, you will comment it. Just I wanted that you both know about each other at the at the moment. Okay?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. At the same time. I agree with PERSON5 that this interface may be useful to browse the meetings,, and so the, transcripts and the summaries, even without the annotation. So as soon as the data is formally converted,, to the good input format for this tool, even before the annotation is done. This will be useful for both; PERSON9 and PERSON7 to go through,, this. Yeah, okay. So if you don't have any other questions or comments on the user interface. PERSON5, I would just like the check. Is it in one of the PROJECT4 repositories, or is it not versioned yet?",
            "It is not versioned yet. Of course I I have my own private repository,, but I I I'm planning to create one in the PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And publish the code there.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let's do it rather soon. And it's it's good to have users. Because they will de-bug it from the. And both PERSON7 and PERSON9 will be more experience users. Much more experienced users then the annotators. So,, they if they provide any comments on how to run it, it will be useful and will simplify the life also of the annotators.",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "Thank you. So. I think now is good time to move to the presentation by PERSON6, right? And.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "PERSON5.",
            "Okay. Sorry to interrupt. Because I I need to go. I need to leave. So if you have any questions or for me? Or or I can leave now?",
            "Yes,, I think you can leave now. If, if if anyone has a, if anybody has any questions on you,, then they should simply email you. For everybody,, who is who has some agreement with us already, actually including PERSON4,, there is the ORGANIZATION4 mail, the surname at ORGANIZATION4, MF,, ORGANIZATION2 ORGANIZATION1 dot CZ. So just surname PERSON3; at ORGANIZATION4, that would. That will work.",
            "Ok. Thank you very much.",
            "Yes, thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Bye, thank you PERSON5.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON6, if you can share your screen. That would probably,, be,, good. Otherwise, we also have the slides. If that's possible.",
            "Now, how how can I do it? Can somebody tell me?",
            "Present now, top bottom.",
            "Present now, okay. Present now your entire screen.",
            "Or a window.",
            "Okay, so one minute, please. Oh, I need to allow some permission here, but. How can I get permission.",
            "Oh, you need some permission. So then PERSON9 could you please give the permission.",
            "You must grant permission in order to screen share.",
            "So I think ORGANIZATION3 me. The ORGANIZATION3 meet was set up by PERSON7, so.",
            "Okay.",
            "Present now your entire screen.",
            "So PERSON6 can just click on the \"Present Now\" button.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, and I have two options; your entire screen and the window. I click on \"your entire screen\" and I get: \"Can't share your screen. You must grant permission in order to screen share \".",
            "Okay, so. I don't know but did you. So did join with the same e-mail,, link or?",
            "I think that PERSON6 did join with the Gmail address not with the official email address. So I think,, that is a problem that he is not able to present. I will try to rejoin. I will try to rejoin now. So.",
            "PERSON6, can you join with your another email address. I think he left already.",
            "Yeah. But, I don't think it is possible to,, to like, for example, I have my departmental email address, and that's not linked.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To my Gmail account. So, there is no way for me to to join meetings with my departmental address. Or on purpose I keep those separate. So,, it's important. If you could invite also the other user name,, that,, that was the the G. H. user, I'll I'll paste that. Oh, yeah. But we cannot hear you now. So there is the microphone problem now.",
            "Now, you can hear me I guess.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right?",
            "Yep, okay.",
            "So once again, your entire screen. So. Select. Okay. Entire screen allowed. So, what do you see now?",
            "Yeah.",
            "It works?",
            "It works in second we will see it.",
            "So now, do you see the entire screen?",
            "Yes, we do.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So here we have the slides then. So okay, we can start. So this is. These is the editor picture that was designed by PERSON2 time ago and it shows the scenario like situation. So we have different peers. Like different persons that that will talk possibly in different languages. And there is a predefined agenda with some topics that will be discussed. And the participants will discuss the topics and the then their voice will be translated automatically. So there are some stages like, or, first of all speech recognition then machine translation. And then, at the end of the pipeline there is the minuting. That like will read the. Will will will have the transcript that is ready, like and it's in English. That say, in one language, in one common language. And this. So this model, this box that we will. That we are working on. We will have to produce the the protocol or the summary or the minutes of the entire transcript. So this is once again, the the full PROJECT4 pipeline. So first of all, we have the participants who presumably will speak in the languages, in different languages and the input of the system is of course, the, is their speech. It's like our speech now. That there is being recorded. And then we have this automatic speech recognition that creates the transcript of the dialogs. But when the speech recognition, machine translation module that it's the spoken language translation module that is used to normalise the output of ACR. For matching with expectations of the machine translation. So this will probably use techniques like centred boundaries identification and other, and other tema that remove the disturbances, the spoken language disturbances. And so after the translation we have this minuting,, this minuting box. And then also the the minuting demonstrator. That is supposed to be used and tested by our partners, that is ORGANIZATION6. So this was the big picture of the initial PROJECT4 proposal. So now. Let's focus on our task. That is the automatic minuting task. So here, here we have the sub tasks. How we conceive this task. So first we have the text segmenter, the the segmentation the transcript segmentation. That that splits the text into segments that should be a couple of sentences long, each of them. And the important thing here is to to to keep in each of the clusters. The resulting clusters. It's important to keep the semantically related phrases,, so that we have like, we have the the utterances that describe the same topic. Cos as we, as I as I explained there will be different topics that are discussed. And then the next we have the segment level summaries. So it is going into each of these segments or clusters we will somehow have to reduce their content, their size. By removing again disturbances, and repetitio, the word repetitions. And other redundant, redundant phrases. So this will produce like more concise, more concise segments. Discussion or utterances, the that we will need to. That we will process further. And next, next in the five. Task five three we have the. We have the transcript summarization. Which is generate. Which produces the overall minute, for the minutes for the meeting. And again here, we aim we aim to identify the system of the conclusions that are the most usual, and most important take-away messages from the from the meeting. And finally, the the the the the last the last the stage is the topic matching. In the sense that we need to populate the initial agenda. For the. So in each of the closes of the agenda, when we put some sentences from the summary that match to that semantically match to that point. With that agenda point. So now let us go to a more,, graphical representation of this four stages. So you have the schematic view here with the inputs outputs and and for the minuting task that I mentioned above. So I will explain. Try to say something about all of this now in the following slides. So first, we have the inputs as -. Which are the whole meeting transcripts and the predefined agenda with it's topics. The dialog transcript is probably the messy and in the sense that it comes out from the ASR. So,, will probably have redundancies in it. And we have the predefined agenda that is just the list of topics to be discussed. Here we have some issues like it may have on the slide the topic of agenda are not discussed at all. I mean, it's, we always expect to discuss all the topics of meeting but it may happen that some of the topics may not discussed, may not be discussed. And the others possible like let's say, awkward scenario is that new topics come out of the discussion, and they don't appear in the agenda. So these are some let's say rare cases that we should be prepared to handle. And next we have the outputs. Like the primary objective is to have minutes of of the entire transcript. And we also want to have the the filled agenda with the minutes sentences matched to the corresponding agenda topics. One of the problems, in the initial problem was the data scarcity problem. So first we searched for corpus. And I guess I've we found a couple of them. And for example, the ORGANIZATION5 discussions. But there were always problems like, like lack of the the summaries like lack of the minutes. That was the most common problem. And the actually that there is not, is not common to have. To find this. These transcripts and the the summaries, just ready, just prepared. To have them on the internet, on internet or somewhere on the web sites. Because most of the institutions, the companies have restrictions about publishing their data. So, the two best let's say candidates for experimenting on this task were ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 corpora. Which which,, are processed in a very similar way, which come in an XML format. And they were both processed in 2005 and they are also the most popular in the. Literature. That. In the literature like dialogue summarization or meeting summarization literature. So, next,, another initial activity was recording a processing our own internal meeting. Which is. Which goes on. Which is the work in progress. So the output is the deliverable that we expect is a data set that could be possibly used for. Not just for our task. From. By us but also by other,, researchers in this field. Like publishable corp,, publishable corpus that can be used by corporate community. And as PERSON2 said, the ideal case would be to launch also the shared task with this data set. Like,, launch the task and relate the data set to the task. The problem. One of the problems with the two data sets, that I mentioned is, was their format in XML. And so one other initial activity was, to to to,, to create some to duplicates to replicate this content in plain text format. And then checking the annotations. The different annotations that were provided. So,, as I said -. As I mentioned the the the the process of converting the the XML content into the text content, is is automatic and we have some code about it. It's in the the repository. The GitHub repository that we are using and. But another problem of course is the fact that the big models, especially when we tried the abstractive approach to summarization. The big neural network based modules are data hungry and these two data sets PROJECT1 and ORGANIZATION7 they were not really sufficient. So another thing was to check for another similar data sets on CNN Daily Mail or English Gigaboard. And somehow use them for the training part of the experiments. And then test in the union of CNN and the,, union of PROJECT1 and ORGANIZATION7 corpora. So another thing that,, was tried was the possibility of short cut the scheme, like you see in this image. So,, we tried to omit the segmentation and compression steps as shown here. In other words, they tried to get the minutes directly from the transcript. And as I mentioned, we used the transfer learning idea. Like training on CNN Daily Mail. And and then testing it on ORGANIZATION7 data. And the the plain plain text ORGANIZATION7. And,, of course the results were poor. Like, the very low Rouge scores, but also very messy, obviously, very messy summaries and the was not gramatory correct. So going on. Here we have the first,,,, stage of the pipeline of the minuting pipeline. And before we start with the segmentation, we actually perform most of the normal cleaning steps that are usually common in most of the natural language processing tasks. Like tokenization and the removal, removal of the messy symbols. And text the goal of the step, of the steps of the pipeline step as mentioned is to break the spoken language text into segments or clusters which are,, which are related grammatically. Which are -. Which are cohesive in a sense that the content is about the same topic. So the other step is,,, something more about the diarisation. It's another possible feature that we can and. So,, it it kind of it identifies the speaker. The the speaker of certain sentence or utterance. For the moment we have kind of a dummy diarisation that is available in the two data sets PROJECT1 and ORGANIZATION7. So we have the anonymous speakers, just labelled with letters like A, B, C or D. And, so this. In this sense, if we if we will add the diarisation,, if if we. If it will work well, we can add it as a real feature of our pf our deliverable. Or we may just use the dummy. Just use the dummy diarisation approach jut to be compatible with both IMI and ACSI for for the rest of the experiments. So going on. The next step is a the segment summarization. Or summarization applied in each of the segment or clusters. This is like,, -. This resembles the sentence compression task, even though the our clusters should be longer than one sentence. They are probably couple of sentences long. So the objective here is to, to further improve the text quality. Removing the disturbances and redundancies. And of course we need to preserve the, the or to assure the grammatic, the correctness, the grammatical correctness of each of the, in each of the clusters. From a technical point of view,,, there are some recent studies about using LSTM networks,, and cloning the trees, the the the trees, the branch piece of of each sentence. So that the the results. The output sentences or phrases, and the segment or the segment is,, bit more consise. So going on with the next pipeline stage. So here we have the,, the dialogue summarization sub-task. So. And so after, after having the concise segments we will need to to to extract or to generate the decisions, the decision phrases or sentences from each of them. So that we put them in the main. The the final deliverable, the the final minutes. And so once again, we need to preserve the the grammatical correctness. So here we might have also some issues that happen when we extract different words and combine them together so they have to be logically correct. So,, technically we are, we are exploring both; extractive and abstractive approach for the summarisation. For the transcript summarizations. So we will probably. It is somehow. The extractive approach should be logically easier and more convenient because it. It preserves the phrasing. And in such application. In this king of applications, especially in certain domains, the legal domains the legislation or I don't know. It's important to preserve the phrasing, because changing the words may change considerably change the meaning and when things are for. Have to do with leg, legislation it's very important. So logically, the extractive approach should look better, especially from the human based evaluation. Because Rouge doesn't much care, doesn't really care much about the phrasing. And so we we are, we are usually for the training as I said we are, we are using the CNN Daily Mail Collection until until now. And the results of course haven't been really good. Especially, especially as seen by a person. Like, like a human evaluation, like from the perspective of manual evaluation. Because the Rouge scores are not that terrible but,, the the summaries like evaluated from a person, like a,, are show show some some disfluences, show still some some disfluences. And finally,, another, the the final stage of the pipeline and that could be, an extra feature. Or in not definitely the,, feature that we aim to implement in the the basic prototype. The first prototype that we want to, we want to to produce as a deliverable. So here now, now we have to match the transcript or the the minute sentences but, sentences with the with the correct or corresponding agenda topic that we have in the beginnings. Of each of the decision sentences that we will have in the in the minutes should match in one of this, one of this topics that we have in the agenda. So finally, we also we also aim to produce a demonstrator. That should be a software tool, like for example a script, an auton, autonomous script that will read the the transcript. That will work the real time let's say. Reading the transcript that grows and producing,, almost in real time the the the summary the the the the the the minutes of the of the meeting. And those are populating the agenda. So every time that transcript grows to a certain amount of words, for example five hundred of word or something like that. These scripts should should be activated and and produce the and produce the both,, both the minutes ant that point and also the the active agenda until that point. And then it should go to sleep and,, and reactivate itself until the next let's say five hundred words are ready in the tra in the transcript. So,, some conclusions. Well, first of all, this will be a hard task. It is not easy to implement task. Because of the nature of the text and because of the nature of of spoken language. It's not easy to, to preserve correctness. And to to identify the main, the main topics, the main sentences, the main phrases that we have in a in a in a meeting,, transcript. And of course the the we want to put all of them in the, in the summary and the big problem is the lack of domain data. Because the meeting transcripts are hardly found online and our work I guess with recording our meetings is not that producing huge amount of data. And of course the quality of the data that are produces should be carefully checked. So,, if there are any questions? Should I close the slides?",
            "I have a question to your presentation with different steps. For for example to dialog summarizations and other at the scheme. Which steps have you already,, implemented? Did you? Do you have summarizations? And my next question is: \"Where can I find it?\" So I'm a little bit,, unaware of your progress in this direction.",
            "Well, you can find it in the GitHub repo actually. So you did it? You have the systems for dialog summarizations, yes?",
            "No, no, no. I mean, all. Everything that is -. All the data, the code and everything is in GitHub repo but we don't have yet the working basic prototype. Because the first. Like the goal is to finish to have it, to have the basic prototype. The basic prototype means that the agenda completion, the four steps so this step, the step of the pipeline is not available. So we have only these steps until the dialog meeting, minute is produced. So the agenda is not. It's let's say an extra feature. So the the goal is to have the basic prototype. That goes from the dialog transcript,, text segmentation segment summarization, dialog summarization and dialog minutes. And for the moment we don't have it, because,,, the first experiments that we run with PERSON4 produced the produced bad results. So we have to go back to these two steps that are the text segmentation. The text segmentation is good. It's finished correctly I guess, because the quality was nice. So we have now. We have to go back to the task five point two and five point three to improve their quality and then,, we can see the basic prototype finished.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we are now work.",
            "If I may say.",
            "Sorry PERSON8, please ask.",
            "You are now working on the prototype?",
            "Yes.",
            "The goal is to improve these two points; five point two and five point three. So that we have an acceptable basic prototype. From the quality. From the output quality point of view.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "An, and, may I ask one more? Or are you going to,?",
            "Sure, sure.",
            "The next question is kind of naive question generally about the situation. When we saw the task like performing, it had two summarizations for the same text. Are you able to say that they are, that these two summarizations are the summarizations for the same text?",
            "From the quantity. From the automatic evaluation perspective, I guess you cannot say, because if we have high scores, like Rouge scores for both of them. It may happen that we have high Rouge scores for both of them but then, in the next step, the person reads the two summaries, one of them can be excellent and one of them can be junk. So, I guess that's the human evaluation that will tell. But, that will say, that,, probably, they are enough similar. So they come from the same transcript or that they are very different. So there it should. There should be a human evaluation about that.",
            "So you think that automatically, so you think that automatically we cannot make it.",
            "No,, in this task we are working on. The automatic evaluation is very partial, is,, must be followed by a human evaluation.",
            "Okay, thank you. Okay. Thank you.",
            "So thank you PERSON6 for this great summary of,, the work package. And the task commons,, this is a, this is,, this is exactly what what I wanted to hear from you. That's that's good. And I'm. I have a question, which is very much related to what PERSON8's question was. The first one. Like how much of this is actually implemented. My question was,, actually just asking for details. So,, in some of the, tasks, for example, the text segmentation. You mentioned,, by eye bowling, the outputs,, the segmentation looks like a finish component and and works well. This is great to hear. But we would like to see the outputs,, on our meetings as well. So,, if you can share the the full outputs,, on on the meetings that you ran so far. And also, if you have any,,, those measures, any scores for each of the tasks, each of these components that can help us to, to see, what is, the the performance that would be useful to put into the slides. So these slides are very good. Not only for our group but they also are the good basis for the user and advisory board meeting, which we have next Wednesday. And the dry run for, for this like preparatory meeting, actually. Not, not that we should test the presentations, but a preparatory meaning is tomorrow,, at ten. The summarization would be there presented,, at the user and advisory board meeting, only with a five minutes slot. But still, this is the the basis. These slides are great for that,, and I would still like you to complement the slides with some numbers. That if you have any. That say how each of these components is working. And then sample outputs, so that we can. But just by looking at the sample output so that we can see. What, exactly what you had. What you said. So you said that this, this component is is too bad. This component is good. We would like to see the outputs as well so that we can make our own judgment. At at the same time to compare it with your judgment. So if you could this it will be very useful.",
            "Yes, sure, I mean. These slides, these slides, these slides are kind of basic. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They will be and they will be extended in the future for sure. With more details, more tables with results and samples.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like.",
            "Sure.",
            "So we can. First of all, let me explain that all the experiments that I've conducted so far are run using the ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 data.",
            "Okay.",
            "Actually it's a union of the both collections. That we have, that we produced.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the yes, I have already have some numbers about the tasks and go to some on. Yes, I can, I can extend the slides. The slides sill be extended gradually. It will be gradually extended sure.",
            "Yeah. So this would be very useful. Even for the user and advisory board meeting next Wednesday. And even if then, in the end, I'll tell you: \"Well, let's not present the results, unless someone asked for the arts for that.\" I would like to see the the numbers myself. So that. Yeah. And, to, to put your work on this complex pipeline to the context of others,,, in the team. So PERSON9, PERSON7 and also perhaps PERSON4. I see you four as like potential future competitors in the shared task of ours. And your complex set up, which follows what I outlined. But you can absolute change if if needed, for PROJECT4. That should be one submission. So let's call it a pipeline system. Another system that I still think someone should try again would be the shortcutting, that you had on one of your previous slides. So if you can go back,, there. The idea is that we would simply train neural network, yes? And that would immediately produce the dialogue summarization. This would be an abstractive,, model, very, technically very much similar to sequence to sequence,,, known from machine translation. Except that the goal is to transfer it from the long and noisy English transcript into the short, and concise,, English summary. So I think someone, possibly PERSON7 or PERSON9 should, try or possibly PERSON4, should try this as well. And this is a kind of the abstractive approach. And someone should also try some immediate, like direct,, extractive approach, I would,, suggest. So these are at least three different,, approach is that we should try to run all of them and have them compete in the shared task that we ourselves create. To see, which of the approaches,, is the most viable.",
            "Yes. Sure, I mean. Oh, yes, the the idea to try different different variants, different,, different models. And but.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of course, I said that. The automatic evaluation numbers should be followed by some human evaluation.",
            "Yes.",
            "And the possibility, for example, is to use a kind of use star, stars theme. Like for example one, two, three stars for example.",
            "Yes.",
            "An evaluator, an evaluator will check on the available the summaries. The meeting,, the meeting with the available summary and the generated one. And will have to to to evaluate the scale at which they match each other. Let's say with stars, that one star that is terrible. That is the worst, that is bad, very bad. And the five stars that in that is an excellent matching.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the the design. This is an auto. This is a manual evaluation measure. And exactly as I was telling you at the beginning. We all have to design it. And I, your star system is similar to like to the direct assessment,, that is known from the PROJECT2 machine translation evaluation. But,, I would kind of prefer separate precision and recall in some way. So that,, we would know,, whether all the necess, all important content was captured in the summary. That's the recall. And whether what the summary brings his precise,, in other words, an adequate,, repre, shorter version of what was said.",
            "Oh, yes. Of course.",
            "But this is a. This is to be discussed. So the annotation, the manual scoring has to be fast and easy. And people need to have reasonable agreement,, on that. So,, we need to to do few things. So this is for PERSON8 to to think about. And perhaps for PERSON9 to think about the,, the manual evaluation measure. The details of that, how exactly we want to run it for that. So I think there is lot of input,, and possible tasks for,, each of us. So,. Yeah, it would. We'd just need to divide the work so that we do not duplicate our efforts. But rather a compete, run competing approaches and complement ourselves in all the,, in all the useful,, bits and pieces. And I had one more question. And that was related to the task five point four; the agenda completion. I think that this is a like a possible extension,, in the sense that already at the end of task five point three, you have, the summary of the whole meeting. But you don't have that aligned to the original agenda of that meeting. And,, I think that,, already at the output of five point three. You should be able to measure the similarity of this automatic meeting,, to the,, prepared manual,, summary,, and do other things with that. But obviously, you would not still make the user happy, because you would not to tell him how much of the original agenda was covered. And and, where parts of the original agenda are discussed in in the meetings and so on. Do I understand correctly that this is like this?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the the output of task five point three is already something which essentially PERSON8's annotators are now doing. Because they.",
            "So, in the footage here we have these. You see like. We have these two blocks. And these two blocks have other block. So task five point three gives us a dialogue meeting. And then task three, five point four gives us the filled agenda. So it's very clear like.",
            "So the.",
            "The basic prototype. Taks five point three gives us a dialog meeting and then the agenda will be completed as the filled agenda.",
            "Yeah. So to to to make absolutely clear that. To to make it absolutely clear.",
            "What you said it is correct.",
            "If you remember the screen shot or the screen share that PERSON5 was providing. The transcript is something which is given. So that was the left hand box in that screen shot. And we had the right hand box, and that contained the manual version. And the manual version. My question is: \"Of what?\" Of the output of task five point three or five point four?",
            "The manual minutes you mean?.",
            "Yeah, the manual minutes. There was the manual. So it was like mocking of of faking the the system by doing it by humans. But if it was automatic,, would it be the output of five point three or five point four.",
            "Five point three is the automatic version, the the dialog meeting is produced by task five point three.",
            "Okay. Yeah, yeah.",
            "And then it will be compared. It will be compared with the the manual, the the golden or the reference transcript.",
            "Yes, yes, yeah. Okay, yeah.",
            "For all these meetings that we have.",
            "Yeah, yeah. The current status of your. Thank you,, for the the clarification. So the current status of your implementation and experiments is that you have successfully used the PROJECT1 and ORGANIZATION7 corpora have to go through task five point one. And there you are a quite happy with the segmentation. The segments summarization, you are also kind of happy, because there is plenty of data sets. Or not plenty, but there are some data sets for sentence level compression.",
            "Yes, there are some.",
            "And you are not yet quite happy with the results of five point three, but you have some preliminary outputs.",
            "Yes, yes?",
            "And and so far, we have nothing from five point far,, five point four.",
            "No, nothing from five point four. Or as I said, the the outputs are the the expected expected minutes of the,, the union between ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1. So this data set that is the union of both of them was tested. And the, and the results that that came out from the generative, from the big models. So, were kind of adding in the sense that they didn't really match well. But reference.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "In my experience I reference.",
            "So can you. Can you send us these sample outputs, or maybe if you have them on your machine? Can you directly share them? If it is easy for you to find. So that we see how.",
            "Oh, I don't think it's easy for me to find them right now.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So please, please send them send them later. In the in the coming days, so that we have an impression,, how how bad, the, current outputs are. So what is our starting point. What is our baseline at the moment. And I expect it.",
            "So I will try to put together some samples. Like the reference minutes from ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 and the ones that were produced.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "I will try to put them into alignment together. And so that it's easy to, to see to see the.",
            "Well, send us the source files, because both PERSON9 and PERSON7 should try this exercise of aligning it also for themselves.",
            "Yes.",
            "So you don't have to do it yourself. It will. It will be useful also for both PERSON7 and PERSON9 to, to try it out.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "And for me it would be interesting to compare your outputs for, on the ORGANIZATION7 corpus with the manual summaries. That they have. Did you look at them? You compare the manual summarizations, or or the ORGANIZATION7 summarizations with your outputs?",
            "Yes, as I said. The Rouge scores are low and also the. If you see it, you will see significant differences. The quality differences and the actual.",
            "Yeah, but did you look at them just with your, with the eyes? Are they similar? So what your results and they made.",
            "They had some common words but, I mean, the produced summaries are not correct. From the grammatical point of view. And they just just get some words from the transcript. They are not really. They cannot be considered real minutes. Like.",
            "Yeah. I also think that the quality, the baseline quality would be too bad for for linguist to look at.",
            "Yes, sure. For sure. That's for sure.",
            "Well, but there are actually two points. One thing is that they are not grammatically correct. And the second point is that they are semantically correct. So, the.",
            "Yeah, I I think it would it. They would be actually pretty bad. It will be just the garbage words,, interleaved with some correct words.",
            "Yes, that's exact. And however. Because you should know how Rouge works. However, this creates some, let's say medium level Rouge scores, which are not really representative of the quality of the, of the output.",
            "E So this is why I am again emphasing the fact that the human evaluation is, uh. essential. Should essentially follow the automatic evaluation.",
            "And how it would work this human evaluation. For example, I I would actually I would really like to make this human evaluation myself. But,, maybe we should in invent some measure how I would say how, how I would evaluate it. It is very bad or it's very good.",
            "As I said, the simplest way, the simplest way to do this. And that is also very common method to do this. Is to use the five star scale from one to five starts. So your check both of those text fragments, you check the reference minutes and you check the generated minutes. And you see how they relate together. And you put one if they are like totally. Like the the generated minutes it's it's rubbish. It's totally unrelated to the, to the reference minutes. And you put five if it's related semantically. If first of all if it's grammatically correct and second if it's semantically related to the to the reference minutes in the sence that it it it gives the same information. Like almost the same information in the same,, with the similar length, like with the same concisement, let's say.",
            "Yeah. Maybe it is a good thing to do in September, as we are all in LOCATION1.",
            "Yes, probably yes.",
            "I will, I will meet you and maybe we will try to make this estimation.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "And and the same time. Both PERSON7 and PERSON9 can also contribute ideas on the design of the manual evaluation methods.",
            "Yes, surely.",
            "So Rouge is surely based on some imp.",
            "There are also other. There are.",
            "Yes.",
            "There are also other alter, .alternatives in the literature so. This is very simple what I. This five star. What I'm proposing is very simple to do. But there could be other like,, methods I don't know. Probably invo, involving different evaluators like sharing the the the samples. Or I don't know. Having some integral.",
            "So.",
            "Some agreement between them. Or something like that.",
            "So again, we need a little survey on this. By by someone. If someone can volunteer to provide survey of methods of manual evalution of summaries. That would help us.",
            "Oh, PERSON2. I did. I'm did do the same. And probably I can continue on that.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe just an analysis.",
            "Yeah, that's good.",
            "So I wanted to ask a question PERSON6. That we were trying to, to compare two minutes from semantically. Using an automatic metric. So what what would you suggest for that.",
            "Well, there are different methods for this,, semantic. There are different evaluation possibilities like. The most basic should be the Cosine similarity. You just get the Cosine similarity of different,, corresponding word embeddings and then you have automatic. You have a scale, you have a metric of comparing them. But there are different possibilities. This LDA, LDS, there are different methods that give. That just get the, compare the text and the text, the text fragments and give the scoring as an output. So there are different ways to do that like. LDA is probably one of the most common. Location is one of the most common.",
            "That's probably for the dimensional interaction. So,, that would eventually help. So,,, so,,, -. As you already said, even if we build an automatic metric, we should follow that with an manual metric or manual evaluation by a linguist.",
            "Well I wouldn't say that we will build. We will just use the existing metric like Rouge or Gather like at One or Recall. As PERSON2 said. There is no need to build the whole new metric. We will use the existing metrics and we will have some scores. And as I expect, the Rouge scores are usually very like. Not, there are bad representatives of the quality because they just match the the words. And if there is word repetition or other words we will get Rouge or high Rouge scores. That's. That happens. Which really happens now. And we won't have an idea, the real idea about the quality. So, no matter what metric, what automated metric we use in this task, human evaluation is really necessary.",
            "But if you talk about Rouge it's it's performing good for the for the manual data which,, which is shared by PERSON8. So,, because actually Rouge is actually a word word based metric so,, so I probably don't think that it's going to give us the similarity sense of two the documents. The two minutes.",
            "Yes, maybe.",
            "So it might, it might help the Rouge score if you just have the automatic minuting system and then we compare,, it with the, with the manual one. Then probably we will have higher Rouge scores, in that case Rouge scores will be, will be helpful.",
            "Yes, probably, like, they should be an indication of what to expect.",
            "So yeah, yeah. One more thing PERSON6 I wanted to know. That in this text segmentation, have we used some some tools or is it is it,, is it NLTK or Space _ C or the basic structure like NLT we use when removing words and segmenting.",
            "I guess I just performed the very basic steps like tokenization with Stanford and Coroner LP or. And probably some text cleaning, some basic cleaning. I have to -. I'm I'm not sure about this, I just have to go back to the code. But from the. Like I used. I remember that I used unsupervised. I used clustering methods for this text. You you mean five one, right, text segmentation. I tried clustering algorithms that split everything in sentences and then I tried to aggre to aggregate together the different sentences. On the. Using the Cosine similarity and then trying to cluster together the most similar sentences in the different clusters. This is what I remember for five one.",
            "Okay, so you mean we used Stanford NLP library for, text, for pre-processing of text segmentation.",
            "Yes, I'm not sure about it because I I guess I've implemented myself. Like function that imitates the the Stanford coroner tokenization but is based on Python libraries. Because I'm pretty sure I didn't use Jamba. I have used everything in Python so I've probably used this,, this imitation function that I've created myself. But \"Yes\" in the sense that, from the. It's like very similar to the Stanford Coroner thing.",
            "Okay. Thank you PERSON6. You're welcome.",
            "May I ask you something PERSON6?",
            "Sure.",
            "For the summarization part I just lost connection for a few minutes. Maybe I just missed this information that I want to ask you.",
            "For task five three.",
            "Yeah, five three, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "In that part, which models exactly you've used for that part.",
            "Well I remember I used some big transformer based models.",
            "Transformer?",
            "Yes, transformer based models yes.",
            "Actually there was one that was also based on Burt heavy like really heavy models and of course trained on CNN Daily Mail because I need big data. So yes, I've used some big models like that. Like sequence to sequence matching models, based on transformer. Like they are already available somewhere. I will just find them and I will tell you.",
            "Like what we. So it's like that like existing transformer based architectures.",
            "Yeah, I just wanted to know that. Which ones we tried. And.",
            "Yes. I will just have to find it in the repo and I can tell you.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah, great, thanks.",
            "So if there are no further questions. Then I,, I would like like to ask PERSON8 to present. Probably using the document that we have for this,, call. To present the status of our own data sets.",
            "Okay, just moment over many tried to present in it. But PERSON6 please stop presenting. Otherwise I can't,, begin presenting. PERSON6.",
            "I have to close my slides I guess, right?",
            "No, no, no.",
            "Yes.",
            "Stop presenting is more important.",
            "Stop presenting.",
            "So just escape some. Or leave the full screen mode if you are on there.",
            "You are presenting. Stop presenting. Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Now I can start presenting.",
            "Okay.",
            "Am I presenting?",
            "Not yet. We don't see it yet.",
            "It takes some time. And it says to me that it's waiting.",
            "Maybe waiting for the confirmation of someone?",
            "And or PERSON9, can you?",
            "No, that it asks me,, -",
            "No, I don't think so.",
            "Yeah, it's coming.",
            "Yeah, it's.",
            "Can you see the table?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, we can PERSON8.",
            "Okay. Well, actually I don't have too much to say. More to what is given in the agenda. The data. This is just my table of the annotations. So we can see,, that,. So we annotate English and meetings. There we have,, little bit more meetings for English than for Czech. The total number of hours,, in English is,,,, about ninety two hours, at the moment a little bit more. I haven't put all into the table. It's something a little bit less than one hundred hours of meetings what we have. And for. This is sixty four of our manual transcripts, sixty four meetings transcribed. And, and twenty five of them,, twenty four of them are double transcribed. And we have sixty three minutes generated. So, we have generated minutes for sixty three meetings. And, ss, seventeen of them are doubly minuted. So,, for the time being we,,, sixty five hours transcribed and sixty four hours minuted. That's for English. And for.",
            "Yes, that's what I.",
            "And for Czech, And for Czech we have fifty hours of minute of meetings, and out of that almost,, almost all of our Czech meetings are minuted and transcribed. So about,, so, so, this are the data. And I can show it here. If you, if you look at the agenda, the the numbers are here. So quite a lot of -.",
            "Yeah, that's a great progress. Since the last time,, this was used for the evaluation. So I think it definitely deserves to be converted to the format that PERSON6 can digest. So we can see the Rouge scores for the PROJECT1, ORGANIZATION7 and then PROJECT4 data sets. Because we are in, onthe on the size of of these corpora already.",
            "Yes. And I think. And compared to ORGANIZATION7 and to,, second corpora, corpus we have more minutes, we have more summaries.",
            "Yes.",
            "And some of them are double summaries,, double abstracted and that's what ORGANIZATION7 doesn't have.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I think maybe the quality is also good. Because I even checked the the scores on this data set, I think only on fifteen minutes which PERSON8 did share. So I think we are getting more good score on the one which we have. The data set we have. I think that we don't have PERSON6 with us.",
            "Yeah, it's possible.",
            "It's an empty room.",
            "Yeah. Anyway, we we. I I probably did experiment in this and we do have a better quality then the then the already existing data sets. So,, this data set will give, is giving, more good overall score.",
            "Aha.",
            "Yeah. And,, I wanted to mention to PERSON8 that PERSON10, should later, like within two months from now, probably, get some capacity for PROJECT4. To help us with the final,, the paperwork that needs to accompany this. So that we have all the consense and at the end of the project we can really release clean and safe version of the datasets. So PERSON8, please plan that. Also, please plan that the annotators will be needed later on, during the next year. To do the removal of any personal data from the files. And and all that. So we really have,, the data set that is publishable and it's to the best standards. In this in these terms as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think we have PERSON6.",
            "Yeah. So now I think it is we have covered everything that we needed for this introductory,, call. And I would like to ask,,, PERSON6,, to provide us later on if as I mean, wrong. Now, with summarizing with what we have discussed. But so please correct me. But PERSON6 I would like to the get the scores from you. And the sample outputs. Can someone please record this to the agenda,, of this call,,. So that at the end, we have like a summary of what, what people should do. So PERSON6 to provide us with the sample outputs,, the scores, so that we will also see what you already know that medium Rouge scores, actually easily correspond to very bad outputs. We need to have the same,, knowledge, the same experiences as you already have. And I would like. You were, you were not present here PERSON6. I would like to ask you you to, to tell us what is needed so that you can redo your experiments, also with our own English data,, and maybe even the,, Czech data. So be. So that is what is the way that you are using the ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 corpora. Do you split it into training and test set? Or do you only use it as the test?",
            "No, it's only test sets.",
            "Only test sets? Yeah. So that means that your methods are dependent on the so whatever,, you CNN Daily Mail.",
            "Daily Mail, yeah.",
            "CNN Daily Mail. And that means that you cannot easily use it. Well, you could. You you could use it also for Czech, but not a transferring from CNN Daily Mail, but transferring from Sumecek.",
            "Yes.",
            "So have you heard of Sumecek?",
            "No, but I guess it's something that i can learn.",
            "That's a that's a corpus that has been developed by PERSON1 and colleagues. It's on PROJECT3 if I'm not mistaken. So search,, PROJECT3 out for, like,, as I write it, S-U-M-E,, Sume Sumecek. Which is a name of a fish in in a Czech language. And this could be the,, training data. It's,, news,,,, articles and and titles, and you could train a similar style of summarization, the components as you did for the English. So I would like you to evaluate, your pipeline,, in its current status. Each of its components on the English part of PROJECT4,, summarization test, the summarization,, data set. And,, if you could retrain that a pipeline on Sumecek and try it on the Czech summaries that PERSON8 is collecting. And this can easily involve,. So so the training is on you. It is obviously something which will take weeks. It is not something that will be done within days.",
            "No, it takes like. I guess it takes four or five days. Maximum.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So.",
            "It's supposed to be faster than on my laptop. Because.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And, it will also need probably some conversion of the format from the current status of the summaries and transcripts to what you expect. So,, if PERSON4,, would have the capacity, then I think that PERSON4 could help you in This conversion. So that you get faster that.",
            "Because the new data of PERSON8, I think they are they are in the plain text. They are not in XML.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, but still. They they have to be converted to the items as you expect of them, probably. So there,, I assume that some conversion may be necessary. So it's. I'm, yeah, you have. You have look at the data, and you will say. And I'm I'm putting this as a question to to PERSON4. If he would have any capacity now on,, for working on this. And, if if he has the capacity. Then yes, this is an an option for you to,, to get faster to to that result. But it is it depends on, PERSON4, obviously. And it primarily need depends on the need,, of of this conversion. So that will,, be the the pipeline system. As I said. And PERSON7 is still busy with finishing his thesis is in the coming weeks. So will I do not expect much of progress from PERSON7 on his own models until September starts,? And but but please try to,, work on the the task proposal, or watch a proposal. And and so on. And,, for PERSON9, you will be or you are already in close touch with PERSON8. And,,, you are quite free to choose what you would like to work on, um. as the first thing. But you are kind of already working on the similarity,,, measures. So try to look at the data again. Try to come up with the automated measures. Maybe the abstract, abstractiveness and extractiveness could be, could be a first,,, easy to reach stepping stone. Like an intermediate goal.",
            "So hi PERSON2. Can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I just want to from you. So, we are going for the for joint corpora workshop, right?",
            "Well I don't know what joint simply. Yes, cort, cor. Yes, so joint you mean all ICL.",
            "Yeah, I mean I mean. Yeah, yeah. So you know like for every workshop we have. Tuesday meetings.",
            "Yes, let's definitely go. Let's - Yes, let's definitely go for this.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And and I remember that you mentioned Ed Howe and another colleague that you could get in touch. So that we would get the sence of the D.U.C. conferences.",
            "Yes, yes, yes I will do that.",
            "And their results so there is nothing form the past,, that is important and we may forget.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "And, so,, when I was suggesting that PERSON9 is,, kind of free to chose what to do. PERSON9,, you could be the person, in addition to abstractiveness extractiveness,, you could look at the,,, the, the, as as PERSON6 put it, the shortcutting of the approach. So you could try training,, sequence to sequence models based on your machine translation experience. To do the direct cut. But this is again something that will take some time. So just keep thinking about it for two more weeks and only then,, start asking about the technical details. Like how to use our cluster, and and all that. So this is just for you think,,, a little bit ahead,, for. And think how to do it how to how to convert, modify the machine translations toolkits so that they,, will easily digest the different data and and all that.",
            "Yes, surely PERSON2. And I will,, consider this option. First I finish with this automatic metric. I think it will take,, two weeks to finish it up.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Task which PERSON8 is expecting from me so. And then I'll probably experiment with the sequence to sequence models which PERSON6 give us an option with.",
            "Yes, okay, great. So I think,, this was very successful first meeting,, and I suggest that we close it for now. And I would like to have one such similar meeting again in say early September. So on the eight of September,, there is the official review of the whole PROJECT4 project. So this is something,, that we will be working for. We need to prepare the slides, twenty minutes per work package. So this will be for PERSON8 and PERSON6 a lot of work. So you won't hear from us,, until we are like safely behind this. But after after the eight of September I think it will be a good timing,, to,, to run another such joint big meeting. And I would like to hear from PERSON4, if he would have any capacity on this. And I would like to to hear from PERSON7 where he would be going to. And from PERSON9 what what would be your next steps and and,, so on. So,, let's let's have this timeframe in in our minds.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay? So, if you don't have any further questions,, then,, that's that's great. And we'll be in touch by email. And I would like to just double check with our remote colleagues. So PERSON9 what is the time in the day, when you have like your daily slot,, for for quick chats.",
            "So, so PERSON8 and I have checked timing. I don't know which timing is that for LOCATION1. PERSON8 which time is that we have for LOCATION1? Do I PERSON2 the entire day? So,",
            "So we just said it would be at 2 A.M.,.",
            "Well 2 A.M no.",
            "Sorry. Two o'clock in the afternoon according to the LOCATION1 time. I have no idea what time is it in.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, so it's. It's six for me so it's it's probably fine for me. So I am available the entire day. So whenever I need PERSON8 I do message her. So probably you can also message me. We do usually chat and hangouts, so.",
            "Yeah, so the idea is that you have. This is the same thing we also should have with PERSON7, once he is on the project.",
            "I'm. May I just. May I just interrupt it for a minute?",
            "Yeah.",
            "May I just go out. I really. My children need me really, really for half and hour. For last half an hour. May I just -.",
            "Yeah. I think, I think that we are finished. So thank you PERSON8. And that's,, that's it. Thanks for your contribution to this and and like take care of your kids. And we'll be in touch later on.",
            "Thank you everybody for taking part in the meeting. And I will address you later. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",
            "Thank you. Thank you. So let me just finish the idea of these daily meeting slots. So PERSON7,, the agreement that we made. That we make with all remote colleagues is that we agree with them on some particular slot in the day,, where there is one person from the LOCATION1 team. So for PERSON9 it is PERSON8. At that slot the the people every day will will meet. And that's the equivalent of like running into each other on the corridor or going for a coffee after the lunch. And the,, the point of this is is is that you feel like a part of the team and that you are never lost. Never,, like let,,,, never left sitting with with a problem. And that you can every day like quickly ask for help. Obviously,, the help will not always come. But,, at least you have a chance to say. And we have you in in the team. So it's,,, 2 PM LOCATION1 time for PERSON9. If that fits well you, then you could join these as well. You can join them right now already or you can join these chats,,,, later on. When you are like free from your thesis. And,, for PERSON4, if you would have the capacity, then you could also,, try these,, regular regular chats. So,, just let PERSON8 and PERSON9 know,, whether, both, Tuta PERSON7 and PERSON4, let them know if you would like to,, join these chats. And they will,, tell you how how they meet. Because technically the the remote calls,,, are sometimes too bad so so text chatting is,, is safe, seems safer sometimes.",
            "And PERSON2 shared documents I guess. That's helpful.",
            "Yes. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So thanks to all. I don't have, I don't have anything further to say. So then you very much and we'll be in touch,, later on, right? Any comments from your side? So if, if there're none then then again thank you and I'm very happy with the progress that we made today. Okay. Thanks.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Nothing from me.",
            "Yeah, PERSON7 this reminds me of the transcript. Did you manage to get the automatic transcript for the from the plug-in?",
            "Bye, bye. Thank you.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. I'll email you separately. Bye, bye.",
            "Yes, I have that meeting. Yes, yes, yes.",
            "So please send it by email to me and PERSON8.",
            "Okay. Bye bye."

            "Yes.",
            "And they disconnect and that makes a separate recording.",
            "Yes, it happens frequently. I'm used to that. I'm just de deleting. I I I will delete the short files.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Hi, PERSON6. I see that you're here great.",
            "Hi. Well actually, when we are four we c we can begin. Discussing the evaluation, because everyone did do that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "He considered that that it had no sense that we can easily begin to do that.",
            "Yeah. So, let's let's start. And I have time only until two sharp. And I'll follow.",
            "Me too.",
            "So please share the screen with me. And like discuss what these I'll I'll just keep listening.",
            "Well. I think that we maybe we will start discussing eva the evaluation beginning from minutes zero two and I will share the screen. With the alignment. So so I will do the following things. Maybe it will be easier then. So.",
            "And and PERSON8 I would. PERSON8 I would propose that like we would specifically be critical of every minute. And try to note down the disadvantages that are there. Or the shortcomings in each of the meetings.",
            "Yes. The question is how we do that. If we write it down. If I write it down.",
            "I let me let me write it down. I will write down in my notebook. And then I will like make a summary and.",
            "Yes. Thank you very much. Because when I'm sharing the screen, it would be kind of complicated to write down at the same time.",
            "Yeah. I will do that. I will do that.",
            "Thank you very much. I will also make some notes on on the paper. But if you can do that thank you very much.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I will do that.",
            "I cannot I cannot share the screen, PERSON3.",
            "Oh. Yeah.",
            "Enable participant screen sharing.",
            "That's strange. S. S okay I see. So I made you co-host. But somehow it was lost. I don't know.",
            "I'll try it.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, it now it's possible.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "So. Can you see the screen now?",
            "Yes.",
            "Perfect. And now I here we have the transcript. And I open the minutes zero two now. And I would like to ask some of you for example PERSON9. Find start with the saying advantas advantages and disadvantages for them. And we will then see or s. So here are the minutes, PERSON3 if you.",
            "And here is the transcript. But this is on my screen so you cannot.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So as per my as per my like evaluation goals. Meetings minute two is detailed. And it is also grouped as per topics that we agreed in our last meeting that they should be like that. And. But I think for starting for starting topics it was done in a greater detail. For example, the ISWLT presentation. So I thought some of the information were could be could could not appear in the minutes. Those are not that much required. And I also found that some like some instances for correctness. I don't know where was the power outage happened. Does did it happen at ORGANIZATION4? Or did it happen at ORGANIZATION7? So from.",
            "The the power outage was actually planned. And it one power outage at kad i ORGANIZATION7. And and another was planned at ORGANIZATION4. So it.",
            "Okay. Okay. So from the from the minutes it appear that the power power of this happened at ORGANIZATION7. And because of that and and and and because of that. There were some precautions to be taken for the for the next. Meeting. Meeting. And then I found a small like maybe spelling mistake. So it was internal which should be. And again another inconsistency that I found. I don't know if it's characterized. Like in the in the minute it was said update to their workers. But I think.",
            "Like we the idea was to replicate the system at cross various sites. And like prevent any update to the system. Two weeks before the demo. So that those are those are not like inconsistent doing the actual demo. So yeah. So this could be some factual inconsistencies. As far the original transcript. Other ways the minutes is detailed. Sometimes too much detailed. But okay.",
            "So here we have to come with something like. Like in summarization. The rule of thumb is your summary should be less than 50% of the actual document.",
            "So, it's a rule of thumb. Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So here we have to come to that decision what should we like the constrained for the maximum length of the minutes.",
            "Well I think that this is not just problem with the length. But the length combined with inconsistencies. Because later we would have other minutes that are more detailed. But more str but better structured. And better understood transcript. And then we d. I didn't have the impression of to of unnecessary details. Because there were also kinda a lot of amount big amount of details. But they were consistent. And they seemed to be mo much more relevant. So it's really. So I I think each special feature if if each special each special feature of the minute is important. But they begin to be more drastic when they play together. So then when the minutes is very short. And incorrect. It's much worse than it is just short but correct. Or or or maybe ifs they're long but incorrect. It's better than they're short and incorrect. Because sometimes they kind of match some details. But otherwise, yes. Yes yes, it's very it's very important with this length. Did you finish or do you have any other?",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I think this is the like evaluation. From my end.",
            "Yes.",
            "Maybe PERSON6, could you continue? I will I probably be the third one in this case.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "I can see you. It's very very very very.",
            "Huh. We can't see. You're very very silent.",
            "Actually. In my hometown and I did not bring my. So let me login through my phone.",
            "PERSON6, I can't hear you. I don't know what what about all of you. PERSON3, and and. PERSON9, can you hear PERSON6?",
            "No, it's very.",
            "No, no. PERSON6, can you can you. Are you using Windows? Or what what system are you using? PERSON6? Are you still here?",
            "I think PERSON6 will now repeat with.",
            "Reconnect? Reconnect with one more device. Pr. Does that. She she is using the computer now. And she is badly audible. And she will reconnect with her iPhone.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I hope. Anyway, maybe in the meanwhile I will I may say my evaluations.",
            "Yes. Please.",
            "What I noticed different from other minutes here is that she kind of summarized it twice. So first, it was summarization like objectives of the meetings. Here. And she listed almost consequently so the annotator listed almost consequently the five main topics. And then these topics were once more d more more more were summarized in more detail in the. So actually this was a problem when aligning. Because either I align these five sentences to the whole transcript. Or I align these separate sentences with with the whole transcript. And when I did it, I kind of combined the alignment, because sometim. But I understand the very very subjectivity of such alignment. So.",
            "Yeah, so the.",
            "Just.",
            "W like the question is whether we do want to allow many to many alignments. Because if we do allow many to many align.",
            "Now it doesn't. Now it is not allowed. Because the tool doesn't allow it allow that.",
            "Yeah. So if we if we want to, we could allow it. And then there would not be any problem. You would have like for the first summary. The choosing the new dates or whatever. That that single line in the summary will me mapped to the whole thing. And then when there is the details about this choosing of the new dates. You would be aligning individual lines there.",
            "So -",
            "Yeah, technically it's all decidable. Just I noticed that. So these case was just in this minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That it was summarized twice. But it can happen in real minutes, of course. So I do not I do not expect that automatically recreated minutes.",
            "Will have that.",
            "Will be like that.",
            "But they they they could have that. I'magine they we would have that would say how much do we want to summarize it. And we would first run with the like tightened knob. And then and then less so tight.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "That and from the very uninformed person. It actually helped me. To to read first read this high level summary and then the details. But yeah. I'll I'll I don't want to stop your evaluation.",
            "Yes. Definitely it helps. Or I agree. It helped also me by when I evaluated it. Because the list that follows is really looks kind of messy in some aspects. Especially it was near the annotator did not understand all the points. For example, she didn't understand that we were discussing deliverables. And reviews to all deliverab. So she didn't put together all the deliverables that were discussed. Because they were discussed some NLP report and who does the review for that report. And then w other topics for an for from for each the reviews wer. Searched. And she didn't put that together. Sh so she didn't understand it. It is clear from the minutes that she didn't understand it. And so generally the detailed part contains a number of contentual mistakes. But otherwise. It is detailed and structures structured. And many many sentences that are included are correct and important. So did. From my point of view it was just find it somewhere just a moment where I have it. Okay I will find it later. After PERSON6's presentation.",
            "Yeah. Can you hear me now?",
            "Yes.",
            "Is it is it audible? Yes.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah. So I logged in from my phone. Okay so. The weakness which I found in this presentation. There are some sentence which are incomplete. For example I would like to refer to the sentence like features working on. So what features are we talking about. And what are we gonna work on, like. So it is not clear syntax.",
            "PERSON6, could you could you speak slower? Because your phone is self-muting itself. And like your sp. If you speak slower, it will be it will be much easier to understand.",
            "Okay. Okay. So the I actually the minute is at a lack the correctness, maybe? If I call that. So some sentences are incomplete. If you refer to sentence like implemented features. And now working on. In the minute, can you just?",
            "Features and now working on. Yes. The last part of the details.",
            "Yes. Yes. Yes. So i so it is not clear actually wha. We are talking about. Which features. Which features are we talking about.",
            "Well. These are the features. The regular testing,. The log dirs,. It's actually log, and not lock. But that's okay.",
            "So, i. So from the sentence it is it is not clear I felt like that. If you read the sentence. It it will not be clear that. What are the features we are talking about. And what is someone working on. So what we working on right now? So it is only return that now working on. So I felt like this is an incomplete sentence. Which something something is missing. And then. There the topics are all seems to be cau seem to be covered here. And. Is also is captured. Thought it is seeming to be a good minute. And. But there are actually some grammatical mistakes. And some as I mentioned that some sentences are not making a sense. They're not complete. I also saw one more sentence which had grammatical mistake. And it is so. Yeah, I think experience with demo. Yeah.",
            "So if if I may comment.",
            "Huh.",
            "So. Well. Thanks to all for for their work. And their their observations. I think that for example. Dwelling on the grammatical mistakes would be w the wrong idea. I think that if we were to distinguish the different meetings. The grammaticality would be among the last criterions. Of importance. For for the application. So we should focus on the information preservation. And like.",
            "Yes.",
            "Whether it is understandable. And it's interesting how we all will differ in what we find understandable. And not understandable. So well. I was at the meeting obviously. But implemented features and now working on. For me this is sufficient. And clear. Because I had the background knowledge.",
            "You know which features.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I know which features. And I know that we're discussing the features which are already implemented. And the features which are still not implemented.",
            "So when you look at the you like it.",
            "So, yes, I'm I'm happy with this sentence. With this half-sentence.",
            "Generally meeting. Generally, the whole minute.",
            "Well I haven't read it in in the full detail.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'll I de I definitely like the summary at the top. And I s then for the for the details.",
            "So the question is.",
            "There is some there is some hierarchy in that. Which is great. And obviously the meeting was not as structured as as we would like it to to be. So the annotator did fairly good job. Given the the messy input.",
            "Yes, definitely.",
            "Just a quick question. In the general general summary on on on the top. Choosing new dates to give to the project officer. Would you. Would you not consider it to be too general?",
            "I. I would. Except that maybe the dates were not.",
            "So the date of what kind of someth. Something like. So this is probably the one thing in this general thing that.",
            "It's actually missing in the details. I think there is no detailed.",
            "Detailed descrip. Because it was not really clear. Who is the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So in in in the meeting itself, it was. It was just said once. But everybody considered it to to be important. And in almost in all meeting it's somehow written.",
            "New date.",
            "But it was one sentence.",
            "And I see okay. It's because postponed till September. And I see more people finally vote it. So. So maybe. Oh, we have ORGANIZATION6, we have PERSON7. So maybe there's a chance to pick a date. I know what has been happening there. So it was just a reminder for everybody to fill the Doodle poll.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's yeah.",
            "And one more sentence. If you can see in discussing how the presentation will be carried out. There is a sentence in that. The video will display the demo of the system live subtitling chosen video. So is that sentence making a sense to you? Because it does not making a sense to me maybe.",
            "Yeah. It is fully correct for me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So I have that video, but I I I cannot recall.",
            "The the v. So the the it's hard to parse. The the video will show.",
            "So the video will contain a demo. Of the system. As it is doing live subtitling of some other chosen video.",
            "So it is it is perfect.",
            "Except that is it's very complicated. Because. Yeah.",
            "Well. I really like like listening to that. Because when I was doing the evaluations. I game came to the idea that it is very important that the is in the topic or out of the topic. And but now I see one more aspect. That it also important for the reader. If the reader is in topic or not in topic. So it's really hard.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "Okay. So let's go father. I ca. I suggest that we move.",
            "So I think I think the important thing that comes out from the discussion is like who is the audience who will read.",
            "Yes,.",
            "Yes, definitely. Definitely. This is. But this is unfortunately it's different. First. So from very aspects it's different. So real minutes are also prepared for for different purposes. So sometimes they are made for something somebody who hasn't been at the meeting. Sometimes for himself. Sometimes for the group who was who were attending the minutes the meetings. And also our data are constructed like that. But even if they if we take s just one group. And even if it has just one purpose. It still may not reach this purpose. So as in the ORGANIZATION1 data they kind of make minutes for people who haven't been at the meeting. Kind of also. But they don't reach this purpose. So the people. So we do not really understand in many many case what they didn't what they did. So it's really. We understand the purpose. So we understand this differences. But we cannot but we cannot make it.",
            "Make it happen achieve them.",
            "We can we can't really achieve them so easily. Let's move to the next one. So we don't have so many so much time. We are just at the first one. Minutes zero three. PERSON9 could you say something to that?",
            "Just a second. Okay.",
            "I ha.",
            "So, yeah. So according. Yes. So according to me. The minutes was too short. It was kind of abstractive. The minute was not exhaustive. But although it touched the importance of things that were discussed.",
            "So I I the minute you know. And I found lots of mistakes of me. When I was evaluating it.",
            "So I. So yeah. So this is just my evaluation. So it was although it touched on the majority of the topics. But it was not exhaustive. And it was not informative. And it was and it was done from an abstracted point of view. And it was too short.",
            "So I also wanted this case what idea I ha I had in my mind. When I was making it. So I had that what if we look after some time like one or two months. And we get to know. Okay, what was what were the key points what were discussed. And what does need to be done. So I thought that and made that these points. But now when I was evaluating. So I came to the the point like there there s few things that were discussed are still missing here. And when I eva. So it it actually differs from the perspective when you evaluate. So.",
            "So I have one observation here. This summary is also like two steps. Like two levels. There is the line may main points of the discussion. And that lists the high level summary. And then there are details to these to this high level summary.",
            "So it's also two level thing. We just it's just formatted differently. So you do not realize it's like that. And it's much much shorter than the previous summary. But at the same. I see some errors. For example, that the people don't know that IWSLT is spelled one way or another, that's okay. That was also in the previous one. When when reading the minutes you have to be very flexible. With respect to the precise wording. Also there here is a mistake like project officer needs to be doodled new dates. That is very ambiguous with respect like who has to learn what or on or whether he has to. But. There is at least some indication that some dates of the review are are needed. So that was correctly captured. And the thing is that this message is is readable. And f. In retrospect, like when wh depending on the purpose of the meeting. When you come to this purpose of the minutes. When you come to this, you realize we were discussing the dates. And then you can figure out from the transcript what exact what exactly was said. Or you can ask people. So this this summary serves the purpose. For both from people from the outside and people in the in the in the meeting itself. And and PERSON6 you also mentioned that we should come back to these meetings after a few months. This is what happened this is what is happening to me at the moment.",
            "This is after few months of of that meeting. And I fully understand all the details. I cannot speak about completeness. So f if I was given only this short summary, I would never be sure if if it contained everything we discussed. But what it mentions. I documents and reviewer. And I know what that means. So I know this that this is for example this is hard for you to interpret. Dealing with deliverables by shared ORGANIZATION2 documents and reviewer. What is this and reviewer?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I know.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "I know what.",
            "Yes. Yeah. Yeah. PERSON8 and I were discussing it the other day. That this line is actually not making a the correctness is not delivered in the sentence.",
            "So it is not seeming to be complete.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So what kind of deliverables and what kind who are the reviewers? So the reviewers are someone in the project. I remember from the meeting. And so for the deliverables. I I you mentioned reviewers. So it is talking about that. But the sentence is not making sense here. Actually.",
            "So the sentence would be understandable to someone who has read the full transcript.",
            "Yes.",
            "And or someone who was at the meeting, obviously. But it would not be understandable to someone external.",
            "And I'm also thinking like PERSON11 in his e-mail today. He said that if we are going for these short bulleted points. Then we can easily achieve them with existing methods. So I PERSON11 please do so. Please please could you run some of these methods on this particular transcript. And give us the the bullet points or keywords that that it would extract for you? Please do so. This is this you should have done that already by yourself. So that we could see that type of automatic meeting summary baseline. So if if it's easy then please do it. So PERSON11 are you on the call?",
            "Yes. I mean it's definitely much more easier than the other way around. But yes. I will just have to look around. And make sure and see.",
            "Yeah. Please please do it do it even.",
            "Best way.",
            "Yeah, please do it within a week. Or or less. Bif it's like if if you j if you can run one of your existent modals, please do so. We want to see these outputs as well. They will be radically different from the human summaries. And we want to see in which way they are like acceptable. And in which ways.",
            "Huh. There was. There won't be significant difference from the summaries that I saw. There will be just.",
            "Then show me. I I want to see them. I really want to see them.",
            "Yes. They they they should be bullet points that we that.",
            "I'm really curious about it. If that is the case. Then yes, that's that's perfect. Let's let's run them. For the share task. And yeah. Maybe they will score great. So it's yeah.",
            "Maybe if we are here at the discussing the difference between crea bullet points created by by humans and created by automatic system. Let's compare minutes zero five.",
            "Okay.",
            "Look at zero zero five. And le then minutes zero nine.",
            "Okay.",
            "So let's see minute zero.",
            "Let's do let's do five. Yeah, so who can walk us through.",
            "I'm opening five. So. I consider. So I. So my evaluation of of these minutes are probably the best. Because.",
            "I as I as I looked at the relative. So I it's the amount of data and the correctness of data from the point of view of the content. And how. Sorry.",
            "It's my class with piano. Just a moment.",
            "PERSON8 you have to.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yeah, you have to you have to quit your Skype application. Otherwise there is a risk that the it will still call you on on this machine. I had that conflict as well. So just quit Skype.",
            "Who knows how to do that. Anyway, probably they will call by Whatsapp, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay that's.",
            "Just my son has a piano class. The piano from this room. Because of this.",
            "In minutes minutes 5 there is also this double.",
            "Yes, yes. This is assured. Yes, yes. This is assured. But.",
            "There is a top level summary anyway.",
            "Well the difference is that. Okay. And I did want to. Yes, there is often this that short line. But in that case w. Just. S. Anyway. I don't. So technical details. Let's not do that now. But let's look at the detailed minutes now. And. So I considered it the most understood. So I considered that the annotator understood the content. And at the same time gave quite a lot of practical information inside into into the minutes. So I was really able to understand what was going on as not being a participant with the meeting. It was clear. And the decisions were kind of put together with the information. Not just a list of decisions. But it was given the topic and the decision matched to that topic. So for me. As a human, not participant of the meeting.",
            "PERSON8.",
            "Meeting eight?",
            "Five.",
            "Fi, five. Meeting five.",
            "Okay.",
            "Five, okay.",
            "Five.",
            "But PERSON8 you also mention about meeting nine. Is that.",
            "After that.",
            "After after the one. So now five. And then nine.",
            "Now we're doing five. Now we are doing five.",
            "Okay.",
            "So this is my evaluation. Please say somebody something. Maybe PERSON6. Could you gave give your evaluation?",
            "Yes, so the same sentence we were looking at the other meeting. Here also the postpone review. So doodle with voting for a new date. Possible to decide already now. So. So this is also seeming not to make much sense. As in the last last minute as well.",
            "So.",
            "Well. I I yeah. It totally makes sense to me. I fully understand it.",
            "I absolutely. Yeah.",
            "S. Okay. So yeah. So yeah. Though I know that okay. You were supposed to doodle new dates because of postponing to the to the to the officer. And you ask PERSON4 for that. So I remember what was the conversation. So but I the sentence is not making much sense. And thought it is it is covering almost everything. All it is readable. And it is seeming to be much informative. And it is clear what is exactly derived in the entire meeting. And. The the drawbacks which I felt were. They were some as I said that they were some sentence like the last sentence. To send IWSLT findings PDF to partners. So.",
            "Perfect to me. I would not fix anything. To send the PDF of IWSLT findings. Yeah. It's.",
            "Okay. So y. Yeah. So I I don't know the PDF of the finding. Like.",
            "The finding is acish actually was capital F. So that's the result. That's the report with the.",
            "Huh.",
            "With all the findings. So that's the background knowledge that I have.",
            "Okay. So I did not have that.",
            "And PERSON9?",
            "Yeah. I felt the meeting too was like on topic. And it did a fair amount of job to summarize what has been discussed. And like some some the discussion like for example why you need to extend the project. So. That discussion was like is missing for this. Yeah, like I find extension of the project. So why are we like asking for extension?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that review was definitely discussed in the transcript. In the meeting.",
            "Yes.",
            "But from there it is not coming up clear.",
            "Yes.",
            "But I think it was not finalized, was it? I think because of COVID. PERSON3 mentioned in that meeting. But was it finalized?",
            "Yeah, PERSON3 men. No, it was not finalized. But.",
            "At least one mention of COVID.",
            "Yes, it was mentioned.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But it is not mentioned in the minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, it could be mentioned. I also thought about this.",
            "But even it was not decided for the months as well. So somebody said six months we can extend. Somebody said. So PERSON3 said two to three months only I can only maybe extend it. So they all discussed that. So it was also not decided toward three months.",
            "So I think I think this comment would have been easily resolved. Like if the annotator would have written extension of the project due to COVID.",
            "So with this phrase. This. This comment would have been -",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And else, I too find that like. To some extent this sounds very like. The way we would like to see a minute. Also, there are some some very minor mistakes. Like it is written Bibtech, it should be like BibTeX. I I'm familiar with this thing. It might be that the annotator is not familiar. And.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, this is my evaluation. So it it is really good.",
            "Yeah, thank you for that. And I also think that this. Using these minutes, I tried to think about measures. And about which criteria I use. And I realized that these minutes are good from the point of view of correctness. So the statements are mostly correct. Up to except of these very minor things we have note we have mentioned now. They they are relevant. So they are mo put to the topic. Most information from the transcript is covered. But so this coverage is here very important. It is readable for me as not participants of the meeting. It was it could be also kind of criticized in by other meetings minutes we have looked at now. That they're not readable for for everybody. And they're also informative. This is also kinda good point for this and for motiv. Because if we compare. If we take other good summary. For example that one that coherent one minute minute four. By PERSON11. They're also correct. Relevant. And readable. And the difference is in informativeness. So it's. So this is just my considerations about measurements. So when I. So looking at the comparing these minutes I tried to thou think about criteria I could evaluate them. And this this was my ideas of correctness, relevance, coverage, readability and informativeness. So thank you. And let's now look at zero nine. What do you think about zero nine? So. PERSON9?",
            "So are we skipping some minutes in between maybe?",
            "Yes, zero nine. Now zero nine.",
            "Yes. Skip skip to skip to zero nine.",
            "Okay. Just a second. Yeah. So I found that the meeting is not informative. For for for for a certain participant. Whe was not in the meeting. Because there were too many empty elements. That was not comprehensible. And then. Some information was not correct. As far as far the understanding of the transcript.",
            "And. Yeah. So b as we discussed it the grammaticality does n doesn't very play a very important role. It should come at last. So from that extent it is okay. But there are. Like to a person who was not there in the meeting. It is not informative correctness question. It also boils down. So. Yeah. So. That's my evaluation for this.",
            "Thank you. May I ask maybe PERSON3 what do you think about that?",
            "Yeah. Yeah I totally agree. So this this summary is is as from all that I have seen so far the worst one. Because it is not structured according to the topics. It is not like restructured. The meeting was messy. But many of the minutes were successfully recovering the hierarchical structure from that. And this one doesn't recover it. This one is like more sequential. And the statements are abbreviated in in a way which sometimes obscures the the meaning. Like picking the best system.",
            "You don't know whether the system was picked or whether it was discussed how to pick the best system. I'm I'm sure that there was much more details on on this in the in the transcript. Before.",
            "You don't know which system.",
            "Yeah, you d. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So d this is like key words or selected words from the corresponding span of of the transcript. Without actually understanding what has happened in the discussion.",
            "So this is. Yes. This is could be something that would come the system.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "So probably. So I really included this minute. The I as the first one. This is very strange annotator. Here but. But I don't want to give him away totally, because he's constantly like a step between automat and.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly. I think it's -",
            "Creation.",
            "Half a robot.",
            "Yes. And really definitely say him I don't want him. Because sometimes I really want to see something like example of badly badly created minutes. And I especially asked him to do that.",
            "Asked him to do that badly.",
            "Especially for our evaluations. I gave him the meetings. So that so that we have this downfall. So I think that when PERSON11 comes with something bullet points we can compare it compare it also to that.",
            "Just yes. Just.",
            "There are also errors here. Like must have.",
            "A lot of.",
            "Replicate components. Across the site. It's actually across the sites. So across the multiple. And and then changes the meaning of that message.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that's why I'm like it it it's a small thing. It's a typo missing plural indication. But it actually affects the meaning. So that's why I'm picking it up.",
            "And also some spelling mistakes, like submitions. You can see.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Bibtech as well. Again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is something that I didn't understand myself. A website has been created from Bibtech.",
            "Yeah. What does that mean?",
            "I can't relate. Can't relate that. But that has actually. It has a messa. It has a meaning. So I can imagine that a website would be created from some Bibtech file. But I doubt that this was discussed.",
            "You didn't told that. No you didn't sa.",
            "No the discussion was actually about that we are supposed to collect all the references in one at one place.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And t we were discussing the place where to keep them. And PERSON3 mentioned that Bib whether we should keep that in BibTeX formator something like that. So. The collection format was discussed. And it is mentioned that all that site was created and. It doesn't make any sense.",
            "Oh. Well. Someone says that, actually.",
            "Huh.",
            "So if you search for the word website in the transcript. Then who who is that? So will remember that in such as you've asked us for BibTech entry. And I don't know what he did that with. So. Okay, so I created the website from BibTech which was okay. There was some style but then we had to put ended up. Yep yep yep yep. So I now know what is happening. It it was me talking to PERSON2 on the call. And i yes. The the statement in the summary which says a website has been created from BibTech. That is actually to true statement. But such a web. It was a webpage, not a website. But never mind. PERSON2 said website. And it was for one of the past projects. So it is like saying that yes. Yes it's technically possible. We did it in the past. Or PERSON2 did it in the past. T he he created a website from BibTech. But it's not related. So the. The coreference or the understanding of the relation of the of the entities in this sentence. The website and and the BibTech. These are totally badly assigned when a person reads the summary now. So if you read the summary now and you read website has been created from BibTech. You would assume that for this project some webpage was created from BibTech entries. And that's not the case. The way the way it was discussed here website is that okay so I created the website from BibTech which was okay. There was yeah. So that's a maybe it's not understandable from from the transcript. Maybe it's understandable only from the from the sound and maybe not even that. That it's two different per people. And I'm asking PERSON2 about his way of handling the publications. And he said yes. We collected BibTeX. And I created a web page from those. And that worked. And then he goes on which is the more important message. That it was difficult to enter these details then to the system. So the the this is so this summary has picked up random point. Which is of the lowest priority here. Of the lowest importance. And it forgot some more important points. So that is something also like I don't know like. It's not out of proportion, but unbalanced. Let's call it unbalanced summarization?",
            "But interesting that a human being has created it. So it. He really somehow overlooked what is important is important and what is not important. He has created a list of something. So it's really interesting to compare it with something automatically created. Criteria of that are being catched or not being catched by the by the program.",
            "Yeah. So ideally I would imagine that there is some like hierarchy of. That there is a set of pieces of information. And there is hierarchic of importance in these. In the ideal platonic world. And if if the reader is able to understand the the the transcript so that they assign this importance to to each of these pieces of information. Then you can like select the size of the of the summary. And include the top scoring pieces of information into that summary. But this is the ideal world. And it is not possible. Very often it is not possible to extract this this level of importance. In the from the transcript or from the recording. I ca I can understand that even a human would not be able to to identify that. This remark that he created a website it's it's it's not important. And the fact that it was a lot of work to convert the BibTech to this is more important for for this particular project.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Maybe we can shortly look at one more minute. Minute zero eight.",
            "So I would just give a little theoretical introduction. That the creator of the minutes he's doing it half professionally.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "So this is the person that is worki. So really worked with minutes creat as a minutes creator. And hired for that and paid for that. Not for our meetings. But generally. For other meetings. And just w I'm. Eager to hear what your h s evaluation on that. Could you give me some PERSON9 please?",
            "Yeah, okay. So I will go first. So the meeting is on topic. It is grouped. It is but to some extent it is too much detailed. That has been manifested over here from the transcript. And the sometimes some not very relevant information has crept in. In that so which which are not very much relevant for someone who reads the minutes later. There were some spelling mistakes. But those are not very important. And again, yeah. So yeah, grammatically inconsistent. So that is not a criteria. And most importantly some of the sentences like some of the information were redundant.",
            "Were replicated like mi many times inside the minute. Otherwise it is okay. But I would rate meeting five higher than this.",
            "You you have read what? Sorry?",
            "Rate. Score.",
            "I would rate.",
            "Huh.",
            "Score meeting five higher than this. Although it is.",
            "Yes. Higher than this. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes I agree. I had also very similar impression of the meeting. So redundancy. And some factual mistakes. And not understanding some. So it. From some pieces it is clear that the person didn't get the main idea.",
            "Superficially, this looks also very good. Like I haven't read those five and eight in detail. But superficially I would put them on in the same rate.",
            "Okay. But let's so look at line forty one, if you look at my screen. NLP technologies. And then a big piece of the NLP technologies. This is not about NLP technologies. This was one of the deliverables. And there were they were discussi. So one of the deliverable was on the NLP technologies. And then there were s four more deliverables. And it's not.",
            "And actually, yes. So it's the problem that this is the report on workshop.",
            "On NLP technologies. So this. And. The the title was written like by someone who didn't understand it. The the a the annotator actually knew that it is a report on the NLP technologies in some way. But it's the report on the workshop. So I'll search for technologies. We don't have a review for the report on NLP technologies. So that is my. Not so familiar with NLP technologies and the workshop and NLP technologies. It's probably misunderstanding. Yeah. So well, the technologies re appear in the transcript only three times or so. And it never clarifies. Because we all in the meeting know it. That we are not like discussing NLP technologies. We are discussing the presentation of NLP technologies to lay people. So it's like a workshop that we prepared. Workshop on NLP technologies where we are presenting those. And we are writing a report on the preparations and the content of this workshop. But that is not said in the in the transcript. So it's understandable that t someone outside from the field does not realize it at all. So it's hard to blame the person for that lack of background knowledge. I would say at least like it should it should be report on NLP technologies. If if the annotator said make the title report on on NLP technologies, then I would be happier with that. But since it shows just NLP technologies, it is like inappropriate summarization.",
            "Yeah. And yes. And one more thing if we look at the distribution of the topics. Then financial, financial tables a lot of lines. Report and dissemination, a lot of nine lines. But quite quite a few about the demo. That was actually a lot. There was a big discussion of the demo. That which is deflected in the zero five for example. But it is unclear.",
            "Oh I see a lot of points in the demo.",
            "Maybe here. Yes. Maybe. So this is my just.",
            "So. One point is like some very generic discussions that were not -",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Yeah. Are there.",
            "Yeah. That is the main point about this meeting. Details are mentioned there.",
            "Sorry z what is the main point? Again speak slower, PERSON6.",
            "So it is about the -",
            "Okay so. The the things which were not having much relevance. They are actually bulleted here.",
            "Okay. Yeah, so it's too detailed.",
            "Yes. But. Too detailed on the points that me and PERSON6 considered not the most important of the meeting.",
            "It doesn't mean that they are not. But we really agree on this point.",
            "It seemed us. Probably you are not. Although you have been. Probably we are not right. So it's really interesting thing. But. So I said that we agree in this point and yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So did you did you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, now we hear you. Yeah yeah yeah. We did hear you.",
            "Okay, so, yeah. I was saying w I think PERSON9 repeated that. So I was saying that some things which are not having much relevance are actually listed here. In this meeting. So that is I think the biggest drawback about this meeting. Like everything is mentioned. Whatever was said. Everything is mentioned here. It is more kind of jotting down points rather than minuting.",
            "Yeah. At the same time I think that this is the ideal where we can like technically where we could get. So I think that. The systems if we manage to put them together. They will provide either something similar to nine. Which would be bad. Or something which would be similar to eight. Which would be already a success.",
            "So.",
            "I don't expect that we could get any further.",
            "Nine is something like key word extraction technique.",
            "Yes. Yeah.",
            "So it is extracting key words in -",
            "And pr. Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Well. Unfortunately. Did this was really interesting me. And I'm I'm very happy that you did this. I hope that you learned a lot. At least it makes the impressiont that you learned a lot about that. So that's that's great. So I would really like to ask PERSON11 to run this transcript through anything of the shelf. And and give us the the key words. The the short bulleted lines. That will be very useful to the state of the art is is close enough to number nine. I actually don't expect that. But I'm I'm curious. Maybe it is. Maybe. Yeah. And otherwise it's great that you have some opinion on the ranking. But still. We w this is a very good starting point for the evaluation. So that now we can discuss it -",
            "I don't mean it to be final. I was just thinking about how I evaluate that. I'm not creating the final table. Just.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Formalizing what I think.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think that's.",
            "You did a very good job in altogether, all of you.",
            "We learned a lot actually from this from this exercise.",
            "So. Well. I'll I really have to leave. But the next steps. What are next steps? The the formal thing. Applying for the task. Working on the data. And for the evaluation. What are the next steps? Like how to how to proceed with the design of the manual evaluation method?",
            "So. I have noted down the discussion that we have for each of the minutes. I will share the doc with all of us. And then we read through that and then again retrospect what we discussed. And then we come up. And then we compare with the with the already that is already there. For the various manual evaluation metrics. And then freeze out some of them which we would like okay. These are recurring. And this is what we want to see. In an ideal minute. And then freeze those.",
            "Yeah. And we also need to educate. I don't really want to say train. But ideally train annotators to do this. So there there should be one phase. It ca it can come up later. It can come like in May. Or April May. But this is about the time where in the annotators need to stabilize and understand these criteria. So that they would be able to assign it in some like with some agreement. So we we should also measure agreement.",
            "PERSON3 we are working on that.",
            "Okay.",
            "But first step is the alignment.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So now they're being trained to align. And. By this step, they will be grown to esti to evaluate it in other.",
            "Yeah. That's good.",
            "Dimensions too. So it's.",
            "I agree.",
            "Really hopeful hopefully it will be but later.",
            "Yeah, okay. Great. So. I'm I'm leaving. And so who who can I make the main host now?",
            "Make me. Or PERSON9. Doesn't matter.",
            "Yeah. So I'm I'm making PERSON8.",
            "It's it's just important who has the recording.",
            "Yes.",
            "You have it anyways. So it doesn't matter.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. So thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you. Bye bye.",
            "Bye. Bye. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Goodbye.",
            "Just should we finish with the rest ones? Maybe we will look at the six.",
            "Yeah, maybe.",
            "What do you think about six?",
            "Minute six. Oh. This minute was not good.",
            "Not good. Aha. PERSON3 had. Had to listen to that.",
            "Aha. This minute is not good because there are some details which are not even there in the transcript.",
            "Yes. What do you think these details are? Do you have any.",
            "Okay. So let's see. I have noted some points.",
            "Huh.",
            "Open that. Minute six, right?",
            "What?",
            "Minutes six, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "We're talking about minutes six.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. Yeah. Okay. So for example,. Like it is good because the annotator has went beyond what is the reported in the transcript. Especially of the links. Like the ORGANIZATION2 link. Then the doodle poll link. So yes. So I would say this is something that the annotator did beyond the scope of the transcript. It's good. For from that point. But at the same point. Like if we like the things that are not mentioned in the transcript. And also evaluation system can't can never do. So this is only possible for humans to like again go back and pull out those details. And okay. And also. I felt that some unnecessary details. Like example for the section numbers. I don't feel that those should be part of the part of the minute. Because for someone who was not part of that, it would be really confusing if he is not aware of what is meant by D2.1 and those steps. So I would say that the annotator has done a good job. But from the point of view if we want to have systems that would learn from this minute. The system will be confused.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. And PERSON6?",
            "Yeah. So I totally agree with PERSON9. So he this is these links are good. But then. You know also. Can you notice that some some few things like after the ORGANIZATION7. If you just scroll down. There is ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION6 it is blank. So what does that mean? Like. Did they did not mention some point? About this? So why why are we even why the annotator was actually referring that they didn't mention they did not mention some point? So i. The two are blank. So it is seeming more like in automatic thing than the automatic system can maybe extract that. But human. It doesn't make sense. And yeah. Much information is captured if I see it from the perspective of coverage. Almost all of the things are there. But some irrelevant things are also included. Which might not be required. So like last week we mailed PERSON1 to let him now that we are still working to replicate services. So this this this is the the the actually this the sequence is not followed. Here. So. What replicated services are we talking about.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. I do. Yeah. Do you guess what for minutes are these? Who created it?",
            "Y. PERSON3?",
            "These are the original minutes of the meeting.",
            "Huh okay.",
            "Oh. So who created it?",
            "He so he crea. He PERSON3 created it.",
            "Oh I guessed right then.",
            "So.",
            "This is actually the real.",
            "Because you know. Huh.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You know why I I guessed that? Because he I think because he created the minutes because he can find the links easily. So.",
            "This was actually the real agenda. Pre-prepared before the meeting. That was full additional information during the meeting. So as we have our literal remote meetings. If you you could even find it in the ORGANIZATION3 Docs. This was one of the remote meetings. And now in November. That you have been taken part of. Are in this same ORGANIZATION3 document. So this is we write down before the meeting. And then kind of fulfill during the meeting. And this is mostly PERSON3 who fulfills it. Sometimes PERSON5. But. So this of course definitely it includes a lot of additional information. Including the links. Because you just give the people the link. But it's actually very very nice to know that the reaction to that. So it means we never create well. Just. It's not automatically processible such kind of minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's really not processi. So it really includes information that is not in the transcript. It is bad. Cannot be so.",
            "Yeah. If you don't have something on the transcript. Like for information it is impossible to have.",
            "Yes, definitely. It is not. Well. Okay. I think we are almost done. So we discussed the are. So PERSON9's minutes last time. I don't think we have to go to the. Reasonably. Evaluated. We didn't look at number four. I just separated it to the lines. Because I wanted to align it. So as for me the minutes number four are very good from the point of view of correctness. And so. Really now I'm speaking about four. So.",
            "From the point of view of content they are correct. So everything that is written there has been discussed. And this be. The correct relevance and topicality. So it's really it's can be seem that the person who re wro writes it understands what is going on.",
            "And and.",
            "But I think the same problem as my minute had. This minute has the same problem. That not much details are mentioned. Like there are some missing things. Like I did not like. It is highly abstracted. Like. So not much details are covered here as well.",
            "Yeah. What else is there. So.",
            "Yeah. That is one thing.",
            "So I would say it could be usable. That you read this text. These are not actually minutes. These are a kind of a kind of text. You read this text. And understand what was going on at the meeting. And go to the transcript and find this places in transcript.",
            "Though readability is very good in this minute.",
            "Yes.",
            "It is. You ca. With the flow. So you an easily read and understand. So whatever is returned, it is returned perfectly. And quite. Anyone can understand it. So understandability and readability I I would call 5 like full full. But then some some topics are missing actually.",
            "Yes. So yeah. Actua.",
            "Yeah. So. So. One. So one important thing that I felt as part of minuting. Is to have two things. That what has been done. And what is to be done.",
            "Yes.",
            "So. Picking out action points. Picking out action points along with the general discussion of what has been done earlier. In case of this technical meeting. So again. Meetings have different objectives. But for PROJECT1 the meetings are mostly okay. So during the past month the this has been done. And this we need to do for the coming days. These two questions are very important. That what has been done. And the general discussion of wh about that.",
            "And more most importantly. What are the action points that come from the meeting. That has to be performed. Specifically. So yeah. So w like like when I did minu. Did it manually. So my objective was to like whoever is not there should understand that what are the actions point next. And also for the and also for follow structure. So that it is easier for the annotators to align. So with this maybe two objectives I did the minuting. But I definitely missed two like group them into topic.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes. Yes. Well it's really.",
            "For minute four.",
            "So.",
            "So from minute four the action points are not really visible.",
            "Yeah. And even can you see one thing. That minute nine. Which was the most worst minute. It did the only thing that I felt good about it was that they have the the annotator has actually mentioned milestones. And summary. So this did two.",
            "Things are good about that meeting. Only that thing is good.",
            "Well.",
            "You know what to do.",
            "No dissemination happened. It's true actually.",
            "Yeah. So you know what to do next, right? So in in the summary's there. So this is quite good distinction.",
            "Well. Okay. So I think we have we have mentioned a lot of things. Probably we can stop here. And if PERSON9 you would be so kind.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To send us the what you have written down.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thank you very much. And I think we can stop for t.",
            "Maybe like I le.",
            "Yeah. I did a very bad minuting for today's meeting.",
            "So I.",
            "Like. Understandable format.",
            "I think I think you could very successfully complete it with program that would create the bullet points. But let's see.",
            "Okay. Okay. So I will take hour or so. I I I will prepare it finally and then share with.",
            "Thank you very much. Well I and I thank you very much for the evaluations and for the big work you have done. So we really went kind of deeper into the the contents. And from different sides. It was very interesting. That PERSON3 is a participant participant of the meeting. And understood the lines totally differently than I did.",
            "Yes.",
            "And there was also kind of difference between how me and PERSON6 understood versus what PERSON9 did and took out of it. It was also very informative for me.",
            "So for me I also got that I understood less. Really. I'm not so much in many topics. Maybe I'm not so good in English. I don't know. But anyway really maybe I'm slow in audio or I don't understanding the audio and understanding many people speaking within with each other. But y I really reading their summaries. I got I I understood that I was worse than most of annotators. So I me. So I wouldn't do it better.",
            "Which was your minute PERSON8?",
            "I didn't put it there.",
            "Oh oh oh. So we cannot see.",
            "So we cannot see that. Which was PERSON6's? Which was PERSON6's?",
            "Yeah, third one. My third one. We discussed, no? Third one. Yes. Mine was third one.",
            "And actually kind of mine was this seven one. But the idea was my idea was to create very bad minutes. Bu I actually.",
            "So the idea was to make something bad that we could convert to something good. But when I got this nine and I decided.",
            "So you did minutes seven?",
            "I did seven. But I didn't try to make it exhaustive. I really wanted to. But not really wanted, but.",
            "PERSON8? You did.",
            "Okay.",
            "Did you hear me?",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "It seemed like delay. Well I began to make seven. But then I got nine. And I decided to put nine instead of my seven.",
            "Okay. Okay. Wonderful. So. For tomorrow's for tomorrow's meeting we should. The idea is to analyze today's discussion with respect to the manual evaluation measures that are already there in the doc. And then try to come up with your views. And maybe tomorrow we need to freeze out that which should be there in the as a.",
            "Yes.",
            "But wh one more thing that w once we see that automatic thing, we can come up with more evaluation measures. Like.",
            "Yes.",
            "Not evaluation measures. But things which which can occur in in evaluating. Because anyhow we have to evaluate the shared task minutes, right? So.",
            "Well it's not real not definite definite. But PERSON11, are you there?",
            "Yes, I'm here.",
            "When could you prepare all these bullet points? Automatically created?",
            "I don't know. It may take a lot of time. Because they don't provide the code, so. There is a lot of reverse engineering effort to do that.",
            "Well. Okay. When just say us when it happens. So it really w.",
            "Okay. So.",
            "Definitely.",
            "Okay. So thank you. So let us meet tomorrow. Same time.",
            "Yes.",
            "Please take care.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "And you too.",

            "Where do they would understand our book? I don't know. Like if we think the book will be good maybe should get good reviewers cause they will give us good feedback. If we will think the book won, won't be good anyway so -",
            "So we can - Maybe we can ask if we have the book ready we can ask someone to review the book and send him the book and ask, ask him to do you think this book is OK -",
            "And if you think would you, would you be the reviewer?",
            "Like we is so first if you think it's OK - Only if you think through that you should be reviewer. I think it's not independent.",
            "Yeah, that's right. That is -",
            "I know -",
            "Like what, what you mean by - Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I know tuns of people so I can ask a lot of people but - I just need to know like some rules like more, more details. So where you at should be at least a doctor, whether it should be someone with knowling to LOCATION2 or I don't know.",
            "OK. So I, I will ask, I will ask PERSON2 what, what -",
            "Where the...",
            "Yeah. I don't know what's in our situations anyway so -",
            "OK, so it should be less, less strict then for, for,, for the reviewers of disertation so but you can have check reviewers of disertation.",
            "Like -",
            "Non ORGANIZATION7, from outside -",
            "Maybe not in, maybe only outside... The our faculty.",
            "So I don't know.",
            "OK, so - I guess, yeah.",
            "Yeah, I can -",
            "You should try to ask PERSON2 again and...",
            "I can, I can ask PERSON4, he's, he's my friend for years.",
            "He's best Bohemian.",
            "He'll definitelly say, OK, this book is great. And he is, he is associate professor so -",
            "Yeah, we could ask,, what's his name,... PERSON3.",
            "PERSON3?",
            "OK, so,, what we have in the agenda? Nothing else. So let's go to - What is new in the book.",
            "Yeah. If anyone push anything in the morning?",
            "Yes, I did.",
            "OK, so I shell pull and make again. Did you fix the missing figure?",
            "Yes, I did.",
            "Great.",
            "I think I have the version from which is one hour like old so it,, should be updated.",
            "OK.",
            "I can share the screen. Where is it?",
            "I fixed it immediately after you, you wrote it, or probably not. Anyway I, I fix it immediately after I turn on the, the computer in the morning.",
            "OK.",
            "OK.",
            "Which was like 7: 30 or something like that.",
            "OK, so I, probably I have the current version. OK.",
            "Today, today I, today I went through the all book,, I, I haven't read it all but just skim, skimed it like parts and I, I read the pre, preface which is very, very good. Does PERSON18, PERSON18.",
            "Yes.",
            "You, you wrote it's PERSON18.",
            "Yes, I did.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I think this is, this is great. I, I skimm the, the first section. OK. So then we have the notable models. So that, that, that is, that was written by PERSON18 and PERSON5 or, or only by PERSON18?",
            "From PERSON5's text but other words is through the know by me, I guess.",
            "So it's Word, Word2vec,, RNN's, transformer. Transformer is very short.",
            "Yes, because everything is explained.",
            "Everything is ready in,, yeah.",
            "The, the only thing I say, you take the transformer encoder and transformer decoder which I described in section 1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "1.3.2 and, and that's it.",
            "Yeah. Kove, PROJECT2 and PROJECT1 I suppose. Great. And GPT is missing so that's what,, I suppose GPT should be there, here as well.",
            "So do you think? Or it shou, it can be -",
            "That, you don't have the latest version by the way there're like four more paragraphs about PROJECT1.",
            "Sorry?",
            "That you don't have the latest version but it doesn't matter.",
            "You - I don't have the latest version? Aha.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, the image is still missing so you don't have the latest version.",
            "Aha. OK. Yeah, so probably my morning was earlier than PERSON18's morning.",
            "Yeah, so you wrote already something about GPT?",
            "No. But I almost finished writing about PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "And the or -",
            "So should I - OK. Yeah, I read this interpretation and I, I think that,, there should be something like introductory, introductory paragraph to this. Because when I, when I, when I read it I, it post like,, bigger step for me. Maybe it should be - So this, this was written by PERSON10, yeah?",
            "Yes. Written, well.",
            "Maybe some introductory,, OK that neural networks are like black boxes we don't know. There are, there are plenty of parametres and we don't know nothing about it and we would like to know what, how about their behaviour and,,, or is, it is here? Yeah, it is, it is in the to do,, so black boxes, we need to interpret them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because there is - Yeah, there are, there are so far there are many to does, so there is not, not much text. So I don't know how, how much text you are planning to write there.",
            "Well, I don't know either. I'm like - I think it would be at least 3 pages. Maybe more if I have time to read,, the paper are in to do section.",
            "Yeah. Maybe I, I, I, I would restructure it in the way that first I would write, OK, so these so all, all the methods, al, all the, all the architectures we described in the previous chapter are very complex and,, vital like black box and we need to interpret them and then you can - You can ask, what is, what is really interpretability may. But, but anyway you - Yeah, these tell like to,, transparency or post hoc interpretation and you will use the - We will, we will, in this book we will use the post hoc, post hoc interpretability so -",
            "OK, I will do that.",
            "Yeah. Or if, if anyone of you have another,, idea to do it?",
            "No, no, no. This is fine.",
            "Yeah and then - Yeah and what is, what is probing,... So maybe we should, we should,, write here about,, what are the,, the methods we will use for, for interpret,, interpretations because,, OK, the probing originally it was for all the post hoc interpr, interpretation methods. It was like, it was the synonymum of the post hoc interpretation. But then,, this is mainly meant as, it's mainly meant as,, classif, as a classifiers. So maybe we should somehow distinguish the methods we will, we will use in our book. So what about for example I don't know sup, supervised and unsupervised? Or how to would - If it is not probing what is it?",
            "Well, would you,, for in senses hear it and PERSON6 paper when they do the projection,, up the stace su, such that there's which are close an independency tree should be closed in a vector space. Do you call this probing or no?",
            "I, I would, I would call it probing because they, they're like training the, the metrices. So they are training the parametres. Is it all, this is only linear projection but it is something... I don't know.",
            "Yeah, but it's not - It, it's still a classifier.",
            "It's not a classifier but yeah.",
            "They call it probing, yeah.",
            "They, yeah, they call it probing but yeah, you are right that is not classifier but there is, something is trained there. So, yeah, it's not classifier because it's, it's training for, for, yeah, for the best distances that are, that, that match the, the dependency trees. So, yeah, this is something in the middle, yeah. But, but OK. If, if he, if he would,, if he divides the metod to supervised and unsupervised so this probing would be supervised because it is a training on some,, gold data.",
            "Yes,.",
            "The PTA and,, what PERSON10 is doing on word embeddings or,, like the attentions,, gettig, getting the dependancy tree from attention metrices or this is rather unsupervised or because we are not training anything.",
            "Yeah, I would probably say that we understood probing as supervised.",
            "What about the thing that you upgold birth it and, and the best paper from the last year nackled it. They,,, just mask some words in sentences and looked, looked, if, if bird is capable of, of filling the gaps in tactical correctly and the paper from nakl was similar for multimodel translation there were masking words and, and wor, and observing if the model can recover the missing words from,, from the image. Is that probing?",
            "No.",
            "I wouldn't say it probing.",
            "Alright.",
            "Both, both of the papers call it probing by the way.",
            "Aha. OK. So, so do you think it, it should be,, like the, the different methods like, like general method should be here in this chapter or?",
            "Probably, yes.",
            "Because, because later, like the attentions are, it is like,, mainly not probing where else the, there's PERSON5's section is mainly probing so,, it can be described in that chapters as well. And PERSON10 in, in like the how it is called. Neural language model embedding, so embeddings... Here in the methods are - There is not much probing here I suppose.",
            "Well, not yet but there should be.",
            "OK. So, so maybe, yeah. Maybe the, like the methods in general should be described, described here after the,, after the, like the introduction to interpretation.",
            "Yeah, I think it, it should be descripted here in the section, yeah.",
            "Yeah. Because - Yeah. What, what is -",
            "What follows is the hidden states grape on insto input words, which is, which is - So this is, this is copied from, from your,, this is still text copied from your, -",
            "Probably...",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is from PERSON5's chapter.",
            "This is from PERSON5.",
            "It's - First into the -",
            "Yeah, this is, this is, yeah.",
            "Models and then I, then I moved it here.",
            "Yeah, this is the text that - Yeah, that is very, or not very similar but it's, it's described as same as -",
            "I described in my part and so it should be probably here because it is common for all the, all the fa, at least for our two, our two attention and contextual -",
            "And representate parts.",
            "Yeah, yeah. For word embeddings it doesn't have this problem. There is only the problem if you have subwords. I don't know if we talk about that somewhere.",
            "Like that - Yeah, we'll talk - We need very to representations but we usually have subword representations.",
            "Yeah. I don't know. Me, yeah. I, I will go through my text -",
            "Maybe it is there so I -",
            "I can copy part of it to here and then we, we'll somehow to mentioned.",
            "Yeah, so we - So I don't know. Do we agree on, on what probing is? Or we should probably not like define it, we should rather probably discuss that there is like in general idea of probing in the sense of just looking for something and then some people understand it in a more specific way of training -",
            "And classifire.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think we shouldn't like define it here we should rather review how people use it truly and what they can mean by that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that, that we still use the word -",
            "If we, if we will use it in our text then -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We should, we could at least define not like, not maybe definition but we should say what we mean by the def, by the probing and...",
            "Do we have - What, what do we call it if it's not probing? Is analysis?",
            "Not probing.",
            "And there is lot of stuff which is not probing. Like going shopping.",
            "Also some of the probing is not probing. So we can interpret a neural networks by going shopping.",
            "Yeah. We could talk about unsupervise probing when it's not trained. I don't know if anybody uses such a term.",
            "Yeah. I don't know will unsupervised analysis or - Yeah, it is analysis. Probing is analysis as well.",
            "Cause - Yeah.",
            "Like unsupervised probing.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So...",
            "Yeah. So some people call it probing when it is -",
            "Featchures analysis.",
            "Sorry?",
            "Featchures analysis.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, but, yeah, but the, but important is that is, is unsupervised.",
            "Because if you, if you probing for parter speech text it's also featchures analysis maybe.",
            "Yeah. And you can probe for parter speech text like by really training the classifier.",
            "Or you can just do some clustering or you can do key nearest neibourghs. I think that somewhere that they do key nearest neibourghs, well, maybe one nearest neibourgh even, so it's not trained but it's a classification.",
            "OK. I have some notes here but I cannot read them.",
            "OK, it's secret.",
            "Yeah, this - We already discussed that. OK.",
            "OK, so who is, who will write this,, like that, this distinctions? Or this definitions? Or this, this,,, types of methods?",
            "Well, I can start with something and then you could all read it and then we can disagree and see where it goes.",
            "Yeah. If, if you, PERSON10 if you - Yeah, you have many, many no, like interesting papers here so, so you plan to include them?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK. And when?",
            "As soon as possible.",
            "So, OK. So yeah, also - Or maybe I can, I can write a bit about, about the, about the -",
            "OK.",
            "About the recurrent methods and y, you can write about, you can, about,, like the,, from these interesting papers if there is any interesting things to add.",
            "At least the first two I think should be added there. The rest it's not so important.",
            "OK, so if we - OK. So and then these, it should be also here the hidden states coresspond and input words because it's common to, to out to that the following sections. So,, so I will, I will, I will move there some text of mine and,, you'll, you will match it somehow. Yeah. And I, anyway I will need to rewrite my,, my introductory sections about it because there is, there is a lot of common and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "I think like,, yeah, I'm not sure actually. I understood that like first we should have all the content somewhere and then we can merge it and move it and -",
            "Yeah, of course.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Of course.",
            "So -",
            "Yeah, first - Yeah, if you don't have all, all your content -",
            "Of first writed content.",
            "So that we have, yeah, only information at least somewhere.",
            "Yeah.",
            "At least on time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And yeah, and see. So because we have the deadline for,, for all the content -",
            "End of June?",
            "The next, it's next week, yeah?",
            "Yeah. Next Tuesday. So next Tuesday all the content should be there.",
            "OK.",
            "So stories from the neural networks. So PERSON10, what do you,, what are your plans with your,, with your chapter?",
            "Sorry, what? What are my plans or?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well, my plan is to write and write and then it will be written. I don't know, right now -",
            "This is starting, this is starting like language model before neural networks and neural language models and I don't know where it this should - Maybe this should go to the notable models. Doesn't it?",
            "Well, maybe. Yeah, that I'm... I, I think that I will like merge this with notable models in the end.",
            "Because if we had a section about mod, notable models I, I would, I would start, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Vector -",
            "I think that -",
            "Things and these are rather like description of the, of the models. Like 4, 4.1 and 4.2.",
            "Yeah and some, some of what is,, in 4.1 and 4.2 already is in the notable models so I will have to delete it and, yeah, just say that you should look in to the previous section.",
            "You don't need to delete it, you ju,, maybe there is more information here so just -",
            "Yeah,, merge it. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I, I avoided speaking about any interpretation, I just technically decribed how the models look like and how they are used in NLP tasks.",
            "So I, I think -",
            "So all -",
            "Starting by thre, 4.3,, like the...",
            "4.3.",
            "We side like the skip gram and the, and the aritmetic,, vector aritmetic and the, so this, this, this, this can be, this is an interpretation of, of -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So it may, it may start by this,, like the word analogies on, on word embeddings.",
            "I would say. That, that's my opinion.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you have another, please say it. OK, so this is, these, these are word analogies. Then,... So Glove... I'm sorry I, I haven't read this part today so I don't know what is put in.",
            "Well, this is,, unfinished text about Glove.",
            "But it, it is that Glove is - So it's only des, description of Glove or it is,...",
            "No, als. It's mostly interpretation.",
            "OK. OK. So then the visualisation. Which is and TS, TSN, nice - OK, then component analysis and... So you plan to include, include your, your results of component an, of PCA?",
            "Yes, PCA definitelly. Maybe ICA, I don't know.",
            "So it, it's still lot of, lof of text here is missing.",
            "Yes. Also lot of images are missing.",
            "So, so basely please add it there. At least, at least copy, copy the text from the papers so that we know how much and what we have there. So that we, we have all the, all the content there,... OK. So these are the,, unsupervised PROJECT4. So that's...",
            "What is it? Or I, I know what is it but what, what's that in the, in the paragraph?",
            "Well, this is just a basic description and I'm actually not sure if this is going to stay there because I don't really know if there are really interesting papers like interpreting unsupervised PROJECT4.",
            "OK, so this is probably be, be deleted.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And sentiment it's, yeah, it's from your, from your papers. And,, the GPT?",
            "Yeah, again I'm not sure. Maybe I will just you know delete this section because I think that there are more, it's more interesting to look into attentions in the transformer architecture in general than to interpret word embeddings which even aren't there. I would just you know the simplifying, I would just concentrate on word embeddings in this chapter and leave this generative models.",
            "OK. OK, so please in the next week do the....",
            "Yeah.",
            "All the deletions and all the deletions and,, move the -",
            "Deletions mostly.",
            "And add it then and mostly additions. Yeah and all the, all the figures,, add. Add them there. No matter format. So, so that all, they, so that we know what it, what is it going to be there. And so we can see what, what - Yeah, we can see the contents,.",
            "By the way is, is anyone going to talk specifically about the GPT models? Because if not then there is a question if, if they should be -",
            "Yeah.",
            "In, in the notable models.",
            "I mention,, some GPT stuff but I don, I don't yet know if there will be anything like, yeah, some of the contextual embeddings, probings, also probe GPT.",
            "And say something about it. I just don't yet know whether GPT is special in some way so that we need to go in to detail on it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I very probably will mention some results that are on GPT.",
            "Yeah, I, I will also, I have also have one, one paper Monday analyse the,, analyse the attention,, attentions, attention way of GPT's and they - Yeah, so I will mention it as well so - But -",
            "Alright.",
            "Yeah, so I would let it there so far and we, we will see but yeah.",
            "Oh, leaving it there means writing it.",
            "Because it is not, that is written.",
            "No.",
            "Aha. So maybe...",
            "That I, I, I can write two or three paragraphs just, just briefly say that, that is a language model that, that it's a transfor, transformer without an encoder.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I think, yeah. That's, that's probably reasonably, like nothing too detailed, -",
            "Yeah, not to spend to much time on it -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's like -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Two paragraphs about GPT and then we will see whether how much we -",
            "Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.",
            "OK. And then there is the, in debiassing. So PERSON10 you, do you plan to write about this debiassing thing?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so far you, it is like one paragraph, like four, four lines.",
            "Yeah, right now it's just one paragraph. It will be longer. There is a figure somewhere.",
            "Yeah, the figure is - Yeah, here is a figure.",
            "Yeah. So I want to write enough to like explain this figure at least.",
            "OK. Dog is barking.",
            "Who's dog is it?",
            "Also,, at the end of the chapter I would like to show you some images which I was planning to use but now I'm not really sure if - If I can, if I can. So there is a link in the discussion on the left.",
            "Where? Discussion on the left?",
            "What discussion?",
            "Events. I don't know. It's on the left.",
            "Under the PROJECT3 ORGANIZATION2. You can click the message thing and there's a link.",
            "Or I can share my screen.",
            "OK. So let's share your screen.",
            "It's a green rectangle. On a white background.",
            "Wait the minute. Wait a minute. OK. Now. Now do you see yourself on my screen?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes. OK. Well -",
            "I'm at least three times there.",
            "Here on the left you can click events and you get the link here.",
            "But I can also just click the link and show you. Right.",
            "OK.",
            "But there's, there's this image. That's from Glove web and there are these bands. These are embeddings. Like every column is an embedding and, and the most frequent words are on the right. And it shows these bands and they claim that other embeddings have similar structure. So I tried that and I did Word2vec on the ORGANIZATION3 and I took FastTex the, that was trained on Czech ORGANIZATION6 -",
            "And Word2vec looks like this.",
            "So there is nothing?",
            "There is no bands it's just noise. FastTex looks like this. There is a -",
            "There is one band.",
            "One band, maybe more bands. But then -",
            "There's much, much less noise than in the original image. And now I'm trying to train Glove on the ORGANIZATION3 and it was running overnight and then it failed.",
            "So now I'm reconfigured it and I'm trying again. So, yeah, I don't know what to make of it.",
            "Like -",
            "Well... We could just include the, the images and show that the embeddings different but I don't know if we know why or? Like - I, I would, would for including it but yeah, I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Tdddd. Ttttm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The Glove website says that the horizont to band result from the fact that mul, multiplicatly interactions in the model occure component wise.",
            "And -",
            "Have you idea what that means?",
            "Yeah.",
            "They say that -",
            "We write the book for PERSON17.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They say that this featchure is not unique to Glove. In fact I'm annowere of any model for word vectors learning that avoids this issue.",
            "So we'll see once Glove finishes for you if, if you get it at least for Glove.",
            "Yeah. Then right the - I'm, I'm not sure why are they calling it an issue but anyway they're saying that all the models should have this property and I'm not really seeing it in Word2vec and the FastTex this strange.",
            "And it's trained on English. That to, the two plots you showed it's English, isn, isn't it?",
            "No. Like OK.",
            "It's Czech.",
            "That's other scheme. OK, the, the original plot is on English, this is on Czech.",
            "Alright.",
            "So, but like that shouldn't really matter, should it?",
            "I don't know.",
            "So we should try it on English as well, I guess. If it's not much work.",
            "Yeah, I'd like to do that and that's, that's, the other question is what data should I use for English.",
            "ORGANIZATION6?",
            "Well, yeah, that was boring, but OK. I don't know anything better actually.",
            "We have one, one ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Yeah, what reason that we don't see the bands in czech could be that similar,, that forms of the same lema got similar embeddings but the forms are of different frequences.",
            "Well, but still if you look at the original image - Which one is it? Here. You can see that some of the bands spent almost the whole vocabulary.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I'm only because I'm lazy and computers are lazy as well I'm only doing it for the 10000 most frequent words, so the bands should be even more pronounced here then in this in, in -",
            "In this -",
            "This image. So I'm only creating like the right most part of this.",
            "So the band should be clearly visible.",
            "Yeah. You can try down, downloading some, some already trained embeddings for English and, and have a look how it looks like. It should be easy.",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "Just now you can download FasText embeddings trained for any language.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that - These are actually this strange image is from FastText embeddings that I downloaded,, and that were trained on ORGANIZATION6 -",
            "And this is for Czech.",
            "So you didn't train this?",
            "No, I didn't train this one. I trained to Word2vec and now I'm training hopefully, I'm training Glove although - It looks the same before. It takes lot of time and then it suddenly says, I don't know, zero lines processed and - Well, we will see. Also I got an email that I'm approaching,, the quota on, on - What is this? Elnet splash MS.",
            "Yeah, so you can move it else where.",
            "Well, bu, I'm also approaching my quota on Elnet splash spack.",
            "So I'm like need to go through my files, find something that's not usefull anymore and delete it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know -",
            "You can move that to Elnet dep. I think the depo is maybe without quota.",
            "Yeah. I don't know how -",
            "Things for experiments right now but you don't want to delete it yet.",
            "I don't know how but I somehow manage to collect like half of terrabyte of data and...",
            "Alright.",
            "Oh, yeah, you should clean it up then.",
            "On Elnet list spack and I have a lot of, yeah. So that's what I'm doing right now.",
            "OK. So... Yeah. Yeah, for my, for my chapter - Yeah. I will need to rewrite, rewrite the introductions and yeah. Yeah, I, I still, I will lot of, lot of,, contents to write so... So let's, let's keep it maybe, maybe PERSON5,, can talk.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "The last what, what he has -",
            "Well, I will share my screen.",
            "I will not, yeah.",
            "Share my screen, share my screen. Yeah, and..",
            "Yeah, you have it there, yeah. Yeah. So I,, didn't really change the, the beggining of it. Yeah, I'm rearranging,, the stop,, here a bit. Basically I'm now working on integrating stuff from other papers. What I work on now is, yeah, OK, I added some things here. Yeah, I, I don't know how to structure thing like, yeah, grammatical error correction. So,, yeah, like they, they did probing for the task of grammatical error correction but I structured it by, not by the probing task but by the abstractions that you looked for. So I'm not 100% sure like OK what structures do you look for when you look for grammatical error correction. So at the moment I have it under semantics. It's probably rather a syntax but,...",
            "Did do they show any examples of the errors?",
            "Yeah, they do 17 tasks in this paper so I think they don't say much about the task but probably I will have to see what they do, like what they refer to -",
            "OK.",
            "To understand what it is. Anyway, yeah, what I worked on now is,, this thing? Yeah. Yeah, this, this section. So how is the,, information distrubuted across layers of RNN and transformers. And so this is kind of,, how it say, model section how I would like to have it so, so to say how the things work and then just add the citations to the, the papers that say it.",
            "How, how many layers did be great in the RNN only?",
            "2.",
            "Only 2.",
            "Usually 2.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some probings they have more. So Kove and PROJECT2 are defined as having 2 layers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then usually when they compare it to PROJECT1 and some probing papers then they try it let's take 4 layer ELM, PROJECT2, 8 layer PROJECT2 and let's see what happens.",
            "Yeah. So, so for this maybe, maybe of the first layer captures all these linguistic abstractions and the second layer is for like just task specific one.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Like you,, I think I was some second layer so where you know from, from many -",
            "Layers are there because -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That - Yeah, I know fr, that from PROJECT1.",
            "Like first, first half of the layers are like -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The second is RNN.",
            "Yeah, these are RNN but yeah, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It doesn't matter.",
            "Yeah. So yeah, I should explain that more I guess.",
            "Yeah, it seems that there aren't many -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "There aren't many layers.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Usually not. Yeah. Yeah and then for, for transformers I even tried to like,, make to bullet list of, of the findings of how information is distributed in transformers. I know obviously like all the findings come from I don't know like there are 5 different papers that basically say the same thing so I just tried to choose one for each claim. I, I'm aware you just to repeat all the papers that say it or -",
            "Oh, yeah. So this is all, this, all this things are like PERSON14 do just embeddings. Aha.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Only you. I know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So like initialization morfological abstractions there are like 10 papers that find that -",
            "Yeah. PERSON5 That, that morfology -",
            "It's maybe - Yeah.",

            "This, this maybe somehow aligned to the, to the,, like attention, attention.",
            "Cause there are also like the initial layers are like,, looking at the next.",
            "And this is like the morfological things.",
            "Then the, the,, the -",
            "In the, in the half of the, of the layer,, like the, in, layer in the middle -",
            "There are mainly capturing syntactic thins and -",
            "Then there are some coreferential links as -",
            "Like, like coreferen,,, the layers of the attention heads which capturing the coreferent.",
            "PERSON9 Coreferences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it maybe somehow.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's open.",
            "Yeah. So,, yeah, what's somebody said is that,, yeah, they, they talk about like the locality of, of the representation so basically that yeah. In the, in the first layers you guess things they are more lokal like morfology, then constituency syntax and then you get like long ran, more long range stuff like dependency syntax and then you can get through some semantics, coreference where you kind of need the whole sentence. So I guess that similar to the attentions. That,, like theoretically even in the first layer you can look anywhere in the sentence but in practice it seems that it's more like convolution like so that the deeper layers have a wider spen. So, so this is probably something you already say in the attention,, attention chapter.",
            "PERSON5 And I can just maybe refer to that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we know that, yeah. It gets less and less local so, so,, it's, it's kind of related to that. That's nice.",
            "About this distribution information that I like thing -",
            "Visualizations,, for actually most different transformers.",

            "PERSON8 For syntactic information.",
            "It say.",
            "But that's nice. That's nice. So yeah. It would be very nice to include. Yeah, I think it's exactly this picture here.",
            "So this is, this is, this is your figure?",
            "Yeah, it's my figure.",
            "That's very nice. So the, the darker it's more -",
            "Yeah, the darker is better.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So this is like it's always normalize.",
            "Says like the best car is -",

            "Yeah. It's like old style way of sharing screen.",

            "OK.",
            "Yeah, I think - Yeah, yeah, so this, this is really - Yeah, this should be show in abstraction across layers so I think it fit here nicely.",
            "OK, OK.",
            "Yeah and, and fortunately that's really the section that I, I was working on now so it's, it's in a good shape already rather -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I tried to -",
            "Maybe, maybe I could, I could do as,, similar, I could do the similar figure for this, like different types of,, of attention heads across layers as well.",
            "So like distribution. Not the abstraction, but distribution of like, yeah...",
            "Like different patterns -",
            "Of, of,, attention heads.",
            "And it would be, it would be similar because at the end, -",
            "The first layers are looking at the, an adjustement,, position and at the end there are looking at like, like -",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah. I tried to do something like in the sense like the, the teny paper they have,, some kind of nice but weird figures,, where they tried to show which is, what, what's where, so, so their probing does some attentions over the layers. So when they probe for morfology so in, into which layers it looks. So when they probe for name entities into which layers it looks. So I definitely cannot recreate the,, image. I could kind of copy paste it from the paper, I don't know. So but, but I tried to interpret in, in this table so,, they take the 20 birds and this is kind of an estimate from their groves like on which layers do these abstractions and merge and then,... Yeah, the last column is rewrite just interpreting the, the image so it's the desolution rather peaks or is it kind of flat that is everywhere across -",
            "PERSON5 Model layers so... It's kind of stupid without the image I guess. But it will be better if we have the image for,, for, at least for syntax I guess.",
            "But they said, yeah, it will be ugly, which it probably will I guess.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I - Well, I don't know if we can some whole extract it in a, in a good quality from the pdf. I, I don't -",
            "I can just like copy, copy it with, with the pdf viewer tools,...",
            "No, you, you can,, you can simply,, open it or import it into Inkscape.",
            "Aha, OK.",
            "And then degroup -",
            "Ungroup. Ungroup it.",
            "And use on that image. So it is possible.",
            "Yeah, you can, you can open it in Inkscape and,, if you, if you willish to extract the paper from,, do the image from the paper, you can save it,, as a, as a pdf with text,, in, in a latech format. Which means that all, all the text labels,, will be saved in a separate, separate tix file and, and you will include the tix file and what will happend is, is that, that you have a pdf without the text. And, and the text will be rendered during compilation so it will be the same font as, as we have in the book.",
            "Yeah. If,, the image, the original image in the paper is, is not relikely on image but, but the produced somehow within latex.",
            "Oh, or even if you export, I don't know, a pdf from Matplotlib or, or, or, or G.",
            "The image in the paper so I don't know whether the numbers and text are text and numbers or just an image. I didn't try so I have to see what happend when I open it in Inkscape. OK. I can try and we can, we can always delete it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I just - Yeah, doesn't know what, what, what's a good.",
            "There, there are if, if you can select,, the, the, if you can select the text in, at pdf with your, with your mouse then you can export it.",
            "OK, I'll see. I take just a note. OK.",
            "OK. So,...",
            "Anything else?",
            "I think, yeah, that's, that's kind of what I did. Yeah,, yeah. So yeah, so, so yeah. What I tried to do here, yeah. So we want to know in which layers what is and in the paper they have like three different ways of, of saying this and always it gets different results because it's hard to really say it so I just tried to interpret it somehow but -",
            "That's probably what we kind of want so we want to interpret the findings of other people, I don't know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, yeah, I didn't do much more, yeah.",
            "OK, so -",
            "Can - Can you rename the very last section of your chapter so that is not conclusion so we don't have like several conclusions after each other?",
            "I don't know. I removed some of the other conclusion so I think we now have just two. Now we have to put in a summary so we don't actually have two conclusions anymore.",
            "Oh. Alright.",
            "That was also this conclusion of your chapter?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, yeah. So I, I actually - Yeah, this, this is what I tried to do so -",
            "Alright.",
            "If you now look at the - Where is the contents? Yeah. So my section and there is the conclusion and there is the summary. So it is -",
            "Alright.",
            "Kind of good to me I guess but...",
            "Yeah, I think it's good.",
            "Well, it's then a question is if,, if you have a conclusion if, if all the other chapters sure have a conclusion as well.",
            "Well, I don't know. I don't know if I will -",
            "I, I can have a conclu.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can -",
            "But PERSON10 deffinitely have a summary at the end of his chapter.",
            "OK. I have nothing but I can, yeah, I can have a conclusion.",
            "Well, I -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know what I do have there.",
            "I, I also conclude something.",
            "Yeah. Like I think it's not a bad idea to, to just summ up like the main findings.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "OK. OK, great. So I, I suggest,, I will,, maybe I will create a table. Who is, who is going - What is, what is missing so the - What is missing in the, in the book and who is going to write it.",
            "Yeah, like for me it's really thi, this to do sections so -",
            "These, these are through the - Maybe you, you can, you can add to the table -",
            "PERSON9, everything we will, we would -",
            "Have or should -",
            "You don't have. And,, if you are,, if you are write, if you, where you write it you will just that it, it's finished. PERSON5 Yeah. So, so -",
            "So that we know -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That it progress because we have last week -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "To, to write it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so my to do. Yeah. Yeah, I want include all the papers in my to do section but like I have to look into them and see if they add something which I still don't have there and is imporant and if so then I will add them. And then like, like this, this merging of the information so that I, so that is not like just a review of the papers but it's extract information -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and present it nicely so...",
            "Yeah, but first -",

            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Be on. So I, I will, I will go through, through the book on, once more and I will, I will wri, write that,... I, I will create the table,, of missing things and who should do it and yeah. So that we, we know. OK. So anything else?",
            "So -",
            "Yeah. Try to, try to think about the reviewers.",
            "I will, I will ask PERSON2 and OK. So see you next week.",
            "Yeah. Meeting is the at what time, I don't know.",

            "What?",
            "OK. Yeah, so 11?",
            "And what about the meetings in July? There is this on, on 13th of July then we have -",
            "Yeah, 13th of July because the week before I'm not here and it's, it's the ORGANIZATION5 conference as well I think.",

            "Good for you.",
            "So we will - Yeah. So we will, we will see the next week what have and we can, yeah.",
            "Alright.",
            "Because it, it's, it's Tuesday and then, yeah, then it's Monday, the 13th it's Monday. So it, it's in -",
            "Yep.",
            "It is in the 13 days. Yeah, it, it's easy to - Compute it. OK. And the next meeting would be, I don't know whether. How you are here in, in July but,... I, I think we will, we hav, we will, we will see. OK. So, so but, OK. The next meeting is T,, the next week and then we will, we will see. OK?",

            "I have no idea.",
            "Okay, so we'll see., so anyway let's start. What's the progress for the PROJECT4, or is there any?",
            "Yes, like translation is still going, But it's only three or four parts, or, or maybe up to ten parts remaining. So, definitely tomorrow it will be like a whole bunch of a, or, Or like a whole Monolingual data will be translated tomorrow, so I can join it and start straining the systems. And, yeah. So I will train it on 8 GPU's in firewall just to like, hopefully, to have the results in five, Five to seven days. Still to have some time like one week ors, or more for, for other experiments, Or like whatever appears, or like comes up.",
            "Okay, I don't know what's the situation but I think, the cluster's quite. Free right now, so it should be -",
            "Yeah, yeah -",
            "Okay -",
            "I think so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, good,.",
            "I still have to wait for those like ten pieces to, to be finished just to have all the data.",
            "Okay so, okay so, so that's probably it for the PROJECT5 right? Or the PROJECT4.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Okay, so the next thing is PROJECT3. Do you have any update?",
            "No updates, or you have? Okay.",
            "Yeah., the number of users,, it improves to six users right now, we finished it.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I guess if we let wait long enough, then we will have the data we need.",
            "I think that was the, the email conversation with PERSON6. And that he was trying to push the people from ORGANIZATION3 but I'm not sure whether it was -",
            "Well, the thing is that PERSON1 is leaving, so -",
            "Um-hum, yeah.",
            "I'm not really sure who is going to take over from their side.",
            "Um-hum. Okay, but that seems like something is at least happening, so, so great. So about the -",
            "Yeah, like the, like the email from, from, PERSON6, Was that he's also pissed of PERSON1 and like -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I had that impression from the email that, sorry guys I cannot help you, I cannot even help myself with PERSON1 so, like.",
            "Um-hum. Well, we'll see I guess like, If we don't have any other or any plan B that's there's nothing much we can do. But how man, how many, participants or, logs do we have collected, Like six? You were saying, or how many, how many people?",
            "Yeah, si, six people.",
            "And we would, we would, what's the, what's the minimum we would like to have to, To have some -",

            "I, I mean i, i.",

            "Like fifty users, or yeah, I don't know how many, But yeah like fifty users would be okay.",
            "Um-hum. Okay so yeah, so if that's - Is there anything else for PROJECT3? Probably not right?",
            "No.",
            "So that's, that's great, that was fast. Maybe last thing, what's, what's the progress with PROJECT2s, PERSON12?",

            "Yeah -",
            "English-Czech model, so I'm, I'm preparing the, the script for that, And I'm following the instructions from that paper you sent me PERSON11.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Hopefully, you will start bringing today. So and we'll have this, this result as soon as possible for us to make the experiments. With the constrained decoder.",
            "Um-hum. So yeah, one question y, you train the model from the tutorial, Or did you already train it with the chained data?",
            "No, first try I did the tutorial -",
            "Um-hum -",
            "Part, so.",
            "Okay.",
            "Now I have the, the results if you want to -, you, you like to check right? That -",
            "Yeah, okay -",
            "The results were the same, we can do that.",
            "Yeah, okay, you can, you can send me message on, on Slack, And yeah I can, I can look at it and that would be good -",
            "And after that you can, you can start training baseline, and, Yeah, I need to check which version of FrSeC, has the constrained - well, PERSON8 will sending emails so, we know which version was it but, I still haven't checked how, how are constrained coding works exactly in FrSeC so, there's that -",
            "Yeah, I check it superficially, but I think that it's simple. We, we just have to make sure to use it correctly, but -",
            "Okay.",
            "I think it's okay.",
            "Um-hum, so, yeah, so that seems that you, you are still quite busy. That's good, I don't, PERSON16 do you have any, any suggestion, what else can be done? Right now, probably.",
            "Uh-hum no, I haven't thought about it.",
            "Um-hum, okay what I, what I think it's good like you still need the baseline model to have something to, To try the constraints with right? And that will take s, some time and yeah. Okay I guess like I'm not sure whether there's any technical stuff, okay. Like since we went through this, we kept quite fast. So yeah, one question, do you know, do you know PERSON12 the up, up, Do you have an update for the ORGANIZATION1? Do you know like if, if it's open, probably not right?",
            "Perfect, I check it today and it's, it will start today actually -",

            "Oh, that's great, okay. That sound.",
            "But I'll, I will have to check exactly,, how they would do that, because u,, I'm not sure how they, how they would deal with the, with the situation. I'm really far away from the embassy. So, I will -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I will prepare it and as soon as I have an, an answer from them, I let you know.",
            "Um-hum, okay that's, that's, that's great. And another thing, well since PERSON7 is here, I'm not sure PERSON7 but when, When, when are you officially starting to work with us, or?",

I can, we can, we can, move it to, to some personal, call or meeting. Like, I think this is good for now. Yeah, or just, just to be sure, like there's no,, like issues with the PROJECT4, right PERSON16? Like you're not bec being stuck on anything right?",

So if you, if you have time, or if you want, you can check, check whether it can be used for, For your experiments, but I am not completely sure whether the data is PROJECT4, So it might not be, like sufficient, like for, for the task, But you know, just so you know that we are -",

            "Okay. Okay. I still,, what what what are presentation? Oh, I hear myself. It should the definition of the task. And now, we should just the details.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So, I'm going to something.",
            "Well,, I couldn't hear what what PERSON3 said. Sound quality was distorted. It was bad all the time. So, I, was that question on me really? I'm looking at top of document. And I agree with what what PERSON3 probably has written here. And I agree that one of the intermediate goals is to ident, one of the use goals is to identified what degree the manualy created part a meetings are abstractive or extractive. I'm highlighting what I'm saying in the ORGANIZATION2 document. And the similarity of multiple manual minutes for the same meeting is also something we should tell us how divert the output the people are. And then what we have some minutes created automatically. We'll already know whether we are like in the range, or whether we are again far away from from that. So,, yeah, you don't have the the data here. I think it's,, the best way is that either you in in call you two in calls of PERSON7 or and PERSON5 together or each of you separately. We'll try to come up with some proposed measures of either the extractivness, abstractivness as wild goals or the similarity measure for for meanings.",
            "And then test it, describe it and and discuss it and and see what other thing as well.",
            "I don't have any more precise like specifications for the task. These both paths are just stepping stones. They are preparation for the main task, which I explained to PERSON5 quite even for detail and I think to PERSON7 as as well. And that goal is too around a shared task in minuting, in automatic summarization, and prepare the data for it, but the exact definition of what the task should be what is the inputs outputs. This is something that we have to discuss and propose ourselves. There is no one else to to tell us more.",
            "Mm-hmm, So,",
            "Yeah. Sorry. The sound is very bad. I suggest that everybody who is not talking should switch off their microphone. So I'm switching off my microphone hopefully that reuse the echo.",
            "Okay. So,, we wanted to ask that in the shared document there is a generated minutes by annotators A and B. So,, so there are,, annotators are actually like, the the, who are these annotators unlittle B and A. Who are these annotators? There are like -.",
            "Yes. This is a question for me. The annotators are human beings. So, original each document we have automatic transcripts but then the human annotators wrote corrected this human tr these automatic transcripts. So the result is the rated human transcripts. And then afterwards different annotators made minutes for base of this main transcripts. So data we have now is generated trans generated minutes mail. I don't have automatic summarizations at the moment for these meetings. Maybe PERSON4 is more -.",
            "That's what I wanted to wanted to ask that. So we have a system for generating automatic minutes. Are we, I'm sorry once -. We have a system for generating automatic minutes. Great.",
            "Yes? And as of now we don't have anything. So what we have tried is using, well, of the shelve system of someone tasks actually. So, there is the like the maybe you know the web page talking to transformers. So there is its transformer model that is trained on very large data and that transformer model can do summarization if you feed it with preceding text and then as a last sentence you put in this TL semicolon DR and it will start summarizing by itself because in the many datas, data sets it has seem also so like longer longer e-mails and that had this too long don't treat interaction to a summary. So then some little summary starts appearing. Very abstractive one. Obviously non extractive. So one of our colleagues has has tried this. And then also there was PERSON2 for for PERSON3 and the other one was PERSON2 and he has train transformer to convert like machine translation model again. But now not strain on the large data but strain directly of the task of summarizing. So the input was, for example, full article from news and the expected output was the first paragraph which is often the summary of the article. Or it was the full paragraph and the title as the target. But we don't have any data that would be directly corresponding to the data that you are looking at. All the summarization training data that we have are from like available data sets, and these are mainly a news. So the domain is very different and therefore the results are very bad. So PERSON3 I think you you probably have some some of those horrible outputs, don't you have those as well?",
            "Yeah. I'm look for. But do you think this.",
            "Later later if you can please later show these horrible outputs to the PERSON7 and PERSON5. It would be helpful to for them to see how bad the current baseline is. It is like a very poor baseline. It's it's just we like, you read without any any clever training. And I'm not sure if we still have something from last year, when PERSON1 was working on this. Did he he leave us with any outputs? I think he has. You can you can also contact him, and he will probably respond. So the what we did back then was to train model on this on these larger data sets. The news CNN daily mirror summarization data set. And then to find unit a little on this. But I'm the I'm the experiments were not quite finished. But definitely they didn't really help. So the we are very, very much starting with with the automatic method. We we don't have anything that would work at this moment.",
            "And, yeah. And preliminary. You can't work with that. So this summarization of the meetings are very poor. So the only that can be used that if you contact him, and then, I don't know, use some but not the results.",
            "OK. So the ultimate goal will be to design this automatic minuting system are include that you can say that include that are really existing automatic minuting system. And this is analyzing the data or the ultimate goal used to.",
            "Yes, the the ultimate goal is to create a system which will automatically summarize meetings. But I think that this goal is very like far. And I do actually I do not trust that we will have a chance to build it. At the same time we let's tried let's let's go for the directly let let's really focus on that. But internally I would be happy already when we run a share task on this and have some our system there, and get to some reasonably good starting point. But at this moment, we don't have anything, which would be called reasonably good starting point. So we we are. And the very beginning we we do not have anything. So I agree, yes, the ultimate goal is to have an automatic system. But I don't think that we will get there. And the most important that we do not understand what should be done with the word. So so so to say. So, if you want to implement something that will work automatically, you need to have like a mechanistic view on on the task. And then when you have this mechanistic view. If you have some weak idea what should be read from where, and and which words should be selected, and which word should be ignored, which should, which words should be rewritten. Then you will probably propose a model technique that has some chance of success if especially in the case when you don't have training data. If we had huge amounts of of training data, we could leave this like exploratory work, to a deep neural network. But we don't have the data. So we have to use our experience and somehow simplify the task. So there is multiple possible ways. One as first to get acquainted with what the data looks like. Another option is to start syntatizing this data. So this is something that we have not tried and and someone of you could pick this up as well. You could start with summaries and generate fake meetings for for them and then train the model on this syntetic data. That that also has a chance to, to work.",
            "So I I'm not sure, so what she did right that. I have to depth deep neural network. So probably depth deep neural network would be the same, right? Or I'm like on the -.",
            "What was the beginning of your sentence?",
            "So I said PERSON3 did write the mail. And that include that PERSON5 would be developing shared task and I will be developing deep neural network.",
            "So this is this is our preliminary suggestion of what you two could work on. This is up to you to divide it differently. Perhaps, or like joined forces for while and work together on the same thing. So this is the this is our first proposition, and you can change it if you prefer something else. But I think it's it's good if people have their own goal, so feel free to change it. But if you don't change it this would be our proposal.",
            "So, I want to ask is that that network is supposed to be need for the analysis of this generated minutes? Or is it supposed to be like for generated the minutes? Or is it just for analysis, the deep network which -?",
            "For generating the summaries already. So the an for the analysis, I would use standard use which are like easy to interpret and you have have some experience in data analysis as as far as I know. So, I would start with some frequency analysis of the words that appear in the transcripts. I would check if the words that appear in a minutes then can be easily like the selected from the words in the transcripts by TF-IDF. Or if the this is this is somewhat towards the question how much the the minutes are extractive and how much they are abstractive. If the words and sequences of words in the minutes are very different, from what appears in the transcripts, then we will call it abstractive. And if it's anagrams the longer the anagrams are directly copied the more extractive we will call it. So, the analysis of what what people did for the summarization watch key indicate what type of of approach should we choose for the automatic method. If we go for the abstractive style, because people do it more abstractive, then we need to train sequences to sequences deep network, and then see that the train to find some data, which resembles, which is very similar to what what we have in the minutes. And and, or perhaps syntatizes and I said, if we realize that a lot of the meetings are extractive. Then we will instead create methods that will kind of highlight parts of the transcripts and assemble these highlighted parts together. So that we are more more extractive. It will be approach. So, the analysis of abstractivness extractivness is is useful because it kind of suggest what should be the main approach. The the the the question, whether we want to use the neural networks or not. That is just a technical question. So it's we don't have to. It is just that they are the most of the likely devise to work for the abstractive style. And there are probably the also also good device for the extractive style but having a reasonable, even rulebase baseline which is purely like implemented by hand, would be useful. Because we we do not have anything at the moment.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So did that answer your question PERSON7?",
            "Yes, PERSON6, thank you so much. I probably think and and would the better who of whether have to do. So I think I think - This the example to which PERSON3 PERSON3 that has different minutes but in meeting from the PROJECT1 description and Ltd meeting. Could this be specified like are this software summaries?",
            "Say it again please. So when in the document, there is the ASR transcript and there is if you scroll for the down, there is two meetings, right? That's very long the transcript,. Oh, that's really very long.",
            "One meeting when.",
            "Yeah, so example one example, yes, so the outline -",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, there is one thing that I also wanted to to mention the if you use the outlining the ORGANIZATION2 doc. You can easily jump with an example one on the either original ASR transcript, or the manually corrected transcripts. And you can jump to the original minutes. The original minutes are pretty detailed and this is what I originaly was hoping for. And then the generated minutes by annotator A and annotator B. These were generated by the annotators humans that PERSON3 found and and like supervised. And these generated minutes are already restricted in a way, which carry on recommended so -",
            "Actually not all of them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The instruction was to make minute most of information is the is in video and but at the same time they are not very detailed. When you - If you look at the example one generated minutes by the annotator A and annotator B you se you can see that they are very different in ranks too, so there. Annotator A made it short, much shorter than annotator B. And the annotator B made it even more detailed than the original minutes.",
            "So, well, thanks for the details. I just wanted to say that different people will have different opinions on what is good minutes. And we will have to liquid this. So, we should come up with a measure which is semi-automatic or fully automatic that will indicate or even fully manual. That will indicate how happy we are with the with the minutes. And this measure should be based on some existing experience obviously. So rouge is one of these methods but I have not really used rouge myself. That's fully automatic. For the fully manual approach, in order to be reproducible. We need to break down the task into smaller units. So that more annotators would give the the same score to the same minutes. So so imagine that we are now already running the share task. And it was humans who competed in the tasks, not the systems. And we have the original transcript as as you see it in the document. And then we have two participants. And these two participants are two of the three possible minutes that we have there. So we have the original once, A and B. So we picked that the original once, for example, could be the reference. And then we have the A and B. So I want to get a number. And the number for each of the A and B summaries. The number would say how good is the summary is. And the number or maybe more numbers should indicate whether it is adequate?. So precise, in some way, so that it doesn't say wrong things. And it should also indicate to what extent it is complete. So what the details are are missing. And for a start we could do this manualy. Each of us could like come up with some technique. What should I read in the minutes. What should I read in the transcript. How many counts should I collect there. What should I divide by what. And and and then,, arrive at a number. And we need to come up with the method for this, which by which several people would arrive at approximately the same score. So that would be a good manual method. Good manual method would be such that multiple now again. Annotators by this time scorers off of the summaries would give the very comparable scores to the to the summaries. So this is yet another task. And this task is more important for for the shared task then the preliminary explorations because in the shared task we will need to come up with the scoring of the like of rules. And we need will need to say, who was the best best in the share task. Not for the sake of of choosing the winner but for like the understanding what the results are. So it could be multiple measure is one of the competitors could be best in precision, and very bad in in in the coverage. Another could be great in coverage of reasonably precision, but very hard in truancy, or whatever we come up with.",
            "So,. That is our sharpness and the end the ASR transcript and manualy corrected transcript. So minutes are supposed to be analyzed with manual and ASR transcripts. That's the task, right?",
            "Yes and no. It's not - If we don't have a word -. Yes, if this is helpfull for you to be able to think about it, do it like that. But the assignment is very fluid. So to say. So you can -. At this moment we are starting the expiration. So we don't have any,, any like strict assignment that is what the annotators do. The annotators are given the the transcript,, first they are given the ASR output and they just listen to the sound and revise the text, and break it into sentences. This first round of annotators. Second round of annotators reads these transcripts and create the minutes the the A and B. And these are people who do not have to thing about like how to do it. They they they are in the task itself. But not thinking about the task. It's helpful for everybody to start with doing the same thing. So that you can see what you're doing. So maybe yes, maybe it will make sense for you to to read the transcript the corrected one and create your own minutes from that. And then see how your own summary differed from the A and B, and how it differed from the original one kind of. So that maybe maybe that is a good starting point. So that both PERSON5 and PERSON7 would create summary C and summary D. And you will see what you are choosing as the interesting parts. And then once you finish. You will look at what A and B did. And what the other colleague of of you did. And that way we will already have a first way idea how to do it.",
            "Yeah, now. And I say the issue you agree to do that I will send you there file and maybe and also not not these one that you haven't example but another one. So you can to always the audio maybe maybe it helps.",
            "So, PERSON3, there is one more example there, example two? Which has define minutes in the same meeting, and that in used to other meetings. Is it, is it,, an automatic system or is it this also manual one?",
            "No, both are manual. This is also -. These are also minutes by annotator one and annotator two. And just the second run. And this is an example how different of how different the minutes can look like. So, for example, for two point one may give at discussion, and you can't get the summarization is similar very well. But it's very very different in in the content. And this is big the is quite long. The annotator listens to it and chooses what he compared consideres to be important. And still annotators.",
            "It depends upon the perception and poison, that's why they are different.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Ok. Thank you so much PERSON3. I think.",
            "Similar.",
            "So if I add if I may add one more like level of thinking even high level one. I talk briefly talk about this one distant colleague and both, me and him, share the opinion that it's difficult to construct summaries if you do not know who is the target reader of the summary.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So if you have a project meeting and project meeting mixes topics on administration and the scientific content of that meeting and then some other organisation of like peoples time and whenever. Then different people will like would like to read different parts of would like to be like notified about different parts of that. So,, this is this is for PERSON5. Are you still here? PERSON5? Just checking.",
            "Hello. Hello.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So we, we have doesn't -. We've just lost PERSON7. So, the once PERSON7 recordings then.",
            "PERSON7 is not.",
            "PERSON7, PERSON7 is now not here. For some reason she she probably the conection get lost. So the the question is whether we can define the share task. So that also,, we somehow specify who is the intended reader of the summary. So if we can somehow personalize the summaries in some way.",
            "So the example would be that I will give you the the the I will to the program that the the each of the participants should create. I would give the input the which would consist of the ASR output so the full transcript. Hello PERSON7. Sorry for -.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I hope your connection is good now. I'm the the further complication the further level of abstraction, the further level of discussion that I added was that,,, meeting summaries,, should be perhaps tailored to the needs of a particularly reader. So if someone is an administrative person, they will have no interest in the technical details. If someone is the technical person, then they would be happy with just seeing one line that says administrative topics and no details about that. But they would be technical person would like to have the very much expended area expended summary on like which server was run how what programming language would these technical things how things were done. So I'm thinking if we could somehow specified the task of automatic meeting summarization. So that the input is not only the transcript the of the meeting. But also some indication some like set of questions kind of or description of what the person, who is reading the summaries, already knows. So there is either we can specify what what the person is interested in, or you can specify what the person knows, and therefore they are not that much interested in those details. So it's this is very open question. I don't have any specific proposal. One proposal could be that I will give you the ASR output for the meeting, and I will give you a a list of sentences that the person knows. And I would like you to create the summary of like what I have what new should the person read in the in the ASR transcript. So this is the this is one further possible complication. We may want to to to add, because the task of creating a summary for someone is a much more adequate from the practical point of view I would say. The task that we are giving to the annotators now like created summary of this meeting is is pretty hard. They have to summarize everything, they the the the the the yeah. I don't probably task.",
            "One more aspect is not just not not only for who you create the minutes but also who creates the minutes. So the technical person with will summarize more technical things. And the administrative person more administrative things. And then we have a students, a students or all annotators they just write down what they understand of the content. This is is is just another part of the same aspect. For whom and -.",
            "And who creates this, so the the annotators keep what they do know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This seems to be so interesting but I don't know what constraints are usualy there but it seems to me very interesting to the lot that?",
            "Yeah. Well, you ask about constraints. The constraints are up to us. We can define any constraints we like. We just need to come up with the sensible task. Sensible shared task we define our own assignment. And then we tried to fulfil the assignment. And we would describe it carefully and and clearly. The the the best description that we have, but we can depart from that is the description of work that I sent to PERSON5. And I hope I send it to you as well. Some time ago. Maybe PERSON5 if you could forward, that email then is the of that is the description of the tasks of the minuting word package. But that's that's just like an indication is not the not the necessary way to go. So,, yeah. We have too many options. We need to deliver results. A delivered result would be share task. So training data, some which would be out of domain than in-domain training data and in input inputs outputs expected and measure that would evaluate who was how successful in in that task. This is a deliberate result. This is something that we have to achieve. We should take part in this. So we should have a baseline system, which which runs this task. And doesn't perform two unreasonably and then we will have some knowledge like how to do it. How to do this summarization. And and what doesn't work. And the complication about for whom it is could be an extra step or it could be an inherent part of of this task. So I see at this point I see two extreme ways to go. One extreme way to go is to create a summary for everyone. So that nothing is forgotten. So that kind of only the structure of the dialogue is simplified. So that the statements are not repeated. And the the summary essentially very closly follows the time sequence and tries to not drop any important word. So a the summary is not very very average? It's not shorten in the text too much. This is more similar to the original summary that that you have in the document in the example one. That's one extreme. Another extreme is line, the example A an example B. These are kind of I would say high level topic,, topic and conclusions summaries. So for very long part of the of the meeting only one line is written, and that somehow tries to summarize it. So this is the the other extreme. And for this other extreme it to me it makes sense to also add the reader somehow so -. For example, if we if we represented the reader with the set of sentences that he knows. We would measure the sentences from the transcript with respect to similar to this set and the the the similarity would be high enough then we would ignore them. And that would cut down the the total content. So this is this is the two two cases I would suggest. So,, yeah, I don't, I don't know, I I I can like give you an assignment, but I would be making it up fully making it up. I don't have real experience with the data. And so I feel that this is risky. I thing it's better if you define the assignment for yourself after you have seen a few meetings yourself. And then we will like match your own definition of the assignment to the one that we need in the project. I could put you in the in the in the position of a worker who does only follows my ideas. But my ideas are pretty weak and this guidance is not not perfect. So that's why I'm like kind of hesit. I don't want to constrain your minds. That's another reason why I'm I'm not not giving you the an exact assignment like read this, implement this. I'm trying to extract the the the ideas from you.",
            "And maybe when you see the data. If you see the data. You will have more clear understanding of what you can do with that and what you can't.",
            "So I will -.",
            "Yes, please go ahead and try to speak up for go closer to the microphone.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So, professor PERSON6, do you have do you have a timeline for the share task and when you want to do that. Is there any timeline for this?",
            "No, we just have to make it up. I think it's and is a great idea to to have a timeline, like this week, for example. So the project ends with the end of 2021. So we have the rest of this year, and the full next year. And the the there are conferences planned. So the best idea would be to make sure there is a workshop that we are on a workshop for a conference. And, so if you could start with looking at the conferences, which are planned for 2021. And something which is towards the end of the year, which could be I don't know if the PROJECT3 is every year, every second year. So that could be one option. Running it was the PROJECT3 because the thence to being like November, or ACL, yeah, I'm just not sure what is what is happening at the end of next year. So we should run a workshop towards the end of the next year attached to conference and going back from this date giving ourselves sometime to like, several months to to analyse the outputs way we should come up with the schedule. And the schedule will probably require us to make a call for that call for participation at the beginning of the next year. So like in January, and really is the data in a March, for example, and then have the shared task in May or or June. And then this summer will be kind of skipped. So was September and October would be for the analysis or yeah -. So, yeah, this would be one possible schedule. So, please, PERSON5 come up with a proposal at which conference we would like to to join. Check when there have the call for a workshops. And, let's -. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So, call for proposal conference would start in September as I think. And and the submition would be October or November. For the make clear because the also start also lots of proposal together and then to divide among the conferences. So I think we should come up with a proposal by October.",
            "Great, yes. Perfect. It's great that you know this this, routine in then and that you know the dates. That's perfect. Please keep an eye on this. So that we have the proposal ready early and that we safely submitted by the required date, which, yes, I could be around the time around October.",
            "Yes. Because activity when you running a workshop at PROJECT3 and because also what list for summarization. Is it is it on already document so I don't probably submitted. So yeah. So, yeah, we can target of it.",
            "So, I again, I don't quite understand you because of the sound distorted. But you mentioned that currently you're coorganizing workshops and that includes some summarization, right? So -.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So maybe you are the best person to tell PERSON7 and us as well, what are the current best working methods for text summarization. And which of these methods seem to have a chance on the, to the speech data on the on the discussions style of origin, of input documents. So, maybe if you could prepare like a brief summarization, like overview or tutorial. Not too long, just pointers to existing systems, and what are their properties and whether they are available to to run, and so on. So that we would get some experience with that. Another person aside from you PERSON5, who knows something about this, should be PERSON4? And we should ask -. PERSON3 please ask PERSON4? He has presented something in I think Luxembourg last year on on that. So there was a workshop in Luxembourg PERSON4 attended. And he was presented our goals there and others were also presenting some summarization methods. So let's let's get this knowledge. Let's try to learn from that. So that the baseline,, in meeting summarization builds up on the baseline in replaying written text summarization.",
            "Okay. Let's get PERSON4 at the moment.",
            "Mm-hmm. Professor PERSON6 I didn't you want to do this presentation. And I'm not to regarding the and not exactly into I do have much summarization. But I can definitely be in touch with people and know in certainly and make up presentation for the group.",
            "Yes, that would be great. So, you asked about the date, the kind of so how much time do we want to give ourselves for this. So I'll be again very hard to reach during the next week. So for me, the the the best time in August, actually for me the best time would be as late as September. But to avoid slowing things down for example, Tuesday the 11th of August or Wednesday the 12th of August could be also possible. So I don't know what -. If we can do it. This, it's not too it's not too early actually from now. If if you have the time for that. I don't but -. If you have then we could plan it for Tuesday the 11th. Like a an internal workshop on available summarization models.",
            "So you can. It's not peak in all we lear and we all that we are going in the right direction. Even I help me out with that in TSED?",
            "Yes, that will be great. So the more experience we can gather the the better.",
            "So what do you think about the date? The 11th or 12th of August. Or if we wait to September then it will be much better with me.",
            "PERSON5 needs to I guess. So, I'll I'll I'll probably working from the 1st of August, because I'm I'll be leaving from my current post. So I'll be fully onto this from 1st of August. So I don't know what PERSON5. I think, is he there with us?",
            "So with PERSON5, he he would be formally available from the beginning of September. But informally, August should be also okay, right?",
            "Sorry, I no way is PERSON5 work.",
            "Maybe the connection is not working for him.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So anyway, I'll put that into my calendar for the for the 11th. And I'll put it there, for example, at the time that we have like 14: 30 LOCATION1 time. So, we on summarization perhaps internal workshop at guess there, doesn't still know you, PERSON5, you doesn't know, I'll add PERSON3 and and I'll add you later on as well. And I'll try to invite you for this column. Let's let's try to put all the experience that we have. And PERSON3, if you are still here -.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Could you also invite, if that would work, or get the old reports that we have from from PERSON1? Because we we like let that unfinished. And that's a pity. It's it would be good to to see what we what he has done, and and to start to to build up on that experience as well. This this was -. There was some serious effort put into that the data was was limited. We didn't have that much data back then yet. But still the experiment that he did was was reasonable. And we learned that the methods didn't work. But we don't want to repeat the failed attempts. We want to just read about them now.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, I'll I'll put that into your calendars as an invite. The 11th of August the time when we met. And we can change it afterwards. I'll be on my email all the time. But it's hard for me to to find focus spent of time. So that's why I, it's difficult to plan meetings. So. I I hope that you have like better idea of what the task is. And that the main task now is to defined the task. Is to to come up with the assignment. And I think it's the the easest would be really that each of you would trying to create a summary of of a meeting. And PERSON3 will send you some edited corrected ASR outputs. And and she will not provide you with the with the original transcript view, the original original summary. So you will have to create something that you saw like these A and B. And she write to create the summary in the two styles that I've discussed. First try, a detailed one, that like contains all the information. That is the style, which is more similar to the original summary that we have in example one. And then try the very much a breached which is like the example A and example B. And try to take notes on the techniques that you use. So how would you automate yourself then. Once you have done this task. So that's -.",
            "Is that for -. Yes, yes, PERSON6. That sense in -. I think that will help us to design the metric to the task one. And I think that will also help us eventually for building the system up. Yeah, so -.",
            "Okay, yeah, great. So, let me now quit the call. Feel free to continue. The call was available for one more hour, at least. I think I've I've said it PERSON3 you are also admin of this call by the way on on pexip.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, you could make it even longer. But I've I said it for two hours since when we started. So one more hour is still there.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So thanks. I'll send the invite for the call or workshop on that random date the 11th of August. And, please said take notes from this call as well. So make a make a some original summary of this meeting. And this meeting will also go through the standard pipeline that we have now with the annotators. So someone will transcribe it, and someone will create a summary for us. So this is also contributing. I hope that you agree with that. But this is also contributing to our collection of of project meetings that we need to be summarized. So you can take this one as the mental example. But PERSON3 will give you,, some other meeting, which already has the refined the manualy corrected transcript.",
            "Yes. I will.",
            "Yeah, okay, so. I'm I'm leaving, but feel free to to discuss further. Thank you.",
            "PERSON6,?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So the the task which is the share task is supposed to be a. That is part that is only for summarization or is it supposed to be need for automatic minuting. What are you focusing on?",
            "Oh, oh, what is the difference for you? For me these are synonyms. Summarization of meetings we call it minuting.",
            "Oh, suddenly what I have a that you must recreate a summarization of everything. But what needs to be done all about bad meeting. Like what up what up the objectives are minuting. Are the minutes of the meeting. So I -.",
            "Okay. Both we have not really focused on this. This is what some existing tools do. They like create action items. And then you read the action items. And that is kind of the summary. This is one way to go. I see it as a little bit formalization of these general meeting summary. So I would not force us to go for these action items, because I think it limits too much what what people can decide to do. But it is it is reasonable way to go as well. So, if if you want to reserve that minuting, for the construction of these of these lists of action items and and and decisions, or or whatever, yes, feel free to do. So. In that case, I would say we want this meeting summarization. And that summary can include these action items. But to me, this is more like further labeling classification of the final statements that we create. So, yes, this, choosing either of the two. And committing to doing one of these style of summaries. And not the other one is part of the task specification. So, before we make the call for the share task we need to make our minds on this. But we don't have to dec. I don't have the the decision at the moment. We have to arrive to the the decision ourselves until before we make the call for the sharetask. So until of the early October for example, we have to discuss this and choose which which we like better. Whether we want to go to something which is more open ended. Or whether we want to go for these limited action items. Both is is credible. We can do either of them. Both is fine. I don't have the the decision for myself yet.",
            "Okay, PERSON6. I think PERSON5 actually can hear us but he cannot speak. So, he just steps up. So he can hear all the meeting, so -.",
            "Okay, yeah, okay. So thank you. I'm disconnecting now. And hopefully you will make some sense of of this for yourself and follow us. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
            "Bye-bye. Yeah.",
            "PERSON3? Well, we are, we have us. So only questions at you. If we could like a could you one something to be total less?",
            "Do we have PERSON5? Yeah.",
            "Yeah, actually he saying that can use web summarize because actually he can he cannot start. Like -. We are able to yealing and but he is able to hear us. I don't know why.",
            "Aha, aha. Okay, okay. Actually we discovered as well what I was like I thought very good very good beginning is to got the two your. So I think in the next hours I will choose something for you and we'll send them. The date so you can download a meeting. And I think that would so you two resend to it that would be easy not just to read a transcript but also to download the video. Do you have these, do you have the possibility to download something about 600 megabytes?",
            "Yes, we can. Probably yes. And, PERSON3, one there was a, there is one one section which shared with us. Which is. With the. So we have to come up with a with a measure, which is clean to be applied to this in text, which actually has a similarity measures for the text, which are which are the meetings.",
            "Yes. So, what I meant is that you come with some measure can distinguish meet in the same meetings from the minutes from different meeting.",
            "So, there is something on Asa Jet friends text and there is something though degenerated text. So the generated text is a the D and E. The generated minutes. And I guess the reference is the one.",
            "Hello, can you hear me? Hello.",
            "Yeah, we can hear.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hello, can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, PERSON5 we can hear you.",
            "Okay. So, I was there in a meeting but I don't know why you can't hear me. I was so to the ORGANIZATION2 meeting somewhere else because I think I repeat just late there is to much effort in this record doing it somewhere.",
            "You can switch to ORGANIZATION2 Meet again if you want.",
            "But I think -.",
            "It will recording of the meeting is the really. What do you think, pardon?",
            "Yeah, that's collection of the data I guess.",
            "Yeah, we can we can finish it now and switch to ORGANIZATION2 Meet if it's better for you.",
            "Okay. So let's now continue over here, because now I think it's somewhere toolkit. But if there is a problem we can switch to the link that I shared.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Is that okay? Yeah, okay.",
            "It's not very good I can't understand all everything you -. Hello, hello? Yeah, everything you say.",
            "Yeah, I say that we just continue over here but if we can switch to the PERSON3 read for ORGANIZATION2 Meet.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yes, of course.",
            "Okay. So I was about to see that I would report to keep the presentation for the little summarization reffered in September. And by that time, I would be reaching to the export workshop who are exporting summarization and we have summarization task for. And then are comprehensive internal presentation contact.",
            "Well, okay, I think PERSON6 agree to that. So I don't -.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. So. To make clean, I want ask you PERSON3. So, I think you said that you will give us the link to the concrete data that we have.",
            "Yes, but this is link to our server. So, that's very hard data. That's a lot of megabytes. And you shared, you should have an approach there. I think, and will say, I will send you extra package of data, which include a transcripts and minutes without the audio. You don't need audio, do you?",
            "Yes, yes. I don't need. I don't need audio. Yeah.",
            "I will just, I will just the texts. And if it doesn't, if it is not enough, we will I will I'll connect you to our IT manager who can gived you give you the acces to the server. And I'm not sure it's needed. So let's let's first do the work with the texts. This is the first thing I will send you. And then I will send you the audio of the meeting for to try to make this summaries yourself. So you can as spoke about with PERSON6 some minutes before that you can try to make two types of summarizations yourself. And look at the techniques you use by summarizing.",
            "Okay. And PERSON3 I want to know. Like PERSON6 mention that you have some annotators who are doing this. So, could you share share with us the annotation guidelines? How the extract minutes?",
            "Yes, of course, I will share. Yes. I will share you the guidelines.",
            "Okay. And mention from. Oh yeah, I have e-mail. I don't know, like Doodle but do you want to use ORGANIZATION1 or maybe some other messaging instead of e-mail?",
            "E-mail is better.",
            "E-mail is better, okay, okay.",
            "PERSON5,, I don't control it often, so. It can be -.",
            "Okay, okay. I got it.",
            "I don't have it I should supportly look at. And if you don't mind I will I will just e-mails.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON3?",
            "So, because idea with the share task. The timeline. Yeah, so we are expecting guidelines and data founded, yeah.",
            "Yes, PERSON7 words.",
            "So, PERSON3, one more requesting onto me. Can you just send me request to the ORGANIZATION1? Because I was to adding people mail but since we are hurry in discussion.",
            "Request for the ORGANIZATION1?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you need disembled request. So that I can just I can I can just agree them.",
            "I'll try to. I don't really use ORGANIZATION1. I'm ordinary use it.",
            "Okay, okay, fine.",
            "So, PERSON7 I did, PERSON7 is talking about the PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION1 where where the PROJECT2 personals are there. I think PERSON6 shared to me. Maybe we have the we have the admin to share.",
            "Okay. We can breach out PERSON3 on e-mail. That's that's perfectly fine PERSON3. So, PERSON3, one one one thing I think to ask is that I was already asking. And, so datings in other to create in metrics. You are something and the generated text. From the generated text here is the DNP minutes by annotator A and B. And -. Did you say something PERSON3? I think I try to do.",
            "Engine. I just then -.",
            "In the in the in the example one in the shared document?",
            "Aha.",
            "Annotator two and generated minutes by annotator B.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So that B part of it which is.",
            "Aha.",
            "So you you required reference text so the reference text is going to be the additional. This is the generated text which you need to compare with. In other to analyse them how accurate do are.",
            "So, could you repeat,, so I so -. We have original minutes, generated minutes by annotator B and generated minutes by annotator A.",
            "Aha.",
            "Accuracy -. I didn't make, I didn't control the accuracy very detaily. Because the accuracy of original minutes themselves is also a question. So it is not always the template how it should look like. So we, so we, this is what we writ have written down during the meetings. And it's not template of what is it the best and kind of. So actually, of these three variance I have this they're not, this generated once. Maybe even more detailed and more precise.",
            "Okay. So, there is there is not a lot a standed benchmark which is supposed to be compared with all of, right?",
            "Yes. They are, all all all of them are similarly, the same value.",
            "Okay, okay PERSON3. So,, so in the matrice has just to analyse what there minutes generated minutes are abstracted or extracted.",
            "This is wrong thing but what I actually want to know if we can differentiate the minutes from the same meeting from the minutes from the different minutes meetings. What I can observe without any technology is that it's not it's not very easy. So the minutes written for the same minutes are still very different. I'm interested in if we can automatically find the measure to define to distinguish minutes for from another. And each explain us what is their what is what is actually good. If we later generate automatic minutes we can use the results of this task to say if our generated minutes are good.",
            "Okay. Right.",
            "Did you did -. Should, maybe I -.",
            "Yes, PERSON3. I I I did understood it perfectly. And so that is there are two tasking making making the automatic measures. The one is the different the all these meetings. What does the difference. So do I make a measure which could actually analyse the difference in all of the meetings, right? And one if we make the whether it's the generated meetings are extractive or abstractive.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "So the definitely meetings from one to another will actually require text similarity measure.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay. Okay, I understood kind PERSON3.",
            "So this is kind of the first step before generating befo the first step which helps to measure the quality of minutes."

This this call is again going to be recorded. And hopefully the recording will survive. And maybe we'll even have recording by individual streams of of the speakers. So I'm curious if if ORGANIZATION8 will do the job this time. So yes. Till let's wait for for ORGANIZATION3. Yeah, we have PERSON26. Yeah. So we have also PERSON26. So PERSON26, do you know if PERSON7 is going to come? And we also have PERSON25. Okay, right. Yeah. So I think that we are all, right? Great. I see most of you.",
            "Hey team.",
            "He's coming, right?",
            "Yeah, PERSON7 he's coming.",
            "Okay, yeah. So that's could we can we can halfway start and return to things that that would need PERSON7 in in a second. I said I'm happy to see at least half of you in in in like live pictures. And I hope you're doing good and not yet too crazy from the t coming Christmas season. All the e-shops are already exploding in the Czech Republic and it will get only worse. So, so I hope you have already at least some of your presents that you want to obtain for for Christmas. And yeah. We have two things that are very urgent. And that's next week, the sessions. So we'll discuss the these halfway today and and and we should also have a special technical call later on. T in principle for both PROJECT1 and the SG1. We could just push the the launch button and and see what's going to happen. But that's not the point. We we also want to make sure that we we do it a little bit better than than we did previously. So so that's why we want this extra push. Okay, but anyway, let's the last reminder this is being recorded. I hope you're fine with that. We will ask for consents to use this in the share task once we process the data, and the all your names and project names are are removed from that. So you will see what what actually could get published before it gets published. Yeah, so in the in the agenda. We start with the paymen. So on n last week, our department our financial department a week ago exactly has sent the payments. So check with your departments. Whether you have received the the payments. And confirm so that we are all good in time. Then, s the roll-up I still owe f PROJECT1 PDF of our poster. So maybe we have one in the repository. But I'm sure that ORGANIZATION4 has it. And maybe PERSON3 also has it. So I j I just would like to ask someone who has such poster to put it in the repository. And if someone could apologize for me and send it to PERSON8 to PERSON8, that would be great. It's like. So the the session is the PROJECT1 session is going to happen next Wednesday. I haven't checked the the program if well the hour is already set. But I was told that we will have one hour long slot. In which we will have Z ORGANIZATION8 room, ready for us. So I would like to do what we did with PERSON15 already. But that was not too prepared. For EAMT. So that we would be like at the background showing the the the poster, some like details about the project. But we will be primarly showing the the technology. And the participants cous could test it themselves. So this is. So so just to speak and and we would we would explain what is what is going on. And I was curious if also for the summarization for example. If colleagues of mine would like to be present in that. Because summarization meeting summarization is an equal part of PROJECT2. And we are primaly focusing on the spoke language translation. But the the presence of of summarization is there also very welcome. So if if the summarization team would like to be there, then let's just synchronise and decide what t what to present. So that's the one hour, Wednesday lunch session for a poster and demo. So.",
            "Sorry PERSON16, what what time is that?",
            "Said lunchtime, but.",
            "Yeah. I'm not sure exactly.",
            "So.",
            "Okay.",
            "PROJECT1 when did when did. Last time when I checked this, they still didn't have the the program in time sta. Now they have it, okay. So it's day 2, if I'm not mistaken. And they don't li eleventh Project Expo. Oh okay, 12: 30. And it's probably Berlin time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So Project Expo, that's that's it.",
            "Okay. Thanks. And if it's a ORGANIZATION8 room, do you need a host or or is it. I mean, the thing is you you have a couple of nice overview slides with data.",
            "Well. So they they ask for a poster.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "They ask for project details. I wrote something. And they also ask for poster. So I assume they will be p like putting the posters somewhere. As.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Entry to that room.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And in that room, what we saw at the EAMT session, people were jumping in at at random times.",
            "So there should always be some visual information, so that they could synchronize.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "With the current flow of the discussion. And then later ask their questions. When when when everybody else is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Exhausted, so. Yes.",
            "Sorry on which day was that? First, second or third?",
            "Second, the second day.",
            "Second, so that's December second. Okay.",
            "So Wednesday, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so sorry, I forgot about the date. Yes. So the. When I was talking about the demo for the SLT. We can cover that, obviously with the support of your systems. Live and and running. But we don't need you p i as persons there. And for the minuting we also can do it s ourselves. If if my minuting colleagues agree to to do something. But I would definitely like you to invite you to to be present there. So if anybody would like to s come to the poster or to the demo as well to see it, it is useful to to see how the system behaves. Every time,. Yeah. So so just let me know. And just enter this into the document and and get in touch. And we also want to use this PROJECT1 as demo for as dry run for the full conference translation. And we will get the ORGANIZATION8 links and PERSON2 is working on the. PERSON2 is also on the call today. He's working at the domain adaptation.",
            "So he has probably scraped the websites of PROJECT1. And he's adding some other on dom s docks and and whatever. Well, there's obviously a lot of content that could be used. So I don't exactly know where in which direction he's he's crawling. But it should definitely include some of the speakers' names and all that. And also PERSON2 suggested to test it on past talks from the speakers. If they're for example available on YouTube, which is quite possible for some of those. So. That is good. But primaly, I really like to have this evaluated with numbers on our PROJECT2 test set. So I hope that PERSON1 and and my other colleagues are working on that. So we should have some numbers. And this is an invitation for everybody who has some modal components, which could be useful. But we don't know their performance. S in our setting. Please get in touch with, primarily PERSON14 or PERSON2,. And possibly also with PERSON1. And have your components evaluated. With the PROJECT2 test set. And then we will see whether we should put a lot of effort into integrating those or whether it's it doesn't seem as as a worth enough improvement.",
            "And what. What do we need to collect from this this this demo? I mean in terms of like.",
            "Reporting. For.",
            "Yeah, so things that we can collect that we can reuse in later date. I mean is there anything that we can collect or is it just about putting.",
            "Well the it's now quite likely that the ORGANIZATION11 congress itself will be postponed so late. We're we're not sure. It it could happen next autumn. But it could also be postponed beyond the.",
            "The project, yeah.",
            "And sh then in that case the next PROJECT1 PROJECT1 2021 would be probably our event. I know it's not ideal.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because it's spoken in English only. But in that case all the materials including the domain adaptation are very relevant.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And all the like domain adaptation procedures that we will exercise for this are are relevant. I know that the ASR domain adaptation should become less important as we have the full neural systems in the pipeline. And ORGANIZATION3 has them, but I'm not sure. Maybe if if you could tell us if if they if these ASR systems can be tested live next week.",
            "The the new ones? The.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Probably not. I mean English yes.",
            "Yes English? Of course. It's only non-native English spoken.",
            "Yes, so so PERSON26. So we have the. We we can run the enter inner system, right?",
            "Yes, it's running.",
            "And is it. So it's integrated in the in the metadata, right?",
            "Yes. So last time we did, we we we run both the the hybrid system and the the new MT system. So it's it's basically it's running. We we too different input.",
            "Okay, so that is very important for us to know. Very important for PERSON14. And I would really like to have these systems evaluated on on the PROJECT2 test sets. So PERSON14, I hope that you're listening. So this is this is something that please synchronize with PERSON26. And really get this system get these two systems evaluated head to head. And also s it's a. So there is two types of evaluation. One is like separately just the word iterate for the ASR. And the second thing that is also very important is how this system behaves when it's connected in the SLT pipelines. And we know from the past, that even if the system is better in terms of word iterate, it may have slightly different like s behavior with respect to sentence boundaries. And it can make a worse effect for the machine translation. So this has to be tested as a complete pipeline as well. So it's two tests. You need to test the component alone. And you need to test the component with the with the for pipeline. And it's quite possible that we would for example decide to use the fully neural system for the ASR only, when presenting English subtitles. But we would use the old s cascaded ASR for the SLT pipeline, where we were further translating it. So that's that is all possible and we have to have numbers to to decide what what works better. Yeah. So this is.",
            "I'm sure I'll get in touch with him.",
            "Yeah, okay, great. So this is very important. And yeah. So that's the continuous testing. PERSON14 is the main person. So PERSON14 is the main person. So please get in touch with PERSON14. PERSON14 will be collecting all the details, like the ORGANIZATION8 links. And he will be running the systems, all that. Obviously his situation is not ideal, because he's starting the systems from an X to go session. So he like remotely connects to a local machine. Here in LOCATION2. From India. And he clicks the ORGANIZATION8 up there. And runs the systems from our machine. But operates them from India. And also, due to some power f like power supply faultage, they he lost the power supply, the the adaptor for his notebook and and cell phone on the same day. So he now has some substitute ones and another power failure he may have to travel 500 km to buy new adaptor, so. So ha be happy that you are in Europe and your power lines are not that bad.",
            "Yeah. So this is. We also are trying to to have like substitute people in case it this hits PERSON14 again.",
            "PERSON11 is in Germany, so yeah. We have we have some fall back options. But hopefully it will work out well. So it's. We probably will need to discuss many more technical details. So here's the doodle link,. Technical coordination. And and it involves it will involve the technical coordination, not only for the PROJECT1, but also the SG1 meeting. Which is on the 4th Thursday. If I'm not mistaken. So the on that day, we will have we will need two systems running at the same time. One should be the computer linguisti computational linguisticS domain. And the other should be the e ORGANIZATION11 domain. And the like congress planning. So this SG1 w they will be exactly discussing the postponed ment of ORGANIZATION11 congress. And what to do and and they will probably talk about the program and and things like that. So please, fill in this doodle.",
            "The SG1 is on December 3rd, not 4th. Sorry.",
            "Yeah, ok yeah. Yeah. So but it's it's Thursday. Thursday next week. So please fill in this doodle. It's for the upcoming few days. And then we'll discuss. And I'm curious, so you well. Please enter yourself, what you can provide for these test events. So if we have any new bilingual modals. If we have any new multilingual modals. If we have any better ASR, especially for non natives. So this is yes, this is so. This is the the NN ASR by ORGANIZATION3. And then for the domain adaptation, it occurred to me that both of them can can talk about COVID. Because it's topical. So maybe it may be worthwhile to add these two corpora to our training data. Somehow. Like to fine tune a little bit on that. I'm. So that's this is just a random random thought. We could also add them to the dictionary for the ASR for the for the adaptage ASR, that PERSON26 is preparing. Sorry sorry, that not PERSON2, that that PERSON2 is preparing, not PERSON26. Yeah. So for the event, we are likely to have three ASRs. The standard cascaded ASR. The domain adapted cascaded ASR that PERSON2 is preparing also with PERSON17. And the fully neural ASR from ORGANIZATION3. I don't know whether there is any way to any use of of domain adaptation like extending the the the language modal data, if they're. Whatever. B for. Then there might be another version, but I don't expect that, so please let me know. And if you have any other ideas, what we could do, then yeah. Let us know. So the question is also on ORGANIZATION6. In what way are we going to present these? So for the PROJECT1, we'll be connecting to ORGANIZATION8 calls and I'm don't know whether these ORGANIZATION8 calls will be broadcasted. If they were broadcasted via YouTube, we could like use the subtitle view under the the broadcast session. But this is something that we have not considered yet. And for the SG1 group, we know that the participants will not be looking at the subtitles. So t it would be only like the organizers of that meeting they already saw our system in LOCATION1 last year. And they were not so happy about it, so it's. So that's let's let's show it to them only when when it works very smoothly. So let's let's run this test under cover. But I'm wondering what is the presentation option there? We're definitely working on having two separate instances of the paragraph view. So the paragraph view will be covered. But s PERSON13 you're of course invited to do something about the the presentation. If you decide to to use it for one of the sessions, one one of the events, that's that would be sufficient. The PROJECT1 might have a video. Talk to PERSON8, if if that would be happening. Or maybe it's on the on the PROJECT1 webpage, I haven't read it. The SG1 will be definitely without video, so in that case, we would just hide the video box and have have the multiple languages. So decide which which. And and get in touch with PERSON14. So that he's shipping the correct streams to the correct presentation workers. So that is that is to be like checked. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Yeah. So that's that's what I had in mind for these two events. And then I see that there's some details about ORGANIZATION11 congress and saw activities. That's probably from PERSON23. And actually I haven't realized if he's on the call or not. The fate of congress.",
            "He's not, he had a power shortage.",
            "Or not not. Or the internet connection went bad. So he's apologizing that he's not here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I wrote that.",
            "Yeah. So yes. So the information is not changed from last time. The con the congress is probably or possibly going to be divided into parts. Yeah. So PROJECT2 has applied to be able to participate in the online only part, which is already in April. So somewhat earlier than we planned. So this is important for our system development. So it's it's shorter deadline. And the physical meeting with workshop and marketplace will be postponed until it's safe. So we'll we'll see. And yes. So we have. And we have the the testing of the room for the SG1 group on on Wednesday next week. Yeah, so this is there's actually no news here. So let's quickly remind ourselves of the deliverables. And then I would also like to very briefly hear about the progress in the individual workpackages. I'm I'm sorry for such a late notice, such a late request. But since this is your daily bread and butter, it should be very easy for you. To just briefly say what is what is the status. So you can fill some of the details already below the tables in now. Or you can do it when you are talking or after you are talking. So now for the deliverables, yes. So the plan is to have almost full text ready early in December. And I would like to t have a confirmation from everybody listed here, that the that the deliverables are in reasonable progress. So the 1 point 5 final training data, separating confidential and public version. So.",
            "Yeah, so. There is an overly f document for this. Actually I could just copy the link in here. Maybe, yeah. So I've invited some members of the consortium directly to contribute to that. I should send down the consortium wide email as well. Just in case they're there's work on training data, that that I'm not aware of or is in a different state than I expect and can also be added. But, yeah. I think we're looking good on that.",
            "Great. Thank you. So PERSON15, you're on the call, right? Yes. Strange, you are unmuted, but we cannot hear you. So PERSON15's. PERSON15 also probably has some template. But I don't know the status and yeah. The microphone is probably not working. So can we move to then the. Okay. So the 6 point 2 is is going to be postponed, so that's easy. And then the integration. I don't know if if PERSON13 or ORGANIZATION4 is is going to give the status of this.",
            "Yes. W. We get in touch in order to define the the structure of the document. And we start putting in it content we are pretty at a at a good point. We are definitely on schedule and we hope to finish it for the year.",
            "Hello, hello.",
            "For the early December.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Great. And I heard PERSON15 now, so now it works. PERSON15, yes. Please go ahead.",
            "Yes. So I started the template and before I I will go on. And I would like to know what should be there. Cause in last deliverable there were thirteen pages. In the last year. So whether to repeat them, or to make it briefer. Make it shorter.",
            "Or. Only reference the the old content.",
            "S. Well. This is a progress report. So definitely not repeating any of that. It should be mainly a summary of or. Someone is deleting accidentally deleting the cells in the table, yeah. So definitely we should list all the relevant papers, that we have there. And these should be included in the appendix. And I know that ORGANIZATION12 has some good work there. So that's definitely the thing there. And for tasks which do not have a paper yet, there should be p a page of description of the news. And obviously referring back to the previous deliverable but not not copying it verbatim.",
            "So yeah. So for the ORGANIZATION12 paper, I think the best is. Well, PERSON26 could write it. But probably the best is to contact PERSON19 about that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Because PERSON26 is also busy with the PROJECT2 deliverable as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "So.",
            "And ORGANIZATION3. Do you also have some multilingual MT experiments, or papers? I forgot.",
            "Yes we do. And I had already talked to PERSON30 and he wanted to contribute.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'll I'll put a comment into the tables so that he has.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So.",
            "But PERSON30 PERSON30 said so for this year essentially, it's mainly system building.",
            "Yeah. That's well. Still it's work that should be reported, otherwise it's forgotten. So it's. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And maybe ORGANIZATION6, do you also have yours systems, or or not? But these are probably not multilingual for machine translation?",
            "Sorry?",
            "I was wondering whether you also have s anything on the multilingual machine translation. Or or machine translation. If there is any.",
            "N.",
            "You don't have to have.",
            "I I can ask.",
            "Just ask around. In case there is there is some work. So the point is that what we don't report s the the reviewers will not now. So this is like a connecting of all the fruits that we already have. So.",
            "I I will ask to our research lab.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you. Yeah. So that as ESET deadline is the 6th of December. And then it will go to the reviewers. We have the reviewers kind of decided, right? G s yeah. Yep, yeah, yes. So A and CC. Yeah, so that's. That's.",
            "Yes. The reviewer will probably be our researcher PERSON5.",
            "In any case put me in CC.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. And and you agree to do the review of the data deliverable, right? PERSON13? Can I delete the question mark on the first row?",
            "Last time this we discussed above the possibility to let me launch -",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "The 1 dot 5. He was pretty.",
            "Keen on doing that.",
            "New. At the subject.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But me too.",
            "I'll ask him. I'll ask him.",
            "But after he was. He. It's not a problem for him to review it. Of course, it's more a matter of syntax review and.",
            "Meaning review. Okay.",
            "Okay, great. So so we will see and we will update it according to. So once once PERSON23 confirms. Yeah. And the milestones. We have the improved ASR systems, that's okay. That's one tick off a box. And it's in progress. So I I asked last time, if you could t also include all the other languages in the mediator so that we could use them. I hope that PERSON26 has successfully defended.",
            "Yeah, so we're not training. So there will be more and more as we as the training once finish.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "So. I've I mean I German is updated next. French is in the making. Italian will come soon. And then of course Czech. And Welsh as well, so.",
            "Okay, so that's great. So you will also have Czech? That's that's good news.",
            "Well, we have. We don't have it yet. So we.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We have the data that you that could improve train something on that data. Plus the other available data that's out there, you know, common voice etc.",
            "Yeah. I'm definitely very much curious about that, because that will be like s comparison between those who know the language but not ASR. And those who know the ASR but not the language.",
            "We'll basically one cookie cutter you know the standard recipe on top of the data. And see what happens.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So but it it's quite possible that you're your cookie cutter will be better than ours.",
            "In the end, it all depends on the amount of training data. But the training data that you provided is comparatively larger if I remember correctly, right? It's a couple two hundred, three hundred thousand, something like that, right?",
            "I remember four hundred, but.",
            "Four hundred could even be more, yes. It was something that sounded like it could could work. And if we add common voice and other stuff that's out there, ORGANIZATION2 etcetera. Hope would be that it that it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That it produces a good system.",
            "Yeah. And you are training these other languages with the neural architecture.",
            "Exactly. So from now on, we'll only train neural and systems.",
            "Yeah, that that's great. Because we have Kaldi based system. And our neural systems are by PERSON17. But they're not integrated in any way. They we don't have the onlinization f yeah. So. If if we could work on this. Or if we could get some tools from you, think about it. It would it would help us. A lot. Because we have other implementations. You have your own neural, fully neural implementation, I guess. PERSON17 is relying on just.",
            "Yeah, so we have our own. Exactly.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so that would be great. If we could get it from you. Or well, we could stay also only in the experimentation area and not in the deployed systems area with our systems.",
            "I mean. So depending on what level your system works, we could also try to integrate i.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that. Yeah. So I'll I'll talk to PERSON17 and try to like get PERSON17 in touch with PERSON26, right? He's. PERSON26 is here?",
            "Yeah, PERSON26 and PERSON26 can also t k bring in touch with another colleague, who can help maybe with integration.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "So they have a lot of experience when it comes to integration. So maybe there is something that can help.",
            "Yeah, okay. Great. Thank you. So that's it. And the improved spoken language translation prototype,. So f well it's in the ORGANIZATION12 workpackage. So that's why ORGANIZATION12 is the main responsible there. It's. I think it's it's for us to decide what we want there.",
            "So what do w.",
            "It's it's absolutely for us. Yes. I don't know what our plans are yet. There. I guess that means that we. Yeah. Yeah. I have to talk a bit more with PERSON26 about that. But we should have, we should have some story about how we made the spoken language translation better.",
            "Yeah. So the the last time when we discussed this, we said that the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Main like background information behind this tick off a box will be the report from the PROJECT2 test set and SLTF.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Evaluating the different versions of that.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah.",
            "And. My colleagues are working on this, so. We can s take the next week's opportunities, the two events. And the preparation for those when we should have the numbers ready.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As the try run for for this. And then we will if we are not in time with all these systems for the next week's events. Yeah we can still add them in the coming weeks and we'll have like more complete table. But this, this table of of system versions and the evaluation of the individual components, as well as the whole pipeline, would be the the basis for our confident yes to this.",
            "Okay, okay, yeah. Yeah, no it would be very good to see that. And then we can - Cause we. I don't I haven't seen any kind of figures on the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In in the evaluation of the pipeline in terms of the -",
            "So well there are some figures in the in the August deliverable, the test sets. But that was mainly to show that we a can in principle evaluate it.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it was the the table in that deliverable was obtained by PERSON24. PERSON24 is now on the call as well. Yep. And PERSON24 is rejoining the the project. He has limited time for that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it's ten hours per week, so not much. But he should be exactly like pushing to get this table updated. And and and PERSON14 is now the main operator of the systems.",
            "And PERSON24 would be the the main person putting the numbers together to a sensible table so. So if you have any questions then ask PERSON24. And PERSON24 will probably ask me, but. Yeah. So, yeah. So PERSON24 should be the main person behind this the summary of the systems.",
            "And since you are PERSON24 starting already next week. Please be in touch. So also please fill the doodle poll that is listed there at at the top of this document. And even if you cannot make it to this tech to these preparations, then please be in touch. And help PERSON14 to to get the numbers so that we decide for the best systems for the next.",
            "Okay. I will take a look at it.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So that should that should work out within the months that with the month that we have. So that should be okay. Thank you. So now we can probably. We have twenty minutes or or so. We can quickly go over the workpackages. I'm happy that you all have entered all the details. But I would like also you to present it now. So that everybody listens to that and and maybe there will be some new ideas for collaboration. Remember, we have to show collaboration. So the more we find, the better. Yeah. So PERSON26, probably? Can you -",
            "Sure. So yeah. I've been continuing to work with the data set from the. From the European court of auditors. And so this is English into the other twenty three ORGANIZATION1 languages. I've been evaluating a f like fine tuned system. Using the PROJECT2 test set. And finding that this yeah. In domain auditing data actually doesn't seem to be helping. So not sure what's going there. Like s. The looking at the data and it seems mostly good. It's a little bit noisy. So yeah. I've been doing some like language identification type processing to yeah. Clear out sentence pairs, that seem to be maybe in the wrong language. And I'm cleaning up some formatting issues. And throwing out some strange short sentences. And yeah. Making gradual incremental improvements on that. I I was meaning to ask actually, PERSON16. I shared the the English Czech version with I th I think it was PERSON6. A while ago at ORGANIZATION10. I don't know if you heard anything about the evaluation of that?",
            "No?",
            "No.",
            "No, okay.",
            "So maybe maybe do that again. Because PERSON6 has been the substitute for PERSON24 for a while.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But he was also busy with other things. So, so please send it again.",
            "Okay.",
            "Also to PERSON24. I I had. I talked to PERSON6 yesterday. So i he just didn't mention that, so.",
            "Okay, yeah. It was a while ago. Ago now, if anything came out of the evaluation from that. So okay, I'll I'll follow up with him.",
            "Yeah. And the the result that it's not showing any improvement. I think that we should really look deeper into that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "T PROJECT2 test set is is quite like broad and messy in some way. So I would be curious to see if some of the documents show the improvement. So it's possible that you do not see any improvement on the whole. It's possible that you see the improvement only on the text style of documents. So PERSON6 has been collecting those for a number of languages. And more are still in the pipeline. And there are also the presentations from the previous meetings. Those that were used in the IWSLT non native tasks. The the my ball and and so on. And this is spoken domain in in the auditing.",
            "Okay. Okay. I don't think I knows, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so there is ther. So please get in touch with D PERSON24 and also well PERSON14. And PERSON1 and and PERSON6.",
            "Sure.",
            "And all of those and put together like both a detailed evaluation for the individual documents. And a summary evaluation over the domains. So this is something that PERSON24 has the the best but a little outdated overview of.",
            "Okay.",
            "And PERSON6 has been slightly updating it. But only with individual contributions. Yeah? PERSON1, your your microphone is is lifted. So you're too quiet.",
            "That, aha.",
            "Yep.",
            "Is it okay now?",
            "Yep.",
            "Sorry. Just about this evaluation. Maybe if y i. Because i yes, I maybe we should talk ten or fifteen minutes. After this call. And we can you know conclude about the timing. And when. For example this evaluation of the this system should be ready. If you want them for example fast, maybe we can talk and create one timetable for it.",
            "Yeah, that's a good suggestion. I'm attending call from 11. So I'll leave this call and mal I'll make a.",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "Yeah, you are.",
            "I also. I also have a meeting directly after. We ca we can arrange something for another time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Or maybe we'll be fast enough and the nine minutes will be will be sufficient.",
            "Maybe.",
            "Okay, thank you. So now PERSON15. A brief summary of the.",
            "Yeah, so. So we had a paper at PROJECT3 about document level evaluation. And about ORGANIZATION12 and ORGANIZATION3. I don't know the details. So if som if PERSON26 or PERSON7 can s can say a few words.",
            "Again, on what? On the.",
            "Yes, about the new content that PERSON30 writes us.",
            "So. The new c. That PERSON30 writes us? I I for for the multingual, yes? So.",
            "Yes.",
            "PERSON30 has been. Well he did his PhD on multilingual ASR. And he has ever since then been training different types of multilingual ASR systems. And so lately, he has trained different types of ASR multilingual ASR systems, that can do 5 by 5 or 10 by 10 languages. And has experimented with different language mixtures. And etcetera. So he should be able to describe what he did and provide evaluation with that.",
            "Okay. And is it about translation, or more ASR?",
            "No, it's about translation.",
            "Okay.",
            "So multilingual MT.",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Yes.",
            "And in ORGANIZATION12, PERSON26?",
            "I'm sorry. I'm not sure, are you referring to the test week's paper, PERSON15?",
            "Anything newer relevant to machine translation.",
            "Oh, okay. Yeah. So well. When I said PERSON15, I already. PERSON15 jumped to workpackage 4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I was thinking that you would tell us briefly tell us about the ongoing ORGANIZATION2 and preliminary session.",
            "Sorry.",
            "That's actually. Oh sorry, that's because we have yes. The ORGANIZATION2 sessions are used for many things. So I know that you are working on the interpretation corpus. And this is actually minuting. So this is rather the the minuting people. So yeah.",
            "Yeah, but do we. What do we get from the ORGANIZATION2? I mean, can we get simultaneous the speaker and the interpreter? Can we get the s.",
            "This is what PERSON15 is collecting.",
            "Yes.",
            "That's what PERSON15's collecting. And transcripts, do we have transcripts to any of them?",
            "We we are getting manual transcripts for ten hours of Czech and German. Right now. It's running. The transcription.",
            "So with people.",
            "Okay. Okay.",
            "So only defen test set.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But still. I mean still that's useful. So that's gonna be like the. The original speakers speaking and the simultaneous and it's a simultaneous interpretation?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, okay. Okay. Czech, German. Okay. Alright.",
            "Yeah, so that was. He. You've heard the updates. So that is actually another d item. S PERSON15 s.",
            "And. And does the ORGANIZATION2 does it come with any transcripts? Or is it just. The the stranscripts are very. They're not verbatim transcripts, is that right? Or are they.",
            "Yes. Yes, they're transcripts of the force. And they are updated most of the time they. They match what was said. But tha something is sometimes, it changes. And we. We are interested only in the speeches of the members of ORGANIZATION2. Not not f not of the President, because he's not written. Where bostly most of the time. It's live.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So there is some. The the some existing verbatim transcripts of.",
            "No, I don't choose them. I don't have access to them.",
            "Okay. Okay. Alright. Well that probably means we don't we don't have them then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because essentially all the data is public, isn't it?",
            "Yeah. But there is also ORGANIZATION2-ST corpus from someone.",
            "From Valencia.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they use it for speech translation. For speech to text. So we don't overlap them. But we aim to extend them. By interpretation.",
            "Okay. Kay, good. But the. The Valencia corpus from what I remember, it was not that big. I mean it thought it was smaller than the corpus.",
            "Yes.",
            "Because they they used only the part which was translated 2008 to 11.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that's these speech corpora. And the minuting corpus is also in progress, right? I guess PERSON10 knows the details? I don't know if he's?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yep, yeah, oh there you are the first.",
            "Yes.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yep.",
            "So the minuting corpus is like one review reviewer. The different base in the ORGANIZATION2 data. So now there's some there is some minutes and the transcripts for which that are very noisy. As well as that doesn't make that much sense in terms of minuting. So we are on the way to eliminate those. And currently, we have almost a more than nine thousand segments of meeting meeting and minutes aligned data. But I I think after pre-processing it will get reduced.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So. I hope by the by like by early December the data sets should be ready for minuting.",
            "So that would also fit nicely to the deliverable on the data.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay, great.",
            "And a little bit. We have just begun to align co minutes to transcripts. And and we are working a lot with alignment too. So we really preparing new data set with aligned data sets. So we're really hard, working hard on alignment now.",
            "Great, thank you. So for the ASR we have heard already from ORGANIZATION3. They're returning all the systems, that's good. Yeah. Found more data. Okay. That's another piece of news. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so it's. It's nothing special. But we found. I mean we are now working with common voice and ORGANIZATION9. And there's also a Librispeech German corpus. That we're now going to put in there as well.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So that's great. So for SLT,. Is PERSON9 to summarize?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yep. Okay.",
            "Yes. So we're really just. So so is really just not a long starter. And there's sort of just trying to see where we are in SLT. And what we're interested is is trying to do simultaneous and end-to-end SLT. But this is kind of well. It's slightly ambitious of a moment where. Partly, we're just investigating what tokens are right there. What is actually implemented. And he has been running some experiments, at least there is some some code. That actually started to come out with some of the existing approaches implemented. There's some code from ORGANIZATION5 Asia. And he's been running running experiments to wait unobserving. But it does not. Well. For obvious reasons, it it is quite problematic with verb final languages. So. Thinking about how we could you know what we can do about that. Whether you have to. Yeah. Well they have to try to make some prediction. Or you know, you're going in the other direction, you may want, you may have to, you know. You're going into a free word or a language. Sometimes you just have to make a bad decision and reorder things a bit. That's why I was asking about the intepretation. Cause we're still sort of curious as as to what human interpreters do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's gonna be.",
            "So.",
            "Czech and Czech and German. We might struggle with that. But.",
            "Yeah. So when when I send the link to the SLT tutorial -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Have responded with the meaningful units. And this is exactly the idea that I had except w obviously they were.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We. We we were talking about that as well. Or something like that. But it it it's. You know, the papers. The paper's not the last word I think on meaningful units, you know, so.",
            "Yeah, so. Yeah so. I've I've already forwarded like before actually sending the notification about this tutorial. I sent another notification to PERSON15 about these meaningful units. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I hope that we should be able to actually see the meaningful units from the interpreters' data.",
            "Yes.",
            "And maybe. Make already. Has some statistics on that, I'm I'm not sure.",
            "Yeah. But there's lot of questions about how you actually make this prediction model. Cause you know, you got to predict what these meaningful units are. And it's not really clear from the paper how good a job they did.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As a set, they only tested. They didn't test on any kind of. Unless what. The has a really nice work. But it's stuff they publish is never on what you assume they're actually running the system on. Cause it's always publish in like PROJECT3 2014.",
            "Newstask in like while that's like that's not a speech corpus. That's.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's all very much written text. So. Yeah. So I don't know. And nothing is ever released, which is quite frustrating.",
            "Cause is. I I watched have watched by just over a half of the tutorial. And it's by and ORGANIZATION7.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they're telling is. But I mean it it's really, it's actually very nice. Especially, who's very clear. And it's really good explanation of all these different papers, but. Almost none of them are available.",
            "The papers? Wh.",
            "As in the code, the implementations.",
            "The code, the implementations. Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Th by and ORGANIZATION7 stuff is not available. Facebook have start publishing some stuff.",
            "Which is we should take a look at.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And as I said, we don't have anything in PROJECT4. Which is.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which is.",
            "Bad.",
            "Problematic in terms of our kind of. Well, if we want to actually to d test stuff in deployment.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I mean we can we can deploy with but it's going to be a bit slower, I suppose.",
            "Yeah, it's it would be much better to have with PROJECT4 in PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So do we have anyone on the team who could do these changes in PROJECT4, so?",
            "Well, yeah. There's nobody. The PROJECT4 team here are just folks on things like efficiency.",
            "So I I don't have a com corrupt anyone to doing. I di I talked to PERSON22 about it a while ago. And he hinted that ORGANIZATION5 were doing something in SLT. But haven't seen anything. And maybe I've got that wrong. Maybe they're just not doing it.",
            "So yeah. I I need to look at it again. I mean he did seem to suggest that you you know to. To implement the decoding of some of, then you would probably need to do the G2, GPU programming.",
            "Cause everything. You know w. The translation is very much done. And the GPU in in PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that's kinda makes it specialist.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "So. Wh.",
            "At the moment there's no prospect. The the.",
            "It doesn't look good at the moment. But possibly. I mean we'll keep going here. I think we can probably add somebody extra to the team here, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Possibly.",
            "Yeah, we should also try t like keep searching. So thi if anybody is very fluent in C and and in in CUDA, then yeah.",
            "Yeah. It mine. It might not involve that much CUDA. Y I I'm not really sure. I think we just need to.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so possibly some students of PERSON1 could could emerge. That's just my random thought. But I'm not sure.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I mean I have a slight hope that I might be able to convince PERSON27 to do something with it. But it's w.",
            "He's working on at the moment. So I'm not sure.",
            "Yep, yeah, yeah.",
            "So. I have to. He's fond he's fond grants, so at the moment.",
            "Yeah, so yeah so that's.",
            "It's not really gonna work.",
            "Yeah, so that's not going to work.",
            "But we'll keep an eye on that anyway.",
            "So. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so that's it's good that we discussed this. And we'll see what what we can do about it.",
            "Yeah. And sorry. I was wondering at the moment in the in the production pipeline. We're essentially. I mean some versions I've seen have had quite high latency, because we were just waiting for the ASR to stabilize.",
            "Is that right? Before.",
            "It.",
            "It depends which version.",
            "It depends on. It depends what what you have seen exactly. If you're have looked at the subtitles in the subtitle view. Then we set the flicker to to zero. So that it's legible.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "In the paragraph view, we always present everything.",
            "That's true actually, yeah.",
            "So so there the latency is not that bad. But you have to have more space. So we're actually running.",
            "Yes.",
            "A study on on how much space in practice you you need. So that study is is in preparation. And hopefully.",
            "I saw that, yeah.",
            "Like next week we'll start giving this to people to to watch videos with subtitles. Of varying space. And checking how much content they get in the various set ups. So hopefully we will have a user study.",
            "Yeah. And we're running a re-translation, is that right?",
            "B yes. That's the the systems that we have. So it's.",
            "Of course, re-translation, yes yes.",
            "Yep.",
            "Okay. So how do. How do then do we manage the flicker?",
            "So we're increasing the latency with these subtitle. The tools that I implemented where you simply hide the segments which are not yet completed. Or you keep them in. But then you have the.",
            "The words jumping.",
            "Okay. So it's like a mask A type approach. Like you mask. You know. The the transl.",
            "Yo. You mask sentences. You mask full sentences. Yeah.",
            "So the translations system sends them out. But then you don't you just don't show it.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right. Right.",
            "Yes. And we have also an option to mask k last words. But we don't choose it. In this study, we have mask zero.",
            "Okay. So I believe you're gonna mask. You mask sentences.",
            "S well we call it flicker, which is either showing only the completed sentences. Or the sentences which are still which can still change, because the segmentation of them can change. Or we can also show the very last one of these. Which is still getting words.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it's like three levels. Of of the flicker.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we're going to explore this. But essentially already the previous to the conclusion was that with the limited space it's better to have just the f completed seg sentences that cannot change.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we are not masking any words. But as as PERSON15 says, we we have the option to hide some words. If the empty output was stable to some extent. But it's not. At the moment, w i we have no stability component in in the MT systems at all. So there is no really no benefit to be expected from this weight K. Or z they mask masking of K.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Words.",
            "Yeah. I mean it it's interesting that the. In the work, they never rea. Well. I think there's maybe one paper where they use some kind of. They never really used it. With re-translation, there is one paper where they have something where you can delete. And and update. But mostly they use weight K. And then adapt and so on, various ways of adapting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They're essentially monotonic as in the re-translating.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You never go back the way. I don't know if that's. Again, it's it's sort of unclear what they're doing in the real systems, so is that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because of because of.",
            "So this is this is.",
            "Observation from the real system.",
            "The room for our papers. We we.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This is this is where we what we should publish in our papers.",
            "Yeah. This this kind of. Well. We definitely have a lot of observational. You know. This this this sort of demo stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So.",
            "Okay. Cause. Sorry.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. So we have just two more minutes. So on machine translation. Yeah. So yeah. PERSON15 has already solicited new information from from you. So please fill in these details. I don't know is there PERSON15, is there anything we need to say for the MT workpackage?",
            "I don't think so.",
            "Yeah, okay. So let's move on to the minuting. The data is in preparation. The manual evaluation has been tested to some extent. The automatic evaluation is probably being implemented by PERSON21. So that we have many options in place, right? PERSON21? Can you?",
            "Yes. Yes, yeah.",
            "Yeah. And we are working on s. Yeah, the wha the line. And novel meeting minute alignment metric for coverage is in progress. So here the idea is that human annotators would be matching the transcript lines with the items in the summary. With the alignment. And then based on this alignment, we would c automatically calculate a score that would say how much of of the transcript was covered by the the summary. So this is the the similarity to agement is to the if if you remember agement. There were the semantic roles labeled in the candidate translation and in the hypothesis. And they were aligned manually. And then there r was the estab a number showing like how much the alignment is good. And what is the coverage. So that's the inspiration. So we have the alignment between the elements and then the automatic calculation. So this is this the progress. Then PERSON21 is also working on survey for this. And so have we submitted the share task proposal deadline on December? Yeah? So we should in a few days we should submit the proposal for the share task. On automatic summarization of meetings. Right? So PERSON10 PERSON10 is on top of this. Yeah. Y we have already discussed this. So you are well invited to to take part as participants. Or help with the organization. Yeah. I really d would like to leave now. So the for integration, PERSON13. Is there anything very important?",
            "No.",
            "Okay.",
            "We recent. About the possibility on the how to manage versioning among components. Mainly thanks to PERSON14 and PERSON25. Of course. Which always supports us. At the moment we decided to postpone this discussion after the next two events.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I I have also two other notes. Unfortunately, for ORGANIZATION6, this is a really really busy period.",
            "Until probably the end of January. So we will of course support you. Always. And as we can. But please consider this also. We probably will n we will not be so present during the next technical meetings. Sorry.",
            "Yeah. Okay. I just wanted to mention that PERSON6 is working. On the packaging of that. So all the various components when they become interesting. He would also like to have them dockerable in in an easy way. So that the experimentation development proceeds as we normally do here. Distribute it. But when we like it we can simply put it into on one machine. And and have it deployed somewhere for a particular purpose. So PERSON6 is the main person on on this.",
            "Cool. So the mediator as far as I know is also ready for the acquisition.",
            "Okay. Yeah, that's good. That's great to know. So, yeah. Yeah. On dissemination,. ORGANIZATION4, is there any update? So PERSON12.",
            "Hey.",
            "Yeah, or PERSON29.",
            "W. Hi. Yes. There are a few things to mention. First, we're planning the new talks and speeches for next year. Which will be likely online over time. One thing is that.",
            "You disappeared.",
            "Hello?",
            "Yeah, you disappeared for a second.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. PERSON16 maybe we can talk because some of these talks kind of private talks. The.",
            "Custom basis, as you know. As we already mentioned. So maybe we can talk again for the how we how we deal this. We are also planning public talks. But I didn't. And so now I didn't get the report form the department of.",
            "The other point is that I guess PERSON12 and PERSON13 on this report on technical -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Will really talk about this. And yeah. That's so far let's see the things about dissemination.",
            "Yeah.",
            "One thing again we also wanted to talk to our CEO again, if you remember.",
            "Yeah. I do.",
            "Maybe we can we can talk on the text couple of days this topic.",
            "Yes, please. T like propose some slots and let's find some slots and let's let's continue the discussion. That this very important.",
            "Okay.",
            "And for these private talks. The dissemination talks. It just occurred to me that actually, you should be asking us to include demos to yours talk. So whenever you have some customer who could like like it. You are doing some demos with the ORGANIZATION7 technology. But it would be better if you also had demos with with us.",
            "Yes.",
            "So t like we have.",
            "That's exactly the point we wanted to discuss with you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The last time when we t when we met with PERSON20.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We had this decision that you can provide instance about.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or no. So maybe we should talk on this -",
            "Yeah. So so this would not happen in the next until the end of the year. But we should plan that.",
            "That's no problem problem.",
            "But we should.",
            "That's that's no problem.",
            "We should plan that. And the whenever we have our systems dockerized. It would be easy for you to to like run it also indepenently. But even before that, we do these demo sessions every Monday for ourselves. So.",
            "We could do such demo session for for your talks as well.",
            "Okay. That's good. So let's let's talk. And we will send you couple of free slots.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For the upcoming days.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you.",

            "Yeah, I want our decision from you all. So, either we split the minutes, or we join the transcript. So, whatever you decide, I will do accordingly.",
            "On the contrary,, either we split the transcript or join the minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You have, you have t, you have to.",
            "No.",
            "Y.",
            "No, I said the transcripts in the ORGANIZATION2 data are splitted into various chapters right.",
            "Yes. And chapter as a separate minutes.",
            "Each chapter has separate minutes but whatever data I have now from the website, we have all the minutes in one place. Or a given day. Or a given transcript.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "OK. So, that's what I'm trying to understand that should I like,, split the minutes into separate chapters?",
            "Minutes?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Minutes are already for each separate chapter, no? So, I really - I, I, I -",
            "I think -",
            "So now I think I don't understand the question. So, as I,, as I - The minutes. It looked like each chapter has its special summary. If I'm not.",
            "Yes, yes, I know. I know. You are talking about the website, OK? Not, le-let me make it clear.",
            "Yes, maybe, maybe scr share your screen and show me what you fee, what you,,, what you mean.",
            "OK. But I guess that will be difficult. Different.",
            "I, I'm getting -",
            "I'm already. OK. OK. Let me try. Hold on.",
            "Split the minutes.",
            "Just hold on a bit, PERSON2.",
            "OK, so, can you see my screen? PERSON2?",
            "Just a moment. Yes.",
            "Wow.",
            "Yes, I can see it.",
            "So,. So, I,. So, I think, so this is how like has split it in the ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "Offering to. OK.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "So now. Let me get inside any one. OK, so,. Suppose we are talking about certain,, meeting. Suppose,, this one.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "I'm highlighting. So, this is not a good example because this is just one. OK. Suppose we are talking about this. This there.",
            "Yes. Uh-uhm.",
            "OK.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, you know like,. On a given date, so the date for this,, particular,, meeting, is 7, 7, 2011. Right.",
            "Yes. Uh-uhm.",
            "And,, this is, I guess, chapter 1. And this I guess chapter 2 and chapter 3.",
            "Yes. Uh-uhm.",
            "OK.",
            "Yes.",
            "But s. But these are all part of the same sheshn.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "But they are split into different chapters. So, what I'm asking is - Now the meeti.",
            "But these are s, these are,, transcripts.",
            "These are transcripts, just part of the same meeting.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "So, I'm asking is, like, do you want to join the transcripts of a given meeting? Do you want to do that?",
            "But within this three, three chapters, do you have several ch,,,, no. Within this three files, do you have sep several chapters or just one chapter?",
            "It's just one chapter, I guess.",
            "Are you sure? Because.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I -",
            "Transcripts,, when you open, some. So, when I open some of these transcripts, I have seen,, that the transcript included several chapters, and it was within one transcript. So, you're totally sure that all these three parts of,, July 7.",
            "Are just one chapter.",
            "No, then I have to double check because I have checked not many. So, few of them. And I, like, saw, that,, those are -",
            "Could you open a - could you open it now, so this one, two, three things.",
            "Yeah. I think I could better. I have some downloaded already.",
            "But you can just - We can just look at this one if it is already here.",
            "OK, yeah, so there are multiple -",
            "Can you see there - Yes, they're, these are multiple chapters.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "And I think, these - Open because, quite often, because,, these,, chapters are summaried according to some topic and one they included more topics. And one transcript is mo,, more or less one day. And,,,, if, if. As you can see they are just seldom separated into part one, two and three and I don't know the reason for this separation. Because otherwise,, this could be quite long transcripts also including many chapters but not separated. So, this,,, so this is what,, what I don't know, why they are actually separated, and that's why I can't even answer. So, I would be for the idea to divide one transcript for one chapter aligned with one minute for these chapter. So, I vote for that.",
            "OK.",
            "But,, if,, well, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, OK. I, I understand your point. So, you want that whatever is there in the ORGANIZATION2 data, we align the meetings,, minutes accordingly. We don't join the transcript. Right?",
            "I'm not sure that was the point. The point is - So I don't know what is in these three transcripts. That's why I can't really answer if we join or no join. It could also happen that this,, 0, 1 contains half of the chapter, I don't know, 15. And the second half of the chapter 15 is the 0, 2. I on't know.",
            "OK. Hold on, then.",
            "Let's open it. Let's - I could just try to, try to open this 1, 2, 3 and look where it,, stops and where this 0, 1 begins.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Probably -",
            "Yeah, OK. Just a second.",
            "I really, really suppose it has no reason to divide the chapters and it's quite,, un,, unprobable, je, that chapter will be splitted.",
            "Yeah, OK. Let me open this -",
            "OK, so let us look at those -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "I'm sharing my screen again. Yeah.",
            "Moment. Yes. Uh-uhm.",
            "OK, so you see th-the - This is the chapter ID 1, 11, OK?",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "The first one?",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "And then. This is just the one chapter, yeah.",
            "Try to,. Maybe search for chapter.",
            "Yeah, you see, this is chapter ID.",
            "Yes.",
            "OK. Many posted here. 0, 1, 1, 0, 1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK?",
            "Well, then, that's OK. Then it's -",
            "And then we have another chapter -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Uh-uhm. So, in this case, it's s it seems to be correspondence, all the chapters to their transcripts. To the,,, sorry, minutes.",
            "Yeah, and I guess they're all different things, so I guess. Let us keep, how it is there already.",
            "Yeah, it's different, yes. Congo and then Indonesia, yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Including attacks on minorities. Yes, it's just different. Well,. Well,. So,, in this case and still the decision,, from my,, my opinion is that each chapter should have its minutes and its transcript.",
            "Yeah, yeah, OK.",
            "I think it's just kind of intuitional decision.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Intuitive.",
            "OK, so. I'm now also calling the other years. So, I think we can,, have whatever is there in the ORGANIZATION2 data. But I think it will, like, maybe take this, like - By Monday maybe we can have the aligned things. By Monday or Tuesday, I don't know. Yes.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Bu the, but the data set would be really soon.",
            "OK, well,, fine, good to hear that.",
            "And yeah, so, I n, I needed to talk to PERSON1, but, -",
            "PERSON1 is here.",
            "She's there?",
            "Yeah, I'm there.",
            "Oh, OK. So, you got,, free today?",
            "As I said, you, you can,, just e-mail me, maybe, or do you just wanna talk, you can discuss now also.",
            "No, well maybe we have to discuss via screensharing or something,, so only when you are -",
            "Uh-uh.",
            "We can discuss.",
            "Yeah, so,, you can share your screen, maybe? Now.",
            "Now?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe not in this meeting. Maybe not in this meeting.",
            "OK.",
            "Maybe we have the, yeah. Talk separately on this. So,, how about - how about tomorrow morning for you?",
            "Tomorrow. Uh-uhm.",
            "Your screen to be shared, so maybe we can do via ORGANIZATION1 Meet.",
            "You want my screen also to be shared?",
            "Yeah, yeah, because you have already installed that, right? That interface.",
            "Yeah. Yes, I have installed,, only, the,, the annotation,, thing, the tool.",
            "Yeah, and it is working, right?",
            "Yeah, it's working.",
            "Yeah, in, in, in what happened - What is happening to my side is -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Like its working but,, some package, did you do some package called QP or something.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "It is giving - Result. OK.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "So, I need to see from you and since we need to quickly move on this so maybe we can, like, quickly discuss -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Like, how can we give it to our annotators.",
            "Uh-uhm. Yeah, so, what - what is the idea actually. I, I am, because I, I'm totally,,, new to what,, what are you thinking,, like,, what is the approach with this.",
            "Yeah, that - Yeah, that's what we have to discuss. Once, once, there,,, once we do one annotation, b, like both of us and then how would we communicate this to our annotators, that we have to think. OK.",
            "OK. Uh-uhm. So, you've already thought of the idea that,, how are these things gonna -",
            "Yeah, wh one simple thing is we s we directly give them and they give us the outputs, but.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "For that I need to personally see the output. What the - What it looks like. But in my, my end -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "I am not getting the output correctly. Because due to some -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Error or something, I don't understand.",
            "Uh-uhm. Did you - did you try that,, the same which,, which is there on the GitHub?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one. Because whatever has PERSON3 uploaded in the website, it is wrong. It pointing to some wrong,, file. So -",
            "Yeah, but the GitHub one is correct, which PERSON3 has uploaded.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So maybe you can also try to uninstall it and maybe install. It will work, I think.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I tried it, it, in Mac, in Windows. And in, Ubuntu, but.",
            "OK.",
            "There's something -",
            "OK.",
            "So, so, so, tell. Did you - Did you install it on, U-Ubuntu, or did you install it on Windows. Because, I don't know,, how, like, in which operating system the annotators are working.",
            "Annotators are mostly working on Windows.",
            "So that's why you like have to be - Make it run in Windows. And you were - So. PERSON1, it's running on Windows or in Ubuntu in your end?",
            "So, actually, I have Windows by,, default,, I have, too, Windows on my system. Sometimes I use Ubuntu, sometime I use,, it is dual booted. But then, I also use, - I have a client on Windows, which,, through which I,, actually run the all those time. So.",
            "So, it is running on Windows, right?",
            "Yeah, it is running in Windows.",
            "Wonderful, that is wonderful. So let us,, catch up maybe tomorrow, when you are a bit free from your work and -",
            "Uh-uhm, uh-uhm, yeah.",
            "Finalise it. Finalise it by tomorrow. And in tomorrow's meeting, then we can discuss this with PERSON2.",
            "Uh-uhm. So,, actually,, no, I have one thing to like,,, I - just my confusion only, I think. So,, we were able to see the output, I think. PERSON3 already made us see the output, so. Like,, what is the,,, like, what is,, going on in your mind, maybe. OK let's discuss it when we work tomorrow.",
            "No, that's, just it's, so think of it as a dryland on our end, because whatever PERSON3's showed to us -",
            "Uh-uh.",
            "And that will not. OK, we are confident about,, whatever we are giving to our annotators and whatever output we are expecting.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "And then maybe,, because,, installing the Windows, I thought,, for a non-technical person, it won't be very straight-forward.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "In Ubuntu, - In Ubuntu, it was easy.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "These things, we have to, like, communicate very clearly before giving the interface to the annotators. Let us work.",
            "OK.",
            "It's just that idea.",
            "Uh-uhm. OK. OK, so, let's meet tomorrow, maybe. So, we can maybe do that dry run.",
            "Yeah, maybe you can also point to me that web with some packages and things. Because I spend at least one or one and half hours on that but I still could not figure it out.",
            "OK, OK. So, did you write to PERSON3? About that?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wri I wrote to PERSON3 and yeah,, so, and expecting his replay. But, since,, on your end it is already running, so there's -",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So maybe,, to see if,,, because I'm not,, because I'm not,, spend much time on that, so, yeah, I think it is something which you want. So, maybe just,, have a look at it,, and maybe,, we'll discuss, what exactly,, the idea you want to be communicated to annotators.",
            "Yeah, I think, I think I want to see what output the interface is giving.",
            "Uh-uhm. OK.",
            "And what many people think that they got off that. So, once I have that.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Then we can move forward, OK?",
            "Uh-uhm. OK.",
            "OK,. Yeah. So, PERSON2, anything else?",
            "No, well I'm really looking forward, that,, you make it work this alignment. That we can start with the annotators.",
            "Oh, yeah, the interface, you mean, right?",
            "Yes. Well, just all the communication. With annotators.",
            "Yes. Yes, yes.",
            "Eagerly waiting for the result.",
            "We will resolve it, don't worry.",
            "I will send you the - I will send you, your, the meetings. Now, so the,, the minutes for evaluation. A so,, I will send you the e-mail with, a, the minutes. Ask for evaluation and,,, when we can discuss it. At the end of next week, I suppose, probably,,. Is it enough to have a week, for,, you to, for the manual evaluation?",
            "So, how many minutes I have to evaluate?",
            "5.",
            "5 minutes?",
            "Maybe 6. Yes.",
            "Wow.",
            "Each of us?",
            "No, just, you will get,, 5 or 6,, minutes. One of them is yours. And,. You will look at them, compare, think about,, different measurements, how,, so, you, and, yeah,, evaluate, so just,. Evaluate these meetin mee minutes for the same meeting. All of them are for the same meeting.",
            "Is the evaluation based on the overleaf, right? Based on whatever is there on overleaf.",
            "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
            "No, based on your,, based on your evalu all of your possible evaluating properties.",
            "OK.",
            "It can include - You can, do, you can also use automatic - If you have, but,, you can use,, this overleaf document and overleaf techniques, but first of all, use your mind. So really think about problems that arise while evaluating,. So,, think,, think of -, think of it as much as you can and write down the problems, so just really, to, get,, the,,, discussion. So, d.",
            "Yeah, so. So, so let me quickly point,, like, just,, while doing the annotation, my quick thoughts on this is number 1, the task is super tough, even for humans, and s, the meetings that we have are super unstructured.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "So. Yeah. Now, when I did the minutes,, and when I saw them, after creating the minutes, I really thought that these minutes are actually the action points, what came out from that. Yeah.",
            "Your minutes.",
            "Yeah, right. My minutes are actually the action points that needs to be done after the meeting is over.",
            "Well, this is your output. You will,, see also the outputs of the others and,.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Then you also can see -",
            "I need to talk about that, why, why doing the minuting, so this what i thought,, like, what came out from my end.",
            "Yeah, and this is what we want to discuss, so this is, so d. You are now already starting to discuss, what I want to make,, kind of general discussion, say, in a week.",
            "Yeah, OK. OK, So.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "You, PERSON2, you were saying -",
            "No, write down these things.",
            "Yeah, you have to evaluate five minutes. So, PERSON2, so please give us a one week time, so let us discuss -",
            "Yes, yes. till next Friday, say. Yes.",
            "Yeah, Friday, yeah, wonderful.",
            "Till next Friday, I will send you the minutes, and,, the plan, for,, the, for the evaluation, for the next Friday, and -",
            "And we complete the evaluation by maybe Thursday and on Friday and we discuss all of us. Like we have a longer meeting to discuss -",
            "Yes.",
            "What we found out. Yeah. OK.",
            "So,, I have one question. Each of us is gonna,, do the evaluation for say 5 or 6 minutes? PERSON2?",
            "Yes.",
            "Each of us? Or, or,.",
            "Yes. Yes. Each of us.",
            "One of us. OK.",
            "No, each of us.",
            "Uh-uhm, OK, OK.",
            "It's more interesting, so everybody has some,, s-some,, so some decisions, some thoughts about that, some idears.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, each of us should look at everybody's minutes and -",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "And their own judgements.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "And PERSON2, please,, rename the minutes according,, accordingly, so,. Like,, for a given minute, it is evaluated by 3 of us or 4 of us. We can easily identify of which minutes we are talking about.",
            "OK. Uh-uhm. OK, I will, I will name it somehow.",
            "Uh-uhm.",
            "Uh-uhm. Yes. They -",
            "Wonderful.",
            "Uh-uhm. Thank you. Well, OK. Then, this is all from -",
            "Yeah. So yeah, now like - Next week, then after next week, we have to really be focused on the proposal and the shared task that, OK, by the next week I think the ORGANIZATION2 data would be ready to us, for us. And,, and we need to really, like now, segregate what are the data that would be available to us from our meetings, because some of them we have to discard, right? PERSON2? And that exact data statistic should go inside the proposal.",
            "I didn't get thi. Sorry for that, I didn't understand you, because my children are quarrelling.",
            "OK.",
            "They are, they are playing cards and they,, they are very unhappy with each other, I'm sorry.",
            "And you were, like, discussing so boring things with us, so, I understand.",
            "They don't understand it - They don't speak English, but -",
            "So what did you ask -",

            "In two weeks I think it would be very,, very early for you, I don't know. But,, let's say,, we need to have the data with us, by No by November 15th.",

            "Oh.",
            "So just to make sure, you. Yeah, so we can extend it maybe to 20 or 21? But. The data, the evaluation matrix, all these things should be,, at least 70 percent clear to us before we submit the proposal. Because it can eventually change,, while we upload the shared task, but. Majority of the, of the things should be ready.",
            "Yeah, yeah, well, I understand it and I really know that I should do that. This is kind of a big piece of work I should do. That I should go through all the meetings and look at the perp - the people who are all inside there, but this,, so, this is realistic, but I have,, I really don't want to do that. So, I don't start. So, I s, I know that I - Do that but,, I kind of have no,, emotional - But I will do that. No, no - So, I have no choice.",

It's too far to here. So, I have to - tomorrow morning I'll be travelling. We can have the meeting,, maybe, after-afternoon, if, if, if that suits you well.",

But,, our evaluation should be really manual in all senses. So,, we are supposed to read very carefully the transcript. And if you like, I can also send you the audio files. And read the minutes. And esti. So we can use the document with the manual evaluation, which everyone and PERSON1 prepared. But our task is to evaluate it from all possible ways we are able to evaluate. So,, is. This is not just give the numbers but to really think about this evaluation. So to you think about if,, maybe possibly we need some other scale, some other estimation. So re. So if we have. So su. Important is,, not to get the number, but to write down, to fix, to understand what,, problems we explored when evaluating. Yes?",

You read,, the transcript or listen to the recording, and evaluate the minutes from all possible ways you are able to evaluate it. And write down all your comments to that. Not just give the number from one to five. But you, you personally, especially you really think about what is,, possible to evaluate. What is not poss. So really think about it. Go deep into the idea of evaluation.",
            "Why would I do that?",
            "Ask PERSON3. Because it was discussed many times already. Really think about evaluation the minutes from all possible ways. Why you do that? Because,, the task. The. So, We want all,, all of all of our team should know what does it really mean,, to evaluate the minute.",
            "Yes, but for this PERSON3 said we should do one or two samples.",

            "Integrate the similarity measure into the alignment tool?",
            "Yeah, so, yeah so because. Because,, because we have the minutes and the original meeting and how similar they are, so it will also be a score there. Sim. About the semantic similarity of it.",
            "I. How.",
            "So I don't know whether it can.",
            "So, just, just just I didn't I didn't get it. The similarity between what and what.",
            "Between the,, meeting and the minutes.",
            "Meeting you mean transcript.",
            "Yes. The transcript and the minutes and two different minutes as well.",
            "Yeah, but how to integrate it,, into the alignment tool. So, you mean.",
            "Yeah. I have to look at it.",
            "So just there is. So you as the annotator open the tool. You see on the left side the transcript. On the right side the minutes and what is this measure for. Or how -. Where do you see it. So what, what.",
            "Yeah, so as I as we already discussed that,, we will be integrating the manual evaluation with the annotation tool for the annotators,, to give the scores. Based on our manual evaluation aspects. So can,, the semantic similarity,, can also integrated to it. I just have to look at it.",
            "Yes, aha.",
            "I just had that idea in my mind. I have to look at the practical aspect. I,, I actually I'm right now working on PERSON2's alignment tool. I was,, running it and I was seeing how can we could integrate. Because understanding someone else code is is difficult for me. So I was trying to understand this code.",
            "Yes, It is always so.",
            "Yeah. So I was trying to understand figure it out, where can I put. And which code is for what. So I was trying to understand it.",
            "Yes. Well. But. I will just repeat,,, the essence if got it.",
            "We use. We integrate your,, similarity measure not during the annotation of the alignment. This is task one and this is something individual from the evaluation. And so we do,, this,, alignment between the transcript and the minutes. This is the task one and this doesn't concern the measure. And then you propose to evaluate. To to use,, the similarity measure when evaluating, yes?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "This is. I totally agree with that. Of course it is good to integrate. Yes. Thank you. It's a very good idea.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hello PERSON1.",
            "So I have. So my model is training for two days. And I think I will show you that model which I've made. Yeah, I think I need to look at.",
            "PERSON1, PERSON1 I just want to understand.",
            "Yes, yes, yeah.",
            "I just want to understand that,. You said it's a big model like it's a big model.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So do you think you can integrate that big model into a very normal interface would be straight forward?",
            "Oh, well, we can, we can do that easily. We can, we can,,, integrate,,, saved model and we can integrate that. That's not a problem.",
            "Okay. So you want to train that model and then that we will involve that model for the testing. Right?",
            "No, no.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I think we do have,,,, way out. That we can save any model which you have trained into an interface by making it as a FAU? Like, like a pickled file or like a .hf file or any file will just give you an output.",
            "Yeah, yeah I understand. So you want to save the trained model and integrate.",
            "Yes, yes, you got me correct, yes. So only the score will be calculated for the semantic similarity of documents and of the transcript and the minutes. So actually the key idea was to make everything together. Like,, all the evaluation, all the,, semantic sense. So because this is actually all evaluation part, the manual, automatic and the semantic similarity, they are all evaluation. Like all the parts of evaluation. So the key idea is to integrate all the evaluation thing into one place. And not to segregate them, so we have something to demonstrate.",
            "So what is metric, what is the metric for the semantic similarity?",
            "It is based on the Botch model but then GPT is also involved into it. The model.",
            "GPT what, two or three?",
            "Two.",
            "Okay, and then the metric metric is what kind of similarity? Can you like. Maybe if you,, have that. Can you demonstrate that? Like what what it looks like? Or how it actually.",
            "Definitely, definitely I will when I'm in the stage to. But I was just discussing the idea that we can integrate it with,, this same annotation tool that is the only proper site now to have this conversation, so.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hello.",
            "Hi, hi.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. What else An PERSON5?",
            "You wanted to. We wanted to discuss something yesterday. I don't know what it was. You and me.",
            "It was about the, yeah, yeah, it was about the synchronisation of that.",
            "Aha. Yes, yes, and work with annotators. Yes?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Are you ready to discuss it with me? Do you have it prepared so that I can learn how to use it and give it to annotators?",
            "No, not yet.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm still in the development thing. Let me, let me finish it first.",
            "Okay. Yes, yes I agree. I just asked. We will do it next time.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure.",
            "Then I don't have anything else. I'll send you the file.",
            "It, it should be straight forward.",
            "Yes, it should but I don't know how. I have. At the moment I have no instructions.",
            "Oh, PERSON5?",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON5 we discussed yesterday that,, anyhow we don't need synchronisation now because we decided that someone will be there. That. Who will be the,, moderator between the annotators and the GitHub. So, do we need synchronisation?",
            "Yeah, that's what I mean by synchronisation.",
            "That's different. That's something different. Synchronisation is the annotation within the PERSON2's tool,, the synchronisation between the transcripts and minutes. And this is needed.",
            "It is. Yeah.",
            "Synchronisation between transcripts and minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "It is not done yet?",
            "No.",
            "Oh, okay. That's what PERSON2 was,, talking about that day.",
            "I I didn't understand.",
            "Yeah. You didn't understand now? Or you didn't understand that?",
            "I didn't understand. No, what is this?",
            "Okay, so.",
            "So what is.",
            "What we need to do is to give our annotators the task to synchronise transcripts and minutes wit, using PERSON2's tool. And this is not done.",
            "Synchronise means alignment, like -.",
            "Yes. Let's to. I I always use the word alignment and then you say synchronisation so this is actually.",
            "No, no, no, no. You know I meant by synchronisation means I meant that how synchronising the process. Like how yuo would give it to the annotators, how they use it and how deliver the work of that. It is interpreted.",
            "Aha, now I get it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we need to do alignment.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "And before that. Before doing alignment we should,,, speak about synchronisation. Okay. Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is.",
            "I guess al, alignment is already there in the tool. We need to like train the annotators how to do that.",
            "Yes, we should, yes, Train the annotators. Give them the task. So this is what I don't know how to do.",
            "Yeah,, so that maybe, like. Let us do it early early next week. Maybe early next week we can have like the the method how we would communicate with the annotators. And how they would revert back to us, okay? And then you can like call your annotators and we can give give them demonstration,, how they should do it.",
            "Yes it's it's not a bad idea. Yes, so we can do a common call on how to do that.",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "So I I can try. It's not so easy actually I've never heard them and they are very sporadic. So, everybody is working in their own,,. I don't know when they are working and if they are able divulge some concrete time for that. But I will try to.",
            "Yeah. I think we can do multiple sessions because it won't take much time.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right?",
            "Yes, it won't take much time.",
            "Yeah. So what we can do is, we can we can yeah we can float a to meet link. And ask them their,, schedule and based on that we can do that.",
            "Yes, yes very good idea. Okay, so let's let's finish for today. Yeah?",
            "I don't have much else. Oh, okay. So next two days I can't be there in the coffee call because I have conference to present my research so.",
            "Yeah, so next two days.",
            "And PERSON4 is it possible somehow that i can record the meeting so because otherwise.",
            "Oh, I am not at the call. I can't actually do that. Maybe if you cold do me. If you could give me the,, I don't know,,, the password and the e-mail to ORGANIZATION2? I can, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, or or else what you can do PERSON5 is you can schedule a new ORGANIZATION2 meet. Like.",
            "Well but it means that.",
            "For the two days.",
            "It means that I make another link and then we are all lost in all this.",
            "No, no, just for two days. Like. It should be easy.",
            "How to do that. Okay, I will, I will, I will.",
            "But the other thing that I can do is, just, I can start the meeting and I leave.",
            "Okay, this is also possible.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like.",
            "I actually don't know. Should maybe. Maybe we should cancel these two meetings for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Because should should. If we. I don't. If PERSON6 doesn't have anything serious to discuss with us, do you?",
            "Then like we can.",
            "What about PERSON3. Is it possible to have PERSON3 in one of these meetings?",
            "Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow?",
            "I don't know. One of these days.",
            "Yes, it is possible. It it. So, normally it is. It works so, that if I want, if we want, if we want to have him in the meeting I ask him and he asks what we want to discuss and when I say what we want to discuss, he joins. What I, what are we going to discuss.",
            "About these things. I mean. I see there is a little bit of confusion on what we are saying so maybe he can join and clarify a little bit the tasks that we are working on.",
            "But you mean this evaluation.",
            "Yes.",
            "Or something else. Or or some other things.",
            "Around the evaluation, the thing that we are building like this tool that we are building.",
            "So about.",
            "He should be, he should be part of the discussion I mean.",
            "Yes, yes, I agree I totally agree. But on the other hand if PERSON4 cannot be present tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, it it maybe possibly a loss of information, to ask PERSON3 to come and to let him describe everything without PERSON4.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So we would rather ask him to join next week and discuss -.",
            "I think, I think PERSON5 this is a good plan, because,, I think by the next week if PERSON3 joins I can like also maybe show him the ORGANIZATION1 corpus from our end.",
            "I think that that may be done. I'm not, I'm still not sure.",
            "Okay.",
            "And maybe by that time.",
            "So I'll ask him to join next week,.",
            "Yeah, maybe by that time PERSON1 can also come up with that bit she is saying. So we will have completed updates and bits to show him. And it would be better that he like comments how to like go forward.",
            "Okay.",
            "We would be much better prepared to talk to him I think.",
            "Okay, okay. We will schedule it,, with him like next week. Fine then,.",
            "Like but but if if PERSON6 has to discuss anything urgent then I think then we can.",
            "No, no I have nothing urgent, I I have nothing urgent but I mean that the things we discuss. There is like a confusion or there is unclarity on what to do, how to do it and I think PERSON3 is important that PERSON3 takes part, just fifteen minutes of I mean. So it's good that PERSON3 is.",
            "But PERSON6 maybe there.",
            "Takes part in this discussion.",
            "PERSON6 I think there is a little bit, I think there could be a misunderstanding of what you consider to be a confusion. Could you write it down to the agenda for example. So, because I don't know what do you think to be a confusion. And,, maybe I have some,, connotations with confusion so I can suppose something that shouldn't be that one that should be. What you mean by confusion. Could you write it down?",
            "I was also thinking the same. Because we know what we are working on and we are doing that.",
            "Okay okay. I mean.",
            "So maybe PERSON6.",
            "PERSON3 should be aware of what we are discussing. This is I mean to to to clarify things.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, PERSON6 he actually.",
            "He needs to know about what we are doing. Because maybe what we are doing is not really what we need. So he is the project manager, he has to be aware of the things.",
            "But maybe.",
            "He is.",
            "Could you, could you PERSON6 please write down four bullet points of what you are not sure about. Because it is really important.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's really important that you are not confused.",
            "I'm not clear about what you're saying in the evaluation phase. I mean we're saying a lot of different things about the evaluation and I see a lot of redundancy or a lot o. I mean for example you are saying that we have. You said that we have to like write to explain all the difficulties or something like that.",
            "Yes, this is what PERSON3 said. This is, many times and he also said he said that he also told that to you. So this is his very very strong idea, we spoke longer than an hour yesterday on that topic. That he wants all of you really to go through the transcript to go deep into the transcript.",
            "Yes.",
            "And,, analyse the meetings and look at,,, analyse the minutes look at the minutes and evaluate them from your point of view. Right all of it down and come up with something what is good and what is bad. And discuss it. This is just. This is what I am saying I am just transferring my yesterday's talk with PERSON3.",
            "So, yeah, PERSON5 I I got this. I got your message.",
            "This is my point. PERSON5 this is the point. This is who I am saying. This is what I am saying. PERSON3 has to say it explicitly it to all of us in such meetings. Not just to tell it to you or me and then we we tell to to each other.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. Fine.",
            "It creates a lot of misunderstanding. A lot of misinterpretation you know of the of the verbage, of the wording.",
            "Okay, I got it, I got it.",
            "This is what I was saying. That PERSON3 should say it life to all of us so that there is, so that there is not a you know,, like a misinterpretation of the the of the the wording of of.",
            "Yes.",
            "The from from him to us, or from him to me and to us. This is what I am saying that it's important that he spends ten minutes of in one day to take part in this discussions rather than than delivering his message to the two of us and then we explain to the others. So this is what I'm saying. That it is better to have hime here for ten minutes not more because he is busy and have. To be more clear with each other. This is. I don't have anything specific, but I'm saying it's better to proceed like this. Because to avoid misunderstandings.",
            "Okay. I got it.",
            "I will ask PERSON3 to present this idea to us once more. Okay.",
            "Yes. And also possibly take part in these things, just ten minutes a day. We don't have to make this call at two, we can adjust it based on his availability.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, well, I'm not sure really if if he will be able. So this second thing I'm not sure. He will definitely.",
            "Yes, I'm also not sure, yes.",
            "Okay, but, I I got the idea. So.",
            "So,, the thing is PERSON5 for what PERSON3 said as I learned from you and I am completely in sync what you said.",
            "So, what I understand stood from PERSON3 it's,, the idea is that we don't want to do a formal evaluation measure that we have listed, like PERSON1 and PERSON6 have listed. We just want our perspective of what we think about the minutes. In a, in a and then maybe from our summarisation, like what we find out, then we can like translate them into some formal measures. That are already there.",
            "Also.",
            "So.",
            "Also, so it's kind of independence, an independent tasks in some sense.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, of course creating automatic as well as manual evaluation measures is very very important. For the shared task and for our task in the PROJECT1 as well. But, to be able to prepare all these measures, especially you as programmers, as or persons who are working with different automatic tools, he wants us, all of us, to be kind of inside the program. To understand how the meeting looks like, how the minutes look like. How the annotators create the minutes from the transcript, so he wants us, and especially you, to see with our own eyes,,, the real minutes from the meeting. So that evaluations are based,, evaluation measures as well as results, are based on some reasonable thinking. Because this is a very very new task. But not just on existing automatic measures that are on the market.",
            "Yeah, I I do totally agree to that. That is actually the correct way to do it. What PERSON3 said, than taking some,, measures and evaluating it. But we can come up with new good ideas, I think by doing that way.",
            "Yes, yes that's why, that's why this dry run.",
            "Yeahm.",
            "Did you get it, PERSON4? PERSON4?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "I can't hear you. Technical problem. I don't know, you are on a kind of.",
            "I can't hear you. Maybe my internet connection, but.",
            "No, it's for me as well. It is a shaky voice.",
            "Now he is. PERSON4 is lost. You're lost. We don't hear.",
            "Right, can can you hear me?",
            "Right. Yes, now we can.",
            "I wanted that. So PERSON5 if you can,, send the dry run details,, soon. So that we can come up with our observations by Monday. In the Monday meeting, so we have something to.",
            "Yeah, so I will summarise it as follows. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we are not going to have any meetings. But, today, late today or early tomorrow I will send you,, the transcript. I will send you the minutes to that transcript and some instruction what can I. So what can I se, se, kind of summarise to that topic. What PERSON3 and me want from all of us. And,.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's all for today.",
            "Yeah, yeah I think it's over from my side.",
            "Yeah, and from my side too. So see you on Monday, yeah?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Have a wonderful weekend.",
            "And you too. For you too. Okay. Bye.",
            "Thank you. Bye, bye.",

            "Yeah, okay, thank you. So,, yeah okay, okay so that - I saw a message from from the meeting. As probably already notified all of you that you are beeing recorded now. And you can simply to refrain from speeking if you don't want to be recorded. You yourself and - and don't don't share anything. I'll go over the agenda, which I. Because of the like mix devices that I'm using which I cannot directly share with you. I can only do highlighting in the ORGANIZATION7 document. So if you're looking at the agenda in this ORGANIZATION7 document. You will see me selecting the first point and the Grand agreement. Yesterday it was signed by the ORGANIZATION5. And now it needs to be signed by all the partners. So your representative prersons for our case. Is the the - the legal signatory person has to to research. Click the match project and then click the Grand agreement. It seems like the pdf icon but it's not the download pdf. It unrolls small part of that of that list. And there will be button to sign it. So I think that everybody will be able to do this in the coming days or. You can do it right now. And if you have any technical problem with finding the button please contact me. So that we can like explain how to do this. So as you also know the Grand agreement already includes our project proposal, all the things that we promise to do. So that that now going to be like thirty-five. And the you're being commissionised approved our goals. So the next item is the concertion agreement and I would like to agree on the final wording. It will not happen on the call as I mentioned but it should hopefully happen for example by the end of the week or or so.",
            "The project I also proceeding this this fast. We got set of suggestions from ORGANIZATION6. That PERSON12 has entered to the ORGANIZATION7 document because we receive them in in Word ducument. And - So if you see some comments from PERSON12 then most of them are actually by ORGANIZATION6 lawyers. And I went through all of them and I don't think there is anything bad, It's mainly like minor wording issues. So our plan is to accept all of those. Except the one which was softening the Grand agreement Grand agreement requirements to notify everyone ahead of publication. So if you're a member s if you have. I could - Can someone. PERSON9, can you - can you make me a presenter one of the PERSON11s. Okay.",
            "Which one.",
            "One of you, the one that is speaking is a presenter.",
            "Okay, so, can I still be speaking from the same device but be a presenter from the laptop?",
            "Maybe, if you switch to the native client and not the web one then I don't know which one it is.",
            "Let me just - try see when it's the right one.",
            "I'm speaking so -",
            "Sorry, someone was very quiet, who was that?",
            "I've heard someone speaking, was that.",
            "Turning up.",
            "Yeah, PERSON12 okay. this one yeah.",
            "Okay, wrong one.",
            "That's wrong, yeah that's wrong PERSON11. And PERSON12 your - your voice is very okay - So switch to the. I can speak on the - on the other connection in the meantime. So in the - the Grand. So does everybody know which paragraph I was referring to? Not the Grand agreement requirement. Yeah, well, I haven't heard.",
            "Yeah, page twenty-six.",
            "Eleven point nine I think.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "I'm not quite sure where we are in this cause all of the crossings and so on so -",
            "Yeah, so now the text - now the text seems crossed out.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we would like to reject this suggestion to delete it so we would like to keep that in.",
            "Okay.",
            "It is the text which - which comes originally from our lawyer Yeah. who suggested to remove it again. It was never in the part of - it was never in the template, so we added it and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we would still like to keep it.",
            "So sorry, I apologize for not having read all of the lawyers comments. But what did he propose instead?",
            "Nothing, just to.",
            "Nothing. Okay, so then, there will be no obligations of dissemination. Is that right?",
            "The Grand agreement has a rule which requires Aha. everybody to to - Yeah, I - I'll - I - You already see my screen, so I'll try to minimalise this and I'll scroll to that point. So that you are hopefully now seeing the right thing. And certain number. And this excercise. Was it - was it 9 something?",
            "Eleven point nine.",
            "Eleventh point, yes, eleventh point I think, so - Twenty-six, eleven point nine, yes.,. So text, it's what has been proposed by our lawyer and it's - It's PERSON12 wanted to remove that but it was your lawyer who wanted to remove that.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I will try to -",
            "So whatever I'm I'm I'm confused what our lawyer wants it to go back to the Grand agreement where we have to specify these fourty-five days, which nobody ever does anyway.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Okay. And - results cover. I can quite read it, this is crossed.",
            "Okay. So I'll reject it at the moment.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I just limited it.",
            "I mean I think these restrictions in a publication just impact no way, that's the same. Nobody ever follows them anyway.",
            "Yeah. So if you are fine with not following your lawyer's recommendation Yeah. then we're there.",
            "Yeah. I'm not sure whether we understand this but, yeah. I mean he's basically saying don't publish somebody else's results or something like that.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah. This is what you did the last time and if you think that someone would like to it, also like don't do it, don't publish it, because publishing is what prevents it from.",
            "Right, so somebody was a the obligation is on them to say it to all members, look, don't publish anything, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Right.",
            "Yea yea yea kind of. Somebody wants to that they should say so to the to the colleagues of the. I hope that - like it - The wording is. I think the wording is soft, which otherwise the protection of - Can be listening without our notice, so arrangement, the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yea, yea yea, so, so the first, this is -",
            "I don't know, yeah, I mean I. This was - probably have to. I suppose, I don't more than I do. Do we - Are we bound by what the lawyer says, or can we just -",
            "I don't know I think we'll have to double check both and I would also personally agree that this - clause is fine and we can push back on what the lawyer says.",
            "Right.",
            "Yeah, I don't know how in ORGANIZATION6, double check with your lawyers, but I think that our lawyers are not signing it anyway. And this is - it's actually the signing it. But you are in the end, so I think that you can follow or ignore their recommendations.",
            "Right, right.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, we'll check who has to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Who has to make the decision, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so, yeah, so I think that's hopefully clear so you have the extra days that - Or how much you need - That will also have. So. Okay, so here the resolution is - So PERSON5 will double check with their lawyers the paragraph can probably stay in CA despite ORGANIZATION6's lawyers' recommendation. And another, like a bigger change that was there was that your lawyer suggested option one instead of option two which we have preselected in this joint ownership. So let's look at that, 8.2, option one, yeah. So joint ownership unless otherwise agreed - Each of the joint owner should be entitled to use their jointly owned results for non-commercial research activities on a royalty-free basis without prior content. And should be entitled to otherwise exploit and to grant non-exclusive licences to third parties. If the other joint owners are given notice and reasonable conditions. So, I've checked this and this is the exact wording which appears in the original desktop template and we have originally drop it because it was like too verbose for us and no particular reason, and your lawyer suggested that they would rather use this option one. So we are fine with that as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "So if everyone is fine with that then ORGANIZATION4 will accept this reccomendation and use option one, not option two.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so that's the other big point. And all the other edits seems free to review them in the document but all of them semms very minor to me and like - I haven't seen any implications that would arise some accepting or reducing themselves. We'll just accept that. Yeah. So there is, yeah, there is then the completion of signature pages so I would like to ask PERSON12 and every partner to check the final - This is at the end of the document, it is just before the attachements come. There should be one page per partner with just the signatures and that right persons mentioned. So, it's, ten, eleven,... signatures, yeah. As witness the parties have caused and insert name of a party so everybody in the order as listed at the top of the document. Please insert your correct names and people who are signing it ant the titles other know about the date maybe the date we will - we entered only like nand Friday. So PERSON12 will probably prepare this, or you can do it on your own and make sure to validate it we have the right person mentioned there. So that here is no problem with - with the name. So let - that signature pages and then there is the background, So I would like to thank everbody for providing their background information. And I would like to ask everyone now to check every other's background. So the idea is that whatever is listed in the background will be freely available for the project purposes. So think of your obligations in the project so what you are expected to deliver and what you - So ORGANIZATION1 is going to integrate everything, so ORGANIZATION1 will have to expect - Will have to get the translation systems and moduls and all this from the other parties. In some cases this is - this will be new results, think that we will be developing the project and that holds for them automatically. But for something it is existing moduls and these existing moduls need to be mentioned in the background that the party is providing. Otherwise we would need to like add the background later. So it is obviously something that we can like resolve later, if we forget something it can be inviting correctly at any point, but if we do it now it will be easier. So everybody please check that all other parties are providing what you will need for your work, for your obligations. Some parties, such as us, we mention more things and that's okay as well. So that's not a problem. But it's important that everybody sees that they are getting the tools and resources for their duties in the project. So if you have any problem, if you have anything missing, please contact the respective party and - and also copy me and or PERSON12 and like we should negotiate. So the I would deadline, deadline end of the week. So by the end of the week please double check that you have - that you are getting the resources that - that you will need. Okay. So the next point is then - So we have discussed that the ORGANIZATION8 office, whether they would be able to sign the the concertion agreement as it is, We have even translated it to OTHER6 for them so that they could review it. And unfortunately the final word is that that they will not be signing this as a partners, The main reason is that it's run up the OTHER5 law and that would be difficult for them to explain to their lawyers that this is not no harm to them. So, I don't expect that the whole concertion would be happy to switch to to the OTHER6 law, We've discussed this already, And, so instead of of making ORGANIZATION8 sign this agreement we will be having the lateral agreement, So ORGANIZATION8 will indeed like a third party. Formally it's us who is promising that the respective things will be available for the project and - and delivered to the - to the project and so on, And we will have this linguist linguist with the PROJECT1. But we also need the ORGANIZATION8 to be able to use the results from the project, So the voice, this is done, that the ORGANIZATION8 will be listed among the affiliated entities. And there is an attachement prepared for this already entered as the suggestion ORGANIZATION8 for that, So ORGANIZATION8 is not signing but it appears in at in the attachement number four, And that's that's it. So, I don't think that there is any problem for any other partner with this, It's our risk. And if ORGANIZATION8 misbehaves then we will simply find another user and find another circumstances to test our tools and so on. But this is like the worst case scenario nad I don't expect it to happen at all. Yeah, so, in the link in the formal agreement that we will have with the ORGANIZATION8, We will make sure that the ORGANIZATION8 will provide data for trading and testing whatever can be provided and this is of course - this cannot be listed at the moment even because no one knows how much data is there and so on. So it can be made - It cannot be made more precise this specification. Yeah. And,, also that the project will get access and - and the option to test the tools at LOCATION3 events, especially the ORGANIZATION2 Congress. And we will also like, again very closely follow the description of action or the description of work, to make sure that - Because ORGANIZATION8 is listed there, actually, So there are some tasks where ORGANIZATION8 has some person located, And they are part of some deliver in some way, so we'll make sure that this is this appears in the link between ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION8 in some way. Okay, so are there any further comments for the concertion agreement?",
            "Maybe technical one Yeah., well, you say that ORGANIZATION8 will provide the access to the Congress and in the hypothetical situation you should replace us, then it will be very hard to find a replacement that will allow you to that condition then. That's the technical one.",
            "Yeah, yea, yea, yea, that's our risk. Well, this cannot happen. So you are running the Congress, we will get it. Well if it does happen we will find another conference, there's there's also like conferences on the field in the worst case that, there is conferences around, But let's hope not happen.",
            "Yeah, of course.",
            "Yeah, okay. So let me just double check whether will join the call or not. This - I do not see - No - So it doesn't seem that - that the call. It's not too big problem anyway, because they don't have their word from their lawyers. So we will treat two calls separately, Hopefully nothing will - nothing serious will come from their lawyer anymore. And hopefully by the end of the week, the concertion agreement will be in the state which will be like finalised. So that we will then circulate it among you so that you can review it for the last time and it should be ready for signing from the next week. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so then there is this Doodle for the meeting. We should like to have it like one and half days probably in - in LOCATION2, So please indicate your availability for that - for that Doodle poll and we will then, again by the end of the week, try to decide on the date. As I wrote in the email today the project officer would also like to join and - So I told him to - to - fill that poll as well, And I would like surely ORGANIZATION8 to - to be there, And since it's in LOCATION2 it should be easy for them, So PERSON9, also ORGANIZATION3 should - should indicate his availability. At least PERSON1, maybe other people, because there is also like the dissemination activity that we have planned, So there could be other people, It's still like lot of time ahead but there wou there would be the - the try run workshops, So whoever is involved from ORGANIZATION8, it would probably be nice to - to attend that event.",
            "Yeah, I agree.",
            "Yeah. And for other partners, it is - So normally it's like the representative of - of the key research people who are attending this - this meeting, The interview meetings and the meeting, But I think it could - it would be very useful also especially for the less experienced partners if their administrative people joined this, So please consider that, It is your money, your - your travel fond that you have to use this, So you - you will not get much from us, You will get some dinner but not - not the accomodation for example, And so - But there should be enough in your budget to - to cover as many people as - as you find appropriate. So - so, when we will have selected the date you will see how many pople from your team make it and then we will plan like numbers and - and see like how to - how to organise it, But as I said, main message is that we would like to meet also your administrative people. It - it's probably not necessary for big universities like ORGANIZATION6 where the administrative people have like thousands of projects per year. Okay, so that, and yeah, I'm - I'm - yeah, Let's look poll later. And then there is the one more thing, Or there is more thigs. The try run, the very first try run that I have emailed ORGANIZATION1 and ORGANIZATION6 about some while ago, I haven't heard from you and I take it as a - as a like - polite way of saying no, But I would still like to convince you to - to say yes to this. It's called - In OTHER6 it's - it's the it's the congress or fair of non-existing companies, The OTHER4 name is - is slightly different, It is high school students who are coming to - to this event, And they are presenting some fake companies and everybody like follows and they - There - there is some competitions about the presentation of these companies and there is a one more competition, The one like ninety seconds in - in an elevator presentation of the company. The presentations are run in OTHER6 or OTHER4, It depends on the - on the team, And PERSON12 has talked to the high school teacher who is organising this and he was fine with us joining this event, The only catch is that it's already on March twenty - twenty-second. And, as I've seen the - the workshop that - ORGANIZATION8 has - had two weeks ago, I think it would be very useful for us to see that the life conditions of - of some congress. So I think it's a very good opportunity to test it and I've also seen the - the demos that ORGANIZATION1 and had for the technology from the previous project the ORGANIZATION. And I think the - the demos were exceptional. It was very good, so, I would really like to see some similar set-up tested in practice, Because like that's a harsh with high school students and their bad OTHER4 pronunciation and OTHER6 which we don't have modul form and so no. So, yeah. So - so our - our invitation is in these to go for this and and - and run it as a good as wee can, and I would like you to - to take part. So I'm not requiring asking anyone to attend LOCATION2 in person unless you would like to, But I would like to ask for your assistance with the existing moduls and tools, So that we could test it with - with the PROJECT2 tools, and not some like - some other solution that there is - there is ways how we could replace various components from PROJECT2 with other tools, But I would like to go as close from the technical point of view, as we'll be delivering for the ORGANIZATION8 in the coming years.",
            "So from the IT side we can do the - the ORGANIZATION1 would be seems the proper clause in any way can be.",
            "I'm sorry, it's very hard for me to understand, I try to switch off my - So I'm now - Yeah.",
            "I understood the question so, PERSON1, I confirm that we can use the Explore protocol and the protocol you're - you already have used in the past project, And the mediator is so, yeah, available for testing even immediately.",
            "Yes it should be to the, Which language.",
            "I haven't - I didn't understand PERSON1.",
            "My question was which language directions we might have.",
            "Yes, so it would be only OTHER4 to OTHER6 and OTHER6 to OTHER4, but we don't have OTHER6, so - We'll se, whatever is -",
            "I can do OTHER4 to something? And OTHER3 to something? But currently the OTHER6.",
            "So the trade of ficticious companies - It's organised in LOCATION2 and ficticious companies from economics high schools from all over the LOCATION3 will come to LOCATION2, but the main communication language will be OTHER4, So mainly it will be from OTHER4 to OTHER6 and since there will be also a lot of companies from the LOCATION4, so - Also from OTHER6 to OTHER4. PERSON1 Are there going to be OTHER3 companies for example? Or OTHER3 high school students?",
            "There should be, they -",
            "So we could for example do OTHER4 to OTHER3, OTHER4 we can also do OTHER4 to OTHER2, OTHER3 to OTHER2, OTHER4 to OTHER1 for example, OTHER3 to OTHER1 ….",
            "They still don't know how many companies will come, because they opened the registration like two weeks ago, so they still don't have too many companies signed in.",
            "I have - another question on this topic, Regarding the older recording, How the older collection would be done? Directly from the event organisation, from the event recoring facilities, or - So - so - is there any recording facility in the, where the event will take place? Or is it something that needs to be set up for the event?",
            "So I no I don't know how much PERSON12 knows about this, I would expect, but PERSON12 should to - should double check with the organizers that they have standard amplification system, So they will probably have headsets for the speakers and there will be the standard mixing - like desk, And I hope that we will be able to - to connect to this, But I don't expect them to have any digital - any - like digitalisation of - of the sound, So I don't expect the recording would be available in any digital form and this is where we should connect.",
            "I believe that five years ago it was that the speakers had only microphones and there was the mixing pult and some computers.",
            "Good enough, we can work with that.",
            "Okay, and the - the other question was regarding the publishing of the result, Do you think - it is important also to publish the output online? Because, I mean, on a website, because the web publishing is a part of the project.",
            "Yeah, we've got.",
            "Yeah so I don't know the what exactly does PROJECT1 platform offer, We have not talked about the publication of this - of the recordings and anything like that with the organizes so we should - we should check if there they want it or if they deliberately don't want any publishing and then we will see whether these matches were the standard PROJECT1 pipeline. So I could imagine that they don't want any published videos but I could also imagine that they actually do want the extra visibility. So, we have to talk to them. So what is What if the website available that you can see the results. Okay, so the default is that it is published and they would have to opt out and there would be some extra work for you.",
            "But that's not ext no extra work, we just don't show the website.",
            "Okay, okay, yes, so - so we can even offer to them to have this published so that like other participants and remote participants can see this.",
            "Okay -",
            "The last question was regarding the - the OTHER6 ASR, because PERSON1 talked about the machine translation and - But still where is the need of the OTHER6 ASR, So who you integrate the OTHER6 ASR you've the service architecture you know the two provide the imput for the machine translation.",
            "So, just to be clear,",
            "We don't have any OTHER6 ASR, but I don't think that we will have a first manager available by - by the twenty-one by March, And I don't think we currently also don't have a machine translation system that does from to OTHER6.",
            "Yeah, so we - we do have a OTHER6 to OTHER4 and OTHER4 to OTHER6 machine translation system available on the web already, It's transformer, it's twained on individual sentences, so it will be harsh conditions for this, It's like the best performing one this year, but at the level of sentences and we the segment that will come from the ASR, even the OTHER4 one, will probaly not be sentences. So we can. You can provide sentences, full sentences, right?",
            "Exactly so we provide a flowed text that includes punctuation so you can segment on the punctuation marks and then you can translate sentence per sentence if you want to, you just need to implement a protocol and how to send the results in the correct format.",
            "So I think that the two months like January and February should be sufficient to implement this protocol, So I would like to get the technical details from you whenever you have them at hand so that I can see how different is that from the way that call our machine translation system, So that will covering at least the OTHER4 to OTHER6 translation, so this is something that we almost have at hand, And for the OTHER6 ASR - I don't know how difficult it is to train a OTHER6 ASR modul, A student of mine has done it with some other tools, I haven't done it myself and the student has left unfortunately. So, there is some data available, I can find it and I could even search for more data, And I don't have a person at hand, but I could try to find, so - So I would be rather unclear, I would say that it may be the case that we will have OTHER6 ASR as well, But it also may be the case that we won't have the modul ready for - for this try run event. And the organizers will be probably fine with this and we should do our best to - to have the modul. So I don't know how difficult is - how difficult it is to - to train a modul and - So what is - what is easier for to teach us how to do it? And we will try it? Or if we just shift the data that we have for you and then you would - you would train it for the event. What is easier?",
            "Probably teaching you how to do it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Essentialy, what you can - what you can do more or less is - You can actually train whatever toolkit you want we do some little re-training so that we have moduls for tookit.",
            "Aha.",
            "But we'll - we should discuss that offline but that is probably an easy solution - But easy - not easy but there is probably Not easy, yeah - There is probably a viable solution but still I think much as ambitious.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah so we'll - we'll see, So I think it's clear what we should communicate with the organizers of the event, And it's clear what we should discuss from the technical point of view, I know that has presented the - the ORGANIZATION3's - ORGANIZATION3 SLT or the name of the toolkit and September, So that also included the ASR part, right?",
            "Yeah, but - yea yea but that is not the toolkit that can be used in the setting so this is just a basement system and that is not fit for doing online it is not the best performing system.",
            "Okay, okay, so I'll get the technical deals from you and we'll se how far we get ourselves and it will be a nice exercise for us to get in to the - the speech of OTHER6 which in the long term we want to do anyway. So I think it's - it's a good exercise and if we succeed then we plug that in, And if we don't that it will be only OTHER4 to OTHER3 and OTHER6 with the connector that we have to ride and possibly OTHER3 to OTHER4 and possibly OTHER3 to OTHER6 via OTHER4. Yeah.",
            "Sounds reasonable.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you so - so I hope that PERSON12 or someone has taken notes on this, And we'll let you know how this - how this proceeds. So thank you very much for - for agreeing to this, We'll also be in touch with the - with the recording device like what - what type of microphones will be available for that event, We'll get in touch with the organizers and - and see as soon as we learn some technical details we will double check with you if there - if - if this is feasible or if it has to be replaced and - and we'll see how that goes. That's exactly the purpose of this try run, although it's a public one, To - to see how it behaves. And what - what problems we - we will have. So the final presentation of - of this is on the webpage, right? So people simply connect with whatever system or handheld device they have, They connect to - to the webpage and the webpage shows the transcripts or the translation, right? That's probably question for ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Yeah, I had the microphone muted - Currently - currently we can - we have not the web publishing of the subtitles.",
            "Okay, so what is - what comes out or how - what - what is the - the final end of the pipeline at the moment?",
            "As PERSON1 suggested, PERSON1 please correct me if I'm wrong, you proposed the user yo - I do not remember the name - Your component for publishing.",
            "Yeah, the website. You can use the electro translator website.",
            "Exactly the electro translator website.",
            "Yeah, okay, so I'll get acquinted myself with the lecture translator website and possibly talk to PERSON1 about the internals, Because idealy we - we think of like a secondary projector that would project the subtitles next to the speaker or as an overlay of the - of the slides of the - of the speaker and this is also something that - that needs to be like set up and found the best way for the other meeting, So it's part of the try run. Yeah, thank you, so that's that's very promising I'm - I'm very optimistic about this ofs slthough obviously it's - it's high risk business and we can see many many errors and that's - that's the point. Okay, and the last point that I have in the agenda is the logo, So, what we'll get what do you have the logo - So PERSON12 has - PERSON12 has drawn one suggestion and - yeah - So the - where - where could I get this easiest - So you are welcome to propose other - other logos, But I'll try to locate - that's not the one - from - I'll try to locate the logo - - it's not searching - Still not searching - it's too clever, so you can read all my emails now and if you resolve some of it that would be nice. We have discussed so many things - Yeah, well, I can - That's a different thing - So PERSON12 if you are able to locate the - No, you also don't have it because you're not using your - your computer.",
            "Yeah, well, I was trying to loc to locate the proposal of - of logo, by - by PERSON12 - But - O don't have - That's too many old files - Yeah, I cannot find it at the moment, It's - it's simply - is it - no - No that's not the one - - Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, I'm not able to - to show you the logo at the moment, it's - it's somewhere in my e-mail, too many e-mails, and -",
            "I have found it.",
            "Allright, exellent. So can you share it -",
            "I'll stop sharing the screen -",
            "No, I tell you where is it, it's in e-mail from 5th November.",
            "November, sorry. Too many e-mails. November - No, that's another one -",
            "To do PROJECT2 -",
            "Yeah, so that's the one but I haven't - PROJECT2 - I see - I see other attachement there, but not the ELI. That's probably the one - yeah, yeah, yeah - Finally I found it and I'm sharing my screen - And this is -this is the proposed logo, It could be - it could be simplified in some way but yeah - You're welcome to - to come of with other suggestions but we would need some logo in any case. So if - if no other proposals come from anyone else we will probably work with this and - and try to simplify a little, And possibly make it like two colour thing - We'll see. If you have any comments or suggestions to this please say so now -",
            "Yeah, I know - I know this is only a sketch PERSON11, but I think you've - you've managed to this one.",
            "Oh, okay - How much. Yes, yeah, that very important.",
            "Okay,.",
            "So we will.",
            "It's kind of actually.",
            "Yeah -",
            "I thought that little football that thing is the event in silent.",
            "That's PERSON16, the - the - f the - yeah - Like this one.",
            "Yeah, that should be LOCATION5 -",
            "It - it is.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, I think I.",
            "But minor suggestion - I'm not much concerned the bold LOCATION5 that you also aleviate alienated all the thing that is East of the LOCATION3 mountains. Seems like the continent stops somewhere - Yes. So maybe we could continue to the East of like of your globe.",
            "Yeah, so I th I think that once we try to redraw this we will probably start with the - with the Earth as it is - and - yeah - I - I - think -",
            "You could - the Earth turn upside down so that actually the South is on top and North is on the bottom.",
            "Yeah it it is supposed to be eurocentric which I think is fine, yeah -",
            "Is fine, cause I'm kidding -",
            "I - I think the - I think the concept is - is very good I think - yeah -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just the map - looks good. Yeah.",
            "It's really good. Yeah, okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah, too bad that PROJECT2 can't be translate easily otherwise it would be nice to have the translations coming out of the other end or something.",
            "Yeah, PROJECT2 is a - is a - perfect word, I - I really like it, It - it - I don't know who exactly came with the suggestion I think it was but I really like the - - the proposal - So, the name, and, yeah. So we'll - we'll work on this, If you have any other ideas or any simplifications then let us now, but we will - Our plan is to start the web - the web page which would be probably PROJECT2.eu ORGANIZATION and the logo is an essential part for that so the sooner we have one the - the better.",
            "Yeah I meant if the PROJECT2 itself was translatable to other languages it would be nice to have the translations in the picture coming out.",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "Ea of course it's not, so never mind.",
            "We don't have any OTHER1 partner so nobody is inclined to translate abbrevitions I would say - okay. So there was the - there was the end of - of the agenda for today. If there is anything that you would like to add please say so - Otherwise thank you very much and I expect you to - to have your final say for the concertion agreement by the end of the week, especially your double check that the background of other people is sufficient for your duties.",
            "Okay. You've seen my e-mail that might be delaying this - the concertion agreement.",
            "Yes, so we have - we have mentioned this before you were able to join, I'm I was not sure whether you have - you were there at the moment, so the sooner you have some comments from your lawyer the better, Hopefully it could be by the end of the week, but if you need more, yes, we can also wait more. So please let me know -",
            "Yeah, yes. This is now my third lawyer with - in five months or so of this project so -",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah fingers crossed, so - so hopefully this one survived.",
            "Let's keep our fingers crossed because the other two also live from one day on the other so - Essentially I had e-mail exchange with the lawyer on the Thursday on Friday and today I found out that she's gone.",
            "Okay, yeah, well, it's - it's hard, Maybe - maybe IT is a. Maybe lawyers are equally like jumping from side to side as - as IT people are in - in the industry, so it's - yeah. Frendic times. Okay, so thank you very much for your time and for your comments and we'll let you know how - how this evolves and we'll be in touch. Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you, bye bye, Thank you very much. thanks.",
            "Thank you, bye bye.",
            "Thank you, bye."

            "Hi, we can hear you.",
            "Then you have to mute it. Or you can set the threshold, so perhaps when if I'm quiet enough.",
            "Hey PERSON17.",
            "Hello.",
            "So somebody is on loud speakers. I can hear myself.",
            "Maybe from my mic mic. Can you hear yourself?",
            "Yes. Okay.",
            "Everybody. We cant hear you. We da we don't hear you.",
            "Okay, now. Yeah its always so yeah. But that is really strange, because I could hear myself already. And that was, I see that was from PERSON11's mic, so that was what I'm saying, so PERSON11 is sitting next to me, and he has to mute his input so that it is not captured as my sound actually. So we still don't have anyone from ORGANIZATION4, right?.",
            "You are quite loud PERSON17.",
            "Okay.",
            "But here its fine so far.",
            "I'll try to mute myself a little. So. Yeah, one question that I have on PERSON1 actually, as a technical one. How do i set it up, how do I connect so that I'm connected with my user profile. Because I would like to see the Czech translation if if possible.",
            "Then I'm I'm I'm not sure if if I got your right. But if you click on the chatbox. You see the transcription right?",
            "Yes, yeah, but they are in English.",
            "Okay, oh I'm sorry PERSON17 for ask our developers, and another development team want to participate today so I'm still waiting for him so I hope he will be there today, but otherwise I will write down your question and will tell the guys that.",
            "Yeah, how to see, so they now against sorry. So the thing is that I actually do have an account. I forgot is it PROJECT3, ORGANIZATION5 or is it ORGANIZATION5 I'll try to figure it out. Like how do I connect to the room through my account, so that ORGANIZATION5 know its myself,",
            "Okay. Okay I guess its just a different kind of settings we have to do because, we created a new company for this for this testing room. So maybe we just have to add your account to the new company. So that should be fine, but I will write it down. And we will talk.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok thank you. So are we still waiting for someone we have got PERSON5. Hi PERSON5 most of you are probably muted so.",
            "I'm here now, I'm here with PERSON13 and PERSON4 as well.",
            "Yeah, okay, great. So I'll also hide myself with. Sorry. I know that PERSON1 must be crying because we are totally like breaking the.",
            "I'm just asking myself well that's a conferencing software and everyone hides.",
            "The thing is that I'll share my screen in a second. For just sharing the document that you have access to. And the thing is that you still can see my face, but I don't see my face anymore. So that makes me like anxious about what is being sent to to all of you. Thats the reason why I prefer to, to like be hidden. If I'm hidden then if I'm hidden to myself then why should you see me. Thats the point. Ok. So thanks everybody for taking part in this call. I hope that we have not forgotten anyone that we have all partners present here. As always this session is being recorded for the purposes of minuting work package so if you do not agree please say so now and PERSON6 or rather PERSON7 will later on still get your general consence for this. I think we have done that, yeah so; please double check. That's just yeah.",
            "I think we have to know. Okay.",
            "Yeah so. Is there anything that people would like to discuss. So this is this anything people want to add to the agenda. If you have anything, any topics that you need to bring up please mention them here. And one technical question is something that we need to figure out for the next year is, how are we going to deliver subtitles through 400 people at the congress. So this is something that you can ask your network people in your institutions. What they would recommend, because we know that Wi-Fi will fail. So this is for all the technical people around who were figuring out what, so we could maybe connect some of them through wires or we could bring presentations screens to some places and the auditorium. This is all to be all to be discussed. We have quite a few months for that, but its not an easy thing to solve. I'm mentioning it. Okay, so the next important thing is the date of the pre review meeting. You've heard about this pre review already. This is, so we will have the full review after month 18,, about a year from now, or a little more, but the the project officer, would like us to have a pre review meeting for which we will need to have deliverables finished. And the soon approaching deliverables in some reasonable form, which for this. It seems that it would be good to have it somewhere between September 23 and October 4. So I will I've already asked PERSON7 to prepare Dodo for this. So please fill this Doodle rather sooner than later, when its here the link will appear here and sh will find the date. It would be remote meeting with our project officer on the call I think. And yes, and wh. But really sure about the financial data. But probably they will ask us to have some financial data, ready by then like to see how much we have spent in person, months and money. But most importantly, they were a bit checking the content of the project with its proceeding well. Then the thing that, we are really working on hard these days is the preparations for the workshop for ORGANIZATION1 which is to happen just in no the name today, because they need to register them officially as well. So here is the, the sheet, where you should enter yourself. We really think that the more people are here the better because then you will see the setting. You will see the programs live. And that will be that really helpful for various things, and the days of the workshop on that with 27 and the 28 of June, the end Friday. And there was a mistake in the dates actually. So this is an a very important message for all of you who are coming or helping with that. We got one day extra thanks to the mistake. So the mistake was that it is happening on Wednesday and Thursday. But it is actually a Thursday and Friday. So Thursday is full day session. And Friday is just the morning. And here is the place that's where it is going to happen. If you were coming and you needed any help or assistance with accommodation, or whatever talk to PERSON7. Running as smooth as possible. We have this technical document, so if you are curious. And you don't know this document by hard. Have a look. We have regular calls, and we have tested the technology today. It was mostly working. But also many things were terribly failing and some components are still missing. In general, I'm I'm very happy from the progress here. I know it is hard thing to do. And I know that all the partners involved in this are working very hard to make this happen as successful as possible. So the I'm still not confident, it will be successful dry run. But I'm not sure as any errors than I was yesterday, or the day before. So I think we are we are doing our best to be. The most important thing that I would like to remind every technical partner now would be to work on this fingerprints map. If I open that its actually nothing really at the moment yet. So what we. What we have now is only the list of languages that we need to cover. And the French is kind of unclear so the essentialy for the final end user to display language. There is all these processes and interconnected components. And the way they are connected together through these fingerprints. And if we have these fingerprints in some messes status. Then it is possible that every partner will connect their com. The pipeline will not be constructable, because the fingerprints wont match. And it will be like one more level of complexity to debug the to to have the. So so please, when you have. Whenever you are working on any component, please add the component here such as just by adding a rectangle. And saying that, this is whatever, soon English to Czech empty. And then input fingerprint is something output fingerprint is something. And we'll review pretty pretty prepare such as such boxes here, and we'll review this and make sure to notify you that your fingerprints should be said differently so that it works together. And so this is a technical request for for everyone. So thats this thats this, sorry. The fingerprints map here. And then another important thing I would like to bring up is the invitations to present. Sorr, mouse is too clever I've released my my one one of my fingers and it it requires me to lift both of them. I've received several invitations already to present PROJECT3 as a running project. With its progress and is the big data value Association summit in Riga, which conflicts with our workshop. So thats why I immediately refused for myself, but I've asked PERSON18, PERSON9, PERSON15 and maybe other. But so far, I didnt get any any response. I think it would be useful for the consortium as a whole to be represented there. And its also important for the upcoming European like project calls for projects would be able to make it. Please let me know now, and I'll forward that to the organizers. Essentially there is some match language processing workshop as part of this summit, and that the program of this workshop is still, hopefully a in preparation. So we should be able to to to get ourselves in. So they are really keen on having us. But I don't have any anyone to to be there yet. So, yeah, I don't know, if if it PERSON9, no no PERSON9, if. And all we all come up that if someone from a doctor.",
            "If someone from. Nobody else is is familiar enough with with PROJECT3. They may be anyone from anyone from ORGANIZATION8, or.",
            "I can ask PERSON18 again, but other than that I cant think of anyone.",
            "Yeah, and from ORGANIZATION4? Again, I know its hard. So.",
            "Yeah, its really bad timing cuz he is just going for a holiday and its yeah, I don't think its going to be possible its a really its. We need one person here to work because.",
            "Yeah, thats right. So the last resort would be Alfa ORGANIZATION5, Alfa training if someone would like to join this big data value association. So for you, this might be interesting. If. The long term, you would like to be a part of well the, the set of organisations that apply for your projects. So if you are happy with the. And the, and.",
            "PERSON17, could you, I'm not really clear about value of that, this summit actually is.",
            "Yeah yeah so. I can hear myself so please if you can. Yeah thank you. So the idea is that it is. So my understanding is that the Europe essentially has, collects quite substantial amounts of taxpayer money, and they want to spend them in some reasonable way and finding out the reasonable way is not easy, even for the the knowledgeable people. So what they regularly do, talk to various lobbistic organizations in the sense. And these lobbistic organizations are various associations of researchers or or research institutes or companies, working in various areas. Like buzz work or mt important buzz phrases artificial intelligence, so the people are now lining up on the various buzzwords, and they are talking to each other and then they write various reports, and and summaries of the status and summaries of the risks if we don't handle this and that. And this eventually in one way, or another makes it to the calls that the European Commission Regularly brings up. Watched topics you would like to work. So if you stay away from this. Then you will only receive the calls, and the calls may or may not be in line with your original interests, and you have to adapt to the calls, and you are only learning about the call when its up, when its actually published. If you are part of these discussions. You know, in advance, what is going to be in the calls, and you are partly shaping the calls. So it may be easier for you to adapt for it, is always open, but you have or have not the benefit of knowing whats whats behind the words. So thats thats the general reason. So there is is long-term vision of the Europe. And now in particular from the people who have have put themselves together. The under this labor big data value chain, if you work with big data, and ORGANIZATION5 does. Because you, if you take all the recordings, and you want to search them search through them. And all that coul that could be considered big data. So thats why there is this language processing workshop there, because there can be lot of language appearing in the big data. Then it might be interesting for you to know, who else is working on similar topics. Solving similar problems or, I hope I've clarified whats whats whats the value. For this, and then is obviously its one tick. So we just tick off yes. We have presented PROJECT3 at this forum. And from that we have these new contacts and these new potential customers.",
            "Yes, I will discuss this with with. And few fellow developers so. Yeah, I will give you feedback.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Thank you. The next one is metaform. And again, I was asked and I promised to to ask everybody here, because its difficult for me this day These days in October eight and nine. We are probably going to have a meeting from another project that I'm on. And so I could not against PERSON13 you were there some years ago, werent you?",
            "Its sort of its probably been more interesting than this BTB higher density of information, that more relevant. I guess somebody from ORGANIZATION4, because we will probably ask presenter or from ORGANIZATION4 may go, I dunno who I just noticed we have a bit might be bit tricky for me, cause we have a project meeting on the tenth of the eleventh. But thats in London, so, possibly, yeah possibly. Some people be able to go and may not be an PROJECT3 person.",
            "I probably have teaching them, so I'm not sure.",
            "So I may go I'll look at our somebody from ORGANIZATION4 may go. Who could be briefed about PROJECT3 at least. So, yeah, its its. I mean for me its a bit its a bit clearer to find to go to the event like. Like having the visibility forum. Useful visibility at the BDV its just a huge event, and you get lost in these events its much harder to actually have a impact I think.",
            "Okay, yeah, so there is the particle of thing that I know in the program or PDV. Is that there is this workshop. And there is the relevant people at this workshop. So I know that PERSON is is organizing organizing that that workshop, but they maybe organizing the whole thing. So yeah, so it. I think it would be a great division of labor. If ORGANIZATION5 was able to to go to Riga and just present what we are doing any if any ORGANIZATION4 could. I'll take the note. And probably nobody, but till. For ORGANIZATION5. And I'll tell the ELG organizors who have asked me that they should talk to to you PERSON13 on whether someone from ORGANIZATION4 will make it or not so thats it. So that they know its. So its. So its not sitting only in my mailbox, and and but your mailbox aswell. Thank you. So thanks a lot. And the last one that I know, and this is something for the interpreters and translators of of the European Commission, and and this is something that I'm probably going to make myself. So lets I'm not strictly asking, if someone would like to go here, please let me know. Help would be appreciated as well. But I think this can be covered. Okay. Um-hum. Thats this one?",
            "Now I created the doodle for our review meetings so you can yes.",
            "Hello, sorry. So yeah, please fill yourself to the doodle in the meantime. So then we have the milestones. Sorry, again. And the milestones we are late with the recording. But actually the recording is working fine. As far as I know, we've had last fix from France few days ago, because the timestamps were not precise enough to reconstruct the the session, but otherwise, and we are even able to up to the precision. Able to reconstruct the voice of the like join session, and we have this per stream, per person. Right, is it correct?",
            "Probably.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I think this recording is now ready, and I'm going to tick this off. So this this will be great, and then the spoken language translation prototype. I think thats essentially fulfill with to the mediator. So, I think that this is something that we can tick off as well, correct me if I'm wrong.",
            "Its SPD.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah. PERSON5 agrees, exactly. And PERSON3 mentioned something.",
            "The first point the ORGANIZATION5 recording is not working. Can I hear myself? Okay, its working now. ORGANIZATION5 recording through the PD platform that. I know we have recordings from ORGANIZATION5 when used from ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Oh, okay, I don't think that is important though. So they. The reason why we had it there. Like through the ORGANIZATION2 platform was to make sure it successfully like, and that it is capable of of delivering the translated subtitles. And we have this capacity as well. So its not recording through the platform. It is recording separately, but it is actually connected to the platform in a sufficient way. So I think that we are happy with the with the setup. So, that.",
            "Thanks for the explanation.",
            "Yeah. It is Euro side. So it should be all the possible target languages. But I think that we should be nice to ourselves here. And we should say that all the that PERSON5 from ORGANIZATION4 actually has has created are sufficient base line models. And we should tick this off at the end of the month as well. You agree?",
            "Okay, I do actually have miltilingual system, which those all of the Euro side languages or very nearly all of them.",
            "Oh excellent.",
            "It doesnt performed very well, but it does basic translation at least.",
            "And its, so can it so is it that you have trained all the source and all the target languages.",
            "Oh, no. Let me think. Yes, i think its many to many system that covers all of the languages source for target, but for any language pair that does not involve english it is going to be zero translations so probably not very good.",
            "Oh, I see. So you have to read only on data that had English on one of the sites.",
            "Yeah thats right.",
            "So could you, we can say that this is a baseline model, it is surely a baseline can we work on some evolution of this, and maybe some fine tuning? So it has been shown by some years ago, that if you do little bit of fine tuning, then suddenly, the you can like upscale, you can make zero-shot, perform much better.",
            "That that may be true, but then you have a combinatorly explosions, if you have a 100 languages, and you want 10000 times.",
            "If you is if you have these mixed batches, and within the batch you would not cover not all of the languages but, in the next batch you would be covering other ones. So mentioned to do fine tuning, not to create too many different with the other pair, With the zero-shot pairs hoping that it will improve the quality across all the pairs. This is something that has to be tested.",
            "I mean, this is something we are testing. I'm not sure we do not need to have this part of the basetime, because its still an open question even find tune on those and have it as it as a single model. If you have thousands on that transition directions will the model forget the old ones, again.",
            "So what are your immediate plans with this PERSON5? Are you? So it is it is great that you have it. So I think, we will just take this off, but we would really like you, would really be happy to you to be close to this development like to test that our cells are best set up to actually make this system useful in the many to many translation set up. So if you essentialy use this system twice. Then and you go through the English. Then all the combinations are no longer zero-shot so evaluating, highly mountable fine-tuning is, is something very interesting for, for paper. So is it, is this on your plans? And can we somehow got involved?",
            "Yes I can I can suddenly share the data I am using, and the models I've trained. Yeah, if you want to colaborate on this. So yeah, the idea is talking about about that along the same lines.",
            "Yes, so a later in the document I mention that hopefully I might have someone a student as the summer intern. And this is exactly that type of activity that I could ask him to do. Like to run the various, could even have someone for some part of the summer to work on this. I would be watching him only remotely unfortunately,, but still, like, I know from from past that was that he was able to many things running his own. And it was actually good work. But, translation. So all these milestones or in good shape. It is it is excellent news, and I need to take them of in in the system and in platform, available, and we should be seeing the subtitles right? Where are those subtitles? So this is this. I see myself talking. Should i scroll fully down, or is there some scroll to the end? And this is something that needs to be improved later on. Is is not is not scrolling in anymore, One, two, three, four, I don't see my output.",
            "So the scrolling is a little bit confusing for the moment, but it is not too bad. So I'm not only English subtitling. And so only english as our is there, but I know. And this was my question at the beginning of the call to Armen, that, if people such their language, ORGANIZATION5 client should know what is my preferred language for the subtitles. And then the workers should, should be used like automatically. So this is very much related to the fingerprints. So we eventually after the workshop, which will test all the various translation directions from English into the the six or seven languages and possibly from German into something. Then all this should be immediately available in end of August and some basic support will be there. So ORGANIZATION5 will probably keep working on the on the user interface, so that it is more usable and but, otherwise, I thing we are good, right?",
            "I'm I'm with you PERSON17.",
            "Yeah, thank you. And, there is this milestone is supervised by on the initial ASR systems. So this actually is underspecified in terms of the languages. But the aim of this milestone interpreters at the congress. So we are working on the czech ASR all the time, and we still have no real succes but we are working. And by the end of September we should be much better state than we've. So there will be a. What what other languages? German, English are fine, they are covered. Then.",
            "I can hear myself from your microphone.",
            "Great.",
            "Yes we can hear you.",
            "Yes, you, you. You. Get mixed up. Yet. He gets us.",
            "Oh a Russian yes, OK. English, French, Spanish, Russian. So thats a question for by PERSON14 and PERSON14 is not working on ASR, so, OK,. Okay. Yeah. PERSON18 mentioned that you will have something, but not the highest possible quality. So is something that you already have at hand, or should you retrain in its from scratch, because his old models and the software has changed in the meantime, or have you do you know?",
            "We we might have been. And so in the past, we will go with the Italian friends and this to turn. And this is. But for us, and I we we never will be less than. So do not know, if we we need to process in a. But it is it is, you know, it is like for you, which is where the room and everybody loves off.",
            "And then we have these language scope, which is listed here on. And here in the scope of the languages, there is the a ASR a primary focus is well covered experimental, we are working on check, but we need to cover French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian somehow. So please take this into account, And so you know that they are you. So if you were afraid that you are not going to have a baseline models for the other languages. Please talk to me. And we should we should somehow like jointly put the together to to have all these languages covered. Remember, there would be the real interpreters, who will test it student in their interpreters. I think that the ASR quality would be better than the ASR plus machine translation quality. It will be probably better to follow the the Spanish interpreters speech. So this is why it is important from the users use point of view to have this. So PERSON5 please keep this in mind, PROJECT3. And how much of what you have needs to be redone,, and how. And if you are struggling with this. Then we, for example, might try to cover Russian as well, but we have no data for this. And I would really need to like start searching for Russian data.",
            "But I mean, for Initio ASR system you need to cover Russian?",
            "And that is a hard question. So the lets. I think that if we do not and if we skip this, and then we we excuse ourselves, then will be good, but it is still good incentive to try to cover the languages that we want. So maybe ORGANIZATION4 directly on the call now. They may have access to the the resources so. I know that you have. Told me what data you use and that someone that especially the BBC data was not available for any other research. But maybe there is other things. Now we start with the a Russians were soon not well.",
            "I say, \"Well, okay. So I was used to some readers on.",
            "So please, if you can ask around and dig this up. Then the Russian is something which is not covered by anyone as of now. So any starting point would be good. So. Thank you. So this is end of end of September. And we'll see how how well this goes, but for the other milestones. I think that we are in very good shape. And here, if we if we if we reinterpret in initially, in some way, where we are good as well. So then the deliverables for internal review. This was our old plan by mid June, complete contents, internally reviewing starts, and the reviewers are listed in the deliverable sheets, which you can look up. And the overly fleings are also in the, the one, which is not finished at all is the initial training data separating confidential and public version. So. Well, I admit, I have not had chance to look at this myself, even. And I see that they will work on crawled corpus after the nineties right?",
            "That's right. I still I think i have one section to do.",
            "So here are basically three sections for this this session on Czech ASR but I think there's so far nothing in the deliverable itself.",
            "Okay. So we will see PERSON8. He's still doing is exams this week, but we will have them from the very morning Monday morning, and will make sure that he is the first thing he does would be actually writing or putting the contents to this action.",
            "Okay. And the other two parts PERSON13 and myself are responsible for so I will make sure my by early next week.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "Yeah, by, the end of next week. We will have something ready for.",
            "Which is great that will be still in time for the internal review. So who is the internal reviewer? Does anybody anybody remember?",
            "Okay, the fillets maybe she. Was his availability towards the end of the months because we will need him, and we are still working on that content.",
            "So then the periodic activity and financial report. This is deliveral number D eight point one. And this is something that we have warned. You will need input from everyone. But we have realized then needed for the mid project review, and we have talked to a project officer and based on what is the best practices in other projects such as PROJECT1 month 20, and because there is some submission policy. So this. This financial report is actually delivered in the in the PROJECT4 system, and for for the PROJECT4 system to generate, we need to close the system like freeze it. And in this frozen face you can not even add the other deliverables. So, we ensured, or we think that the timing of this is the eight point one is missplaced, and that it is relique from previous proposals essentially and with the permission of our Project Officer we will officially ask to move this deliverable to around month 18 for this. We will have this, and we need have the permission from all you to ask for Project Amendment. So an official requests from the consortium to the European commission that we would like 8.1 to month 18 or 20. This is something that will have to decide. And I'm not sure if this consent from you is sufficient now during the call, or if the signal system will then have in there that you agree with with that change. First of all I would like to ask you if if you agree with this official move of this. Deliverable, and if you do then I would like to remind you that you may need your agreement in this ecosystem later on, yeah thank you. So please maybe everybody say that you are fine with this just for the record.",
            "They are fine.",
            "Thats fine with us.",
            "I have to double check with PERSON15.",
            "Yeah, okay. So if we if we don't get this approval. If or the European commission says no you have set yourself to report our activity now and month six then we will simply do age when when or the main drawback is that we will be doing this twice now. And then also for the month 18 review. But since PROJECT1 does not have anything in month 6. Then they have the same month 18 review, you know. So if you have started already with preparing the details for this, which is various things of including like the spending and please keep this data. It will be a useful for the September pre-review. So we need to figure out what what exactly is when when talking about this, I have some vague memory of talking in person to a project officer and his data gathered for his D 8.1 deliverable. And, so that will be ready for you to look at on the pre-review meeting. So we need to contact him again. Of the system would be in clash with ourselves submitting the other deliverable. So we definitely do not want to deliver this on the 30th of of June, but it is possible that the European Commission will demand this form anyway. So we may be asked to collect the data was during the summer, even if we are allowed to officially ship this deliverable to month 18. So this is still like the mm-hmm.",
            "We had interim report because it was required FP7. This was submitted using the continuos reporting this was just PDF. It wasnt yeah. Got stuff together we use for the 18 months report. Of the periodic reporting.",
            "Yeah. So lets try to drop it, subject to the agreement from PERSON15 as well. And lets particularly investigate. What will they want from us on the pre-review meeting intail the parts like progress report. So thats thats something that would be useful to collect in any case. And lets see how strict they will be about the financial and and the month that person on spending details for the pre-review. Okay?",
            "Okay, PERSON9 please try to get concect from PERSON15 as soon as possible because today how complicated its to make an amendment, and it takes quite some time, we have to finish it before the end of June. Okay? Yes.",
            "At least the application of to the amendment and the EC will take a while to respond to that. But they will already know from our comment about this deliverable that we are not now because we amendment request. So please those who have agreed please enter yourself also in to the document, so yes. Then the data management plan, this is not finished at all, except for PERSON6's work package 5, and there is some little changes needed. So, lets open that. So the experienced people from for example the the PROJECT1 project will know what this looks like. Its a confidential deliverable essentially along the work packages, so maybe PERSON13. Or PERSON4 could you comment on the on the important of these fairness things. Cause it was uncleal to me. We did something for PROJECT1, but.",
            "This come from a really.",
            "Ok, so. This somewhere.",
            "Yes, we found a template on some official website, so we just both copied it.",
            "Yeah, because I remember that the data management plans that we had for. Were less structured, and put there essentially what we thought was important about like where and who can use it. So maybe maybe we should treat this template as and then. Whatever we don't like mentioning.",
            "Yeah, I mean for the document that is, I mean.",
            "Is confidential. So its only us if.",
            "In your experience to reviewers ever asked. But these days, management plans.",
            "No?",
            "We don't he has a habit of making things more complicated. Yeah.",
            "He's too precise.",
            "Both at the same time, you are almost impossible to hear.",
            "Yeah, so this is. I think that every work package was not done there part yet. So this is request to work package leaders, to make sure that relevant data for the work package are mentioned in one way or another in this document. So I think that the 1.1 is a great source of the details. And that the parts in D 1.1 that relate to the Czech ASR will be just mentioned here so, like for the data for the work package data we have been listed in the 1.1. And the the difference. The main difference is that in D 1.1 we want to cover only the data that we have already collected and processed but in know that we'll process later. So this is also the future. This is the past, the current status and the expected future of the data.",
            "Sorry, I mean PERSON17 is this really, so another project data management plan would be to say, these are the types of data that we'll gather and these will take this how we manage it. What what we are proposing here is actually go through TD slay list all the data sets that we actually gonna collect and all the details of them. Is that. I don't maybe thats actually what we were expected to do, I mean I mean ok so,. List all the data sets and TDS detail. Shortcut would be just to say here's our approach data management.",
            "Yeah we will rely on the data which is being released anyway for various share task and we will just mention the shared tasks and thats it.",
            "I'm not sure if this should be should be some redundancy between work package because it looks like a lot of it you can state once and then you just have a list of the different types of state rather than repeating for each work package.",
            "Yeah, ok. So I'll probably since we are responsible as the as the coordinator. For this deliverable, we'll probably try to cut this structure shorter and. But anyway, we would like from every work package leader, what their take would be. In general terms specify what types of data will that work package need and where you will get it. In general terms. And if you have particle data sets as examples please mention them. So for example, the Russian that would be nice place to, to mention Russia speech. Please every work package leader provide this input here here and I'll ask PERSON7 to somehow like put it together.",
            "So PERSON17, if its not our if its not our data why do we have to manage it, I mean, shouldn't the data management plan we actually create.",
            "I thought its the data that we use as well.",
            "In the past I've just taken we create, because really, its up to other people to manage sources that they create. I dunno.",
            "You are right. Okay, so we will probably. So we have already said that we are not creating much data. Except for the minuting for example, and the minuting is written here in.",
            "Well, I mean as I was saying I mean one of the this dry run is to gather as much data as possible about whats going through our system. Yeah, and I think the logs that was very valuable.",
            "Yes.",
            "Work. That is an example of the sort of data we gather.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So thats the data set. But we just have a paragraph. And then we, and thats all we need. All the work packages for dry run. I dunno.",
            "Agreement from the ORGANIZATION1 work for this for example. So please every work package leader which is you for the well you are for the data actually. So please put this paragraph there. And also PERSON14, if you could put something there for ASR. We'll somehow try to cut it short and polish in some simple way. Ok, so that will be this part. And then we have the the deliverable on ethics. And this is essentially done. So PERSON1 please you can start reviewing here. So if you had any access problems to this Overleaf or whatever. And any, you can either edit it directly in Overleaf or you can add PDF or whatever. And thats it. And then for the ORGANIZATION7 sheet. This is the data that we thought would be needed, within to this data will be needed for the pre-review in any case. So I would like now ask PERSON7 to quickly present this and then because I'll take a little break, and then then if I'm still not there maybe in the call so we can be very brief and and maybe skip that. So PERSON7 please remind everyone what they need to put here and they should be doing that continuously, not not only for the occasion of some of some deliverables. I'll be back in second.",
            "Okay, so. The first thing is that in the dissemination you have to update it continuously because you want to remember it when after helping, so its on the fourth sheet. And you also have to scroll to the bottom, because there is like estimated number of persons, which we reached on. So just keep filling this table. And I dunno, there is a gender so, I think some of you already fill that part, yes we are just missing from ORGANIZATION2 and ORGANIZATION5 so if PERSON1 and PERSON9 could fill the next as for the summer for publication. You just should summarize in one or two sentences what are you have what you have done, but, think in this one special will wait.",
            "Just a brief question PERSON7, only for the people involved in the project, or for the OK.",
            "I think it should be only for the project because we will later upload it into Sigma and yes so. It should reflect the amount of people working on PROJECT3.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thats all from me. Anyone has any other questions? If no, you can do start talking about your progress.",
            "Yeah, so I'm back here. So I'll try to do summary myself and if there is something missing, then mention that. And if misinterpreting something then say so as well, but lets lets make it quick. So in the data, if we if we are successful. We should even be able to use it for the workshop adaptation, well, PERSON5 has worked on the work pac on the deliverable from this work package is essentially processing well, and for the ASR regularly run their training session where six interpreters is interpreting the same input signal and we should get access to this as well, so this would be nice speech translation data but the transcript wont be available, so this would be something that would be needed to.",
            "I have to leave. So. Thank you, PERSON12 will. Okay?",
            "Thanks.",
            "And PERSON9 are you coming for the correct days? Date of the workshop, you know its the date change right.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah I heard about the date change, but its okay.",
            "Okay, so see you in two weeks, in less than two weeks. Thank you, bye bye.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Sorry PERSON17 we have meeting I have to leave.",
            "Okay, well in that case simply skip this, so please everyone have a quick read through what other are doing and enter yourself. To this, but I think we are proceeding very well and yeah so lets close the call. And otherwise thank you for your time, and also for your. Lets keep our fingers crossed for for the workshop in two weeks. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Documents - So only PERSON2 is missing, right?",
            "I guess so, yeah.",
            "So he is on a call right now so I am not sure, whether he will join us. Hopefully for at least for five to ten minutes he might. But we will see. So, but other than that I think I can start right? So, there was a call last week and basically the main thing - It was rely relay related to the integration and the new NMTAPI. So they've been some questions from PERSON12. Okay for start there will be some deliverable,, in December. But thankfully we are not expected to deliver anything. So in this sense we are not going to be that busy. Other than that, yeah. There was question from PERSON12 whether - What what we need for like navigation. What, sources,, like need to be need to be provided for the task. And like for the time being I told him that the list produced by the empty system should be fine. Again, like we will see like what methods we will come up with. And how we can - Like what we will actually implement to the final demonstration. But again, I'm not sure like I I told him that it should be fine for for the time being. And also it is expected from us to provide, separate model for PROJECT1. Because you know, it's a diffe a little bit different architecture from what, from the baseline model. What else? I will - I need to ask PERSON8 about details of the paraphraser, because we will need to implement it in PROJECT4. And we need to know like how it actually works. I I definitely don't know the details right now, so if if someone knows you can tell me. Other than that, mhmhm - Yeah, as far as we are, as we agree like other than back translation we want to provide the translation paraphrasing, right? To the outbound translation interface, which will be in the final product. Is it right?",
            "Yes, there's a plan.",
            "So far..",
            "So, okay, so so - Okay. So maybe we can - We can go to PROJECT6 experiments, because it is based on the results, right? And so far, it looks that the paraphrasing and back translation is kind of usable. Or useful for the user, right?",
            "I guess so - Just a quick update.",
            "PERSON1 set up the whole, annotation of the purpose translations.",
            "So we got some like annotations already and I put it in the figure which is in the ORGANIZATION8 document and -",
            "There was like interesting thing and also the worst thing that could have happenned is that quality estimation worsens user confidence and also worsens the translation quality.",
            "So what are the current findings?",
            "Well, the current findings are that -",
            "So just PERSON6, look in the look in the picture in the -",
            "Yeah, yeah. I can see.",
            "Yeah, okay so - So if you look at the first column, so that's the only column where the confidence, the lighter red is above the darker red. Which means that the confidence of the users without the quality estimation is higher than with quality estimation. And the same holds for the quality marked by the green arrows.",
            "And yeah - And your question was?",
            "So so what are - What are the conclusions you have right now. I'm I'm just trying to - I am reading the -",
            "So this is just the observation so far, it is no like -",
            "I put this up in like twenty minutes ago, so - I don't know.",
            "Okay.",
            "But like it's - We will have to report that that quality estimation worsens, which is like which is by itself not good. And also with close contradiction with previous paper.",
            "Okay. Is it -",
            "Oh I get it, okay so the quality estimation -",
            "Sorry, sorry is in contradiction with the TBML now?",
            "Yes. Because in TBML help.",
            "Yeah, but it was on smaller scale and yeah.",
            "But, but - It's still very awkward to have to report this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. That's why you are like kind -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm just thinking that confidence in the Czech MT systems, Czech one, two and three is like the highest in Czech two which is which is the fastest one.But the overall quality was highest with the strongest one. So the time plays a significant role, it appears.",
            "I think it's -",
            "Okay.",
            "Everything in this graph is easy to explain.",
            "Without that quality estimation, or or like also the quality estimation could be like easily explained. But we have to avoid the knowledge that we have a different like conclusion in the previous paper.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because, like in the - Like from these we can we can say that okay the quality estimation, module is kind a - Also told us that it's not the best one.",
            "And so the quality estimation in this version doesn't help. And it's also like less confident for user or -",
            "Or users are less confident when like looking at the output of this. Because like the low quality combines with low informativeness there, so -",
            "Yeah what I am just thinking like when we are going to write the paper, and the reviewer is going to take a look at this. And they are going to look at the same graph, but like -",
            "Okay we just -",
            "And then I gonna to say like -",
            "They are claiming, they are claiming that it - We just say that: okay, they they claim that it helps, but we did it on the larger scale, and it proved it doesn't help so much and, yeah -",
            "Okay.",
            "At all.",
            "Oh and that -",
            "I don't know, like -",
            "And the quality estimation module is the same one that was used in previous experiments?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, so fair enough.",
            "Like it it I think it happens from time to time, especially when you are working with the human annotation that -",
            "Okay,.",
            "I think it -",
            "Okay s. Is acceptable. We definitely would defend it somehow.",
            "So just just to be in the picture you are currently trying to write the paper for the NASEL, right? Or -",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, and you're confident about -",
            "The good thing the good thing here in this picture is that -",
            "Czech systems are as we expected -",
            "Like as you said, the student is like users are more confident.",
            "Well that that it was news for me.",
            "And the system - Sorry?",
            "That the that the fact that student one, the fastest one is - Like provides more confidence was is news for me.",
            "As I thought the strongest one would have the highest confidence.",
            "Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, it's not yeah, yeah. You're right, it's not what we expected, but this is like.",
            "This is like good findings.",
            "This is good finding, yeah. That like we can -",
            "So if understand it -",
            "The the it's speech or something - So -",
            "In terms of the quality the stu the teacher is better.",
            "So if I understand it correctly the users are more confident if they get the response faster?",
            "Yes. Yes, it seems to.",
            "Okay. Like if the if the system is processing it too long they they start to like sort of doubt the quality.",
            "Yes. Maybe we can also, we can also compare how many tries did they do. Like compare -",
            "If the people get the other graph, you will se this like I sort of explain that. The one I put just in there. You just -",
            "Difference versus the the request and the time and the. I mean, we don't have to think about it now -",
            "Yeah, sorry for coming late. And like like being fairly lost in the graphs so far, and - But thanks for the the analysis. So let let me start over with some things. The Czech one, two and three, which is which? The -",
            "Czech one is big, the Czech two is student of Czech three. The Czech three -",
            "Okay. Yeah, so - So the the relation between Czech one and Czech two is, expected. It's, - And the relation - Both is expected, but what is unexpected, kind of is the reversed behavior of the confidence score for Czech two versus Czech three. Yeah. And -",
            "Our explanation is, or my explanation is that the the users are confident more confident with the student model, because it is faster.",
            "Yeah, and -",
            "That's I I want to maybe we can,, prove it, by comparing number of reponses or how much time they spent like on Czech two systems or and Czech three system. Because like in the following graph it's not showing this. Here you can see only like how the time depends on the confidence score.",
            "Oh well, I don't understand the second graph at all yet. But to to ask the er, the if I understood correctly, what what PERSON1 just said at this moment. Is - My understanding would be that if the system is fast, then people can do more edits. And the through these more edits, through these quicker interchange with the, with the translation system. They will be more confident about the result they have created.",
            "No. No, this is not the case, because if you take a look at the second graph. At the red line.",
            "You will see that like the highest confidences don't have that much like requests.",
            "Okay, so the the mid - When the when the users are not so confident, they make the most, in like interchanges requests.",
            "Okay, but beyond this average overall system. And we should look at the such graph only for Czech two and Czech three, because -",
            "When you have like slow systems, and you like -",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "You have like, very slow response, you just try it only twice or three times and you don't bother.",
            "Okay. That makes sense, thanks.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And what is this time plot? It's the confidence, the time is the highest, if the confidence is like - It took me lot of time then I'm not so confident about it. And, sometimes I'm very fast,, and very confident. That's the five, that's the the the rightmost -",
            "We we think that the rightmost thing is having influence by short segments.",
            "Exactly, yeah. And the source text length, so - The confidence -",
            "Oh, actually. I'm I'm sorry. I just put another graph in there. Which explains - I I we would move on very f soon. Just if you take a look at the following -",
            "The following table. There is like the comparison of, of actions in -",
            "And we will see that the fastest one produced twice as many allow for twice as many actions.",
            "Okay. And the actions is when the user is actually doing some typing, or -",
            "Yeah, like waiting for, yes, waiting for, to translate.",
            "Yeah. So what is what is really interesting here from like from the l usability of of this whole set up is that a fast system can lead to lower quality. And yet make the users more confident. That is that is risky, very risky, thing. Which - This is something that we do not want to to achieve. So, like we do not want a fast system that deceives. We, the -",
            "Well, like if the cus. That depends, the customers are more happy with that than -",
            "Well, but the translations were worse.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I mean, everything it depends like if I were ORGANIZATION8 and wanted to like push my PR. And give the people free MT then like then being content is more important than -",
            "More important than having it right, yes. I agree. But, I don't think that we should take this every action, because in the long term this would backfire. Like this is -",
            "Okay so perhaps we spend too much time on this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We can move on, but just we have some results. And -",
            "This is good. I really like the results it's, it's great. And so this PROJECT1 cores that is already.",
            "This is PERSON1 actually, so -",
            "PERSON1.",
            "Yeah, yeah it's, yeah PROJECT1 it's rather connected with data augmentation experiment and -",
            "We are working on with PERSON7 and just after, our call we have like call together to interpret it. But yes -",
            "So I thought it's, let me explain it - I will just make it larger.",
            "Yeah, I zoomed to two hudred and that was readable.",
            "Yeah. Okay, okay, sorry. I will zoom it as well. Okay. So there are like eight graphs. Each one is with different proportion of monolingual back translated data. Like the full proportion one hundred percent of monolingual, back translated data is like four hundred four hundred millions sentences or senten yeah, sentences.Translated to back to English, and, I mixed this monolingual back translated data with either back translated Chang. Or, Chang back translated in the way that or let's call it diverse Chang. Diverse translation of Chang. Back to back to English. Which is, that diverse translation it is called para in this graph. And it's the blue line and the normal back translation is the red line, it's the BT. And the dotted lines -",
            "Sorry, clarification question, the the position where the solid line starts.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Does that depend on the ratio of of the mix, like if it's hundred percent or half a percent of this mono BT or not?",
            "Oh, I don't think it depends. It just, so I ran the pre-training, it's the dotted line.",
            "And, so the pre-training like is performed on the mix of, the back transla or the monolingual back translated data. And the parallel back of the Chang back translated. Either one way or the other one. And then I run the fine tuning on the gold data, on like authentic Chang. And the solid line is the fine tune and I tried to run it on, like on with the configuration or the pre-training configuration that appeared to be best on the development data.Here it it's like, sometimes it's hidden here, because like when - In the meantime, I run the or run the pre-training till the seventy seven hundred fifty K updates for all the systems. But at the time when I was running the the fine tuning. Those pre-training stopped at different points. So that's why like they start from different points. And at those time there these points were like the best like best performing models. As I have some cri stopping criterion there.",
            "And or I ha I used to have stopping criterion there. Or different stoppe stopping criterion that when the cross entropy doesn't, improve for ten times. Or ten for ten checkpoints, it stops. Now like this week I I continue training the pre-train models. And the stopping criterion was trained just until you reach the seven hundred fifty, fifty thousand.",
            "So the these longer curves are created from the the runs, which were launched only after the fine tuning has actually happened. So the fine tuning was fine tuning from a different run,, then, the the the dotted lines here. But because PROJECT4 is luckily deterministic. I don't quite believe that. It's still, like the the the behavior the learning curve until, that point - So for example, if you take the very top left picture.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And if you look only at the red line. So you made a first run of the, of the pre-training, and that stopped at whatever four hundred fifty. And based on the dev set four hundred was the best starting point. So you launched the fine-tuning model. And the fine tuning model ran and and then stopped. And then later, when you were doing the analysis you've also ran the the pre-training fully from zero to a seven hundred.",
            "No no no. No -",
            "You continued.",
            "Like I continued with the trainings.",
            "Okay. Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "So okay, so. As you are saying, like like in the first run of pre-train, pre-training let's say that these red curves stopped at five hundred thousand iterations.",
            "Iterations and these four hundred appeared to be the best like -",
            "The best yeah. Yeah. Okay.",
            "This is actually like this is the sliding average or moving average so so sometimes it doesn't appear that it's the best, but like -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The point is the best.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "And then so then I ran the fine tuning from the best point until five hundred thousand. And this week I just continue with pre-training until seven hundred fifty.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just to see and - All of the system actually continued to improve already in the in the pre-training scenario. And so -",
            "So why why -",
            "It's the observation here -",
            "Why why do we see such a huge jump in the performance thanks to the fine tuning? So how different is the original task and the and the fine-tuning? Why why do we see this this jump, especially for the blue curves?",
            "Because there is like in pre-training there is no authentic data.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "And so in fine-tuning like the first time when the the system encounters authentic data is the fine tuning. So that's why it improves one more Bleu point.",
            "Yeah and and -",
            "And like what we want to compare is like the blue lines and the red lines.",
            "And whether this strategy achieved the diverse translations, whether it helps the the system to improve better, and it seems to be okay. It's not yet finished, but but, it seems to me that it it's better when like we don't have so many, monolingual data available. Or when when we use just the parallel data back translated or with some like additional -",
            "So this is better setup course oppose to which picture? The oh point five percent mono BT?",
            "Like w in what terms better setup? Like - That it's a - That the the blue line is better, or -",
            "Well you you said that it's better to use not so much of monolingual data. So not so large synthetic part of the of the training corpus, right?",
            "Yeah, but, for for one point five.It's like like the the largest gap - Yeah, okay, I I don't have this conclusions for the fine tuning yet, but -",
            "Just looking at the pre-training.",
            "Okay, so just looking at the pre-training.",
            "Pre-training -",
            "We're looking for the largest - Gap.",
            "Blue line and red line.",
            "Seems to be bigger for the systems when we don't this so many monolingual data. And in fact when we have one hundred it's still being trained.",
            "With one hundred percent monolingual data. Here it seems to be that the back translation would be better. Already in in when we are using fifty percent.",
            "Yo, well I suggest that you would actually plot the difference between the red and blue line. And you would see how f how that differences varies across these conditions.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I'm just looking at the at the curves now, I would not say that - So I s agree that I see the blue curve following the the red curve in the hundred percent case. So in - If you have only the fully monolingual data for synthetic data, there is no, difference between the red and blue. And so so what is the red and, the red and blue? The, the one of them uses -",
            "It's the way how, how you translate the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The colour -",
            "The synthetic -",
            "The parallel corpus.",
            "The the the parallel corpus. Yeah, and the the more diverse is the one with para.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So if you have only monolingual data, if you use only synthetic data. Then the more diverse back translation system is of no use. It doesn't help at all.",
            "If you have fifty percent, of, your monolingual data, so not so - Not so large monolingual corpus. Then a training on this diversifying, set is actually worse, blue is on the -",
            "Yeah, but it could be also worse for one hundred percent, but the blue line is not yet finished.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That's true. Yeah. Okay. And then if you have twenty five percent of monolingual data than the blue is higher, so using diverse, outputs is is better. But I would not say, that, the gain is further improving. As you move to twelve point five. I think that that the twelve point five difference at the end is very similar.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "It's it is slightly bigger - But, then er six point twenty five it's again narrower.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. O. Yeah. Okay, I I didn't want to say that like, okay, that there is a some dependence, inner dependancy -",
            "On on this. I just observe that for those data set when we do not use so much monolingual data, the gap is there, and the blue system is better than the red one. And which doesn't here happen in the systems where we use like more than half of the monolingual data. Yeah. But yeah. I don't know, whether the the plots wouldn't be different, if I use different, randomcy.",
            "Or yeah. I'm not sure.",
            "So do it with one of the setups. Just run one more of the baselines that -",
            "Yeah with different randomcy.",
            "Yeah. Only one of these plots to see how how different they would look.",
            "Yeah, I I still - Yeah, that's that's a good idea and I would like also to I would like to run the the fine tuning. Like on the currently best pre-trained models, because most of the models has improved when trained until seven hundred fifty. So I would -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just train another fine tuning and let's then see what -",
            "Yeah.",
            "What would be the result. And I'm going to talk with PERSON7 as well and maybe he will have more ideas.",
            "So this is yeah - The the if I. The summary of the set up overall. It is a tool or input, you get the original sentence and then one paraphrase, right? No it's multi source -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "No no, it's not multi source. Yeah, we call it multi source but still I need to create -",
            "So this is mostly data augmentation.",
            "Data augmentation. This is data augmentation. So it's using - It's just just the single source translation.",
            "But instead of back translation back translated data we are using -",
            "Aha.",
            "Data which are back translated in a way that are that are diverse enough from the original translations. Or actually from the original sources, or I don't know. Like in Chang they are like most of most of the Chang tags sources are in English, I guess. Or I I'm not sure. But so so the the way how we create the para data set is is to be as different as possible from the original Chang. I mean, the the English sentences, English side of the corpus. So this is no multilingual setup.",
            "Multi multi source, multi source.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Also do you think about using all the data at once and using some text to, mark the the source, instead of fine tuning? Because like use all the training data from the beginning, but use some label at the start of each sentence. Because in my experience,, this kind of fine-tuning on some lot of, monolingual data or synthetic data it will sometimes help in Bleu scores. But for example the named entity translation gets really creative while we use when we fine tune on the you get better Bleu scores. But when you analyze just like city names or something like that. It starts to translate them very creatively instead of copying the names. And then you use at least I saw that few times when you use the text,, you have like more consistent, consistent, yeah, this kind of phenomena are more consistent, when not switching to data for the fine tuning. And the Bleu scores are basically the same. But definitely better than mixing everything from the beginning without the text.",
            "Yeah.We haven't tried it. It's good idea. It's a - This is this was just maybe PERSON7's idea to do it in in this like in the folowing setup. To start with the pre-training on on a back translation and continue with the fine tuning on on the open data. Because he read it somewhere in the private ORGANIZATION3 guidelines that it's the best best thing to do.",
            "I see.",
            "Yeah we can like from our experience, or from experience of PERSON5 we can say that best thing to do is just to alternate the blocks of authentic and synthetic data. And continue like still like switching them.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah.That's that's -",
            "Yeah and this is what you are mentioning the third option what to do yeah. So, yeah, it's worth to try it but I'm afraid -",
            "Sure, sure. Because -",
            "Yeah, yeah. Because when I was doing the same thing as PERSON5 did alternating stuff that's where I found out that this happens quite in a lot of systems that you will get better Bleu scores. But when you try collect translation of named entities, the checkpoints, which have the highest Bleu scores, which are - When when you take checkpoints from the back translation part of the data. When you are training on the back translations basically s then it often translates the named entities when it shouldn't. Just it's just like more creative, when -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The checkpoints trained on monolingual data, so that's what why I was asking.",
            "Yeah, it's a good idea. And it's observation as well. We have to think about it. But yeah, I want to finish this as soon as possible, and then continue with through it multilingual. Because this was just side track of the multilingual, sorry multingual, multisource research.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And this appeared to be like more promising, the than the multisource and - But we want to finish it. But yeah, yeah and what's the when you are in the test time, you are giving the like you're -",
            "You have the the English sentence and you just it with the authentic tag.",
            "Well, also that's that's what I didn't look into that much. But in terms of Bleu scores, it seemed that it doesn't matter that much. But like I had three tags. Czech monolingual, English monolingual and authentic para.",
            "And, yeah, the Czech monolingual which was like a monolingual Czech data back translated into English. I was translating from English to Czech and the Czech monolingual had the the worst Bleu scores. But I would - I would expect that the like fluency of the sentences might be better. And the Bleu score the lesser Bleu score will be an artifact of the test set. Because the test set I used was English sentences translating into Czech, so the other way around.",
            "So it was probably like the system it was disadvantage for this tag that it generated like nice Czech sentences and not English to Czech translation.38: 06 But, you know, as I was that for client work I didn't really have time to look and look into that that much.So I didn't know, but in terms of Bleu scores the authentic, or or the English mono tag worked basically the same and the Czech mono tag was worse.I think that could be it could be interesting to analyze that further, because I I think the sentences would have much more fine grained differences than just Bleu scores based on the back used.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah you're right.",
            "So can we move to the next task, or?",
            "So PERSON11, do you have any updates for us?",
            "Hey, hi everyone. Yeah, I I hope, I was hoping to have some results for today, but -",
            "But I don't yet. I'm running it again 'cause I I found some errors and -",
            "And to be honest I spend too much time on the documents for visas, so it -",
            "Okay.",
            "Hopefully you have them today, probably at least part of them, because - And to be - Just to be clear, I'm I'm now I'm really trying to run the the constraints the lemmatized constraints.",
            "Because we found that that issue with the the words and adjectives to - Sorry the section of constraints -",
            "So yeah, yeah. So basically yeah. What PERSON11 was doing, he generated the constraints directly from text, without lemmatization.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And sometimes if if one one word is kind like if one word generating by the translator breaks the agreement and the constraint can confuse it. Because it doesn't expect that exact word form eventhough the word is correct, or the constraint is correct, like semantically.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is it understandable PERSON2?",
            "Halfway. So my understanding is -",
            "So we want to we want to check how how how the behavior of the stem when when the constraints are provided as as lemmas.",
            "Which I expect will still kind of break it somehow. And then the other plan is to try some methods to like provide either provide the possible word forms of the of the constraints. And and let the system choose which one is most suitable like this kind of approach. We don't know exactly how like -",
            "Yeah. So and again is it positive or negative constraints?",
            "This is positive constraints, yeah.",
            "Positive constraints, so you want to make sure that the output will contain a particular, now the user specifies the Lemma. And you are happy whenever -",
            "Yes.",
            "You find any form from that lemma.",
            "Yeah, so again, like if if we specify lemma, the system will try to output that exact surface form that lemma in the output which obviously will - 41: 42.",
            "Like it makes sense that it will break the break the decoding.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So what we can do is that, you know, we can generate all possible word forms from that lemma, and give the system a a set of forms.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and some some softer restriction like do not include all the forms, but only one.",
            "Any of them would be good.",
            "Yes. So that's that's those are some initial ideas like, you know, maybe there might be some more another approach.",
            "Another idea would be that you lemmatize on the fly.",
            "Yes. Not necessarily lemmatize, we can do some kind of stemming. Like we can take just the root or not the root, the stem of the word and leave it for the system to choose the correct word ending.",
            "Well, lemmatization is a deterministic,, well. Do deterministing mapping if you go into set of lemmas, and then - So the system decides to produce the word cats and to lemmatize it into cat.",
            "And maybe cats would be also a short version of, concatenates. So imagine that some - We would have we would have like crazy, the lemmatizing systems that concatenates also converts into cats. And then you would have two lemmas, one lemma would be cat and and another lemma would be concatenate.",
            "And we were expecting the system to produce the word cat. There was our constraint. So you would check that the word cats which it has produced does include the lemma cat, which is one of the required lemmas. So now, the constraint is is satisfied.",
            "Yeah, well, not necessary like this, we take the lemmas from the pipe. So it's like the best possible lemma. Like that's predicted by the system. So it is deterministic with regards to the current input, but it doesn't produce all the all the possible lemmas for a word.",
            "Yeah. So you run pipe regularly during decoding, no?",
            "No, no, no, it's pre generated.",
            "It's pre-generated?",
            "So so -",
            "So what I'm suggesting is that you run the lemmatization during decoding. But it's a hard to link it that way probably. So -",
            "Okay, yeah, that would be very tricky. And I don't think it will give us any improvements again. I think the stemming is better approach then lemmatization. Because, if if you if you wo verbs, for example \"davat\" and word form in the text would be \"da\", \"dava\" -",
            "Then obviously the ending of the lemma \"davat\", the \"at\" would confuse the system. Because it it will try to output the whole lemma first and then decode the third, the rest of the sentence. It it doesn't have the system like the LMT system has no notion of, - It hasn't - Yeah, like it decodes tokens. It doesn't even have notion of words, technically, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "We just have some tokens that together shows -",
            "Collected -",
            "Yes, so we can reconstruct word boundaries. But again like it's not train or i -like it's not an, attribute of the system to to sh to know where the word boundaries. So, yeah I don't know like there might be chance to try to enhance it or do some joined training, but this seems like too tricky to start with. Like we can like try it later, if we are run out of simpler ideas. But again right now - Yeah, we want to see like what's the difference. If we use the lemmas as a hard constraint. Like maybe we will see that in some cases, it might be helpful. So if we can identify and might helps us to build better herristic. But, yeah. Still we are just probing the system.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I hope to have it the Bleu score for them today and we can -",
            "Analyse this. And also,, we have to have to implement correctly the the combined constraints which which is, using constrains from from different references. And this is this, was almost, finished, but -",
            "So, I'm I'm trying to finish as well -",
            "And I think that we can compare, everything together. But -",
            "So so just just to remind PERSON2 the the combined constraints it means that we have two referential sentences that we use to generate constraints. And we want to take constraints from both sentences like let's take one token from each.",
            "But we do not want to take two tokens that are synonyms, or identical words, right? Because like it would be hard to want to translate dog as as a dog, and canine at the same time.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. But if we take like two two different constraints like two different wordings from two different sentences. We hope that it might provide another novel sentence or translation.",
            "Novel sentenece, exactly, yeas.",
            "I think that's the motivation. So that's that. I would like to ask PERSON11 when when are you going to the ORGANIZATION2? This week? Is it tomorrow or Wednesday?",
            "Yeah, today, I'm I'm tonight actually I will be travelling to the to the first city and then I'll take the plane to -",
            "To the second one tomorrow.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And then then it will be on Wednesday, yeah.",
            "On Wednesday.",
            "Okay, so so PERSON13 asked me to book you a flight ticket to Czech Republic, so we can discuss it later this week. Like what is the date that suits you the best.",
            "Yeah, regarding the date I I we can discuss it later, yeah.",
            "Yes, definitely that's no problem.",
            "Because I have to think it carefully, because I I Iwas thinking about the the Christmas and New Year, and it will be a bit strange, but -",
            "Let's try to avoid it, but if not, if not possible, there is no problem.",
            "Okay.",
            "The flight is usually cheapest on the New Years Eve and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I thought about that.",
            "But but speaking of travels, colleague of ours PERSON3 told me that the airplanes are actually the safest in terms of Covid. Because they change the f all the air every sixty seconds or something like that.",
            "Oh, that's good.",
            "The airport is different -",
            "So -",
            "The airplane itself is safe.",
            "I think the Czech Republic is not save in terms of in Covid.",
            "Yeah, obviously.",
            "You will not meet many of us when you are arriving.",
            "But the numbers are getting better, I think. That's before you are here actually the numbers will be, better again. And the rest of the world will be will be struggling.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we were we were the worst recently. And now while others are quite catching up.",
            "Yeah, but it is so last for one or two months.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You you are always one step ahead.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And then LOCATION1 will be devastated again.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So let's not get to side track. I wanted to ask PERSON2, like based on the results PERSON11 will here have during this week. I was suggesting we might have a call, separate call for the list discussion. Maybe some like what to do next.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "For the for the flective languages. Probably together with PERSON10 too. Maybe this maybe next week, I don't now, let's let us know. I can send the notification via e-mail and you can you can let us know when is it suitable for you?",
            "Well. Let's - Well this week is also possible.",
            "Like when are you free.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Okay, so but still PERSON11 PERSON11 will be busy with with with the ORGANIZATION2 and -",
            "And visa, yeah.",
            "We can we can leave it for the next week.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or maybe this week Friday I guess.",
            "Yeah. Friday will be here.",
            "So PERSON6 we have a meeting at, on Friday at eleven, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So maybe after that?",
            "No, no, after that is lunchtime. But yeah, it would definitely be good to do it at least at one one p.m. because you know -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Actually twelve might be good, because we had the daylight saving. Like time shift and now it's only four hour difference, right? So eight a.m. at LOCATION1 in LOCATION1 should be okay, right PERSON11? Okay, so we can -",
            "We can do also s like at one or whatever.",
            "Okay, so like push it to one. So we can go to lunch.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, that's that and maybe - Yes, yes. Just just quick, question for PERSON10. Like how is who is the embe, implementation going.",
            "Yeah, so I run some experiments on the stuff I've already have implemented with the data.",
            "But it's just very basic, negative constraints. One is - Two of them are based only on some words, because no -",
            "Okay.",
            "No notion of some hold tokens or multi multi token constraints.",
            "And one is to, filter, the beam if there's a add token that should be there, just fill out the beam. And the second one is to, add or subtract some score from logits that are in the in the list. So you can do posit, positive and negative constraints with that.",
            "And in different different different weights.",
            "And I generated a constraints as a - The constraint was the translation without added constraints.",
            "And I evaluated it on the references on one ten or thousand references.",
            "And I looked at the relationship between the Bleu score of the constraint translation against the references. And the Bleu score of the constraints translation against the original translation to see how diverse it is.",
            "Well, it seems that sub-board of the logit bonus,, or, negative bonus, works little bit better. But it's not easy to extend it for longer longer constraints.",
            "Whereas of the beams you you know what your logit generated. So you know that you are inside some constraint or something like that.",
            "So for now, yeah. For - If you look only at the sub-boards it seems it's better to mess with the logits. But in terms of further further implementation I will do the, beam filtering.",
            "Okay, so so - But you're already working with the trees, right? Like as as suggested in the -",
            "Yes, the trees are not yet implemented that's what I'm working on.",
            "Okay,.",
            "Also I - These experiments were to generate just paraphrases, not to improve translation. But I also tried to improve the translation by selecting the the negative constraints as tokens that are in in the, hypothesis generated by the system. But in none of the references, except the first one, and I evaluate it on the first one. But still that's kind of cheating, because the tokens from the first one all all the tokens are I guess -",
            "Bad.",
            "Are still there. But, yeah, it did improve the Bleu scores from like eleven to thirteen. So it's more like sanity check, I guess, because it seems like cheating.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's interesting like I think if you if you like, test the implementation more this week or like finish the finish -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Everything the other stuff and then like join the discussion on Friday it should be good. Like we can definitely decide on more detailed approach toward towards this.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so I hope that's there's nothing else to discuss, because we kind of like overextended.",
            "By half an hour, right?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, is that everything we wanted to discuss, I guess. Or otherwise we like we can discuss it next week.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe we -",
            "Just with PERSON2 and -",
            "PERSON4 asked us to like to the job that we should do for her. And PERSON13 asked me whether vouchers are good idea. And I don't think so, especially ORGANIZATION5 vouchers.",
            "Yeah. So that's. So you share my opinion. I also - PERSON13 also asked me, this. So I also don't think that we should be paying Czech people with ORGANIZATION5 vouchers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So in that case -",
            "It is possible, okay ORGANIZATION4 vouchers or ORGANIZATION6 season vouchers, but for sure that money -",
            "That's - Yeah, the money would be the best. So if if we do the money, then, well, PERSON13 has to figure out how to receive the the funding and how to pay it then. But it it should not be that complicated. So, like, technically, I know this from the coordination, point of view. Now in PROJECT2 we receive the funding from everybody like for for everybody. And we are now sending it to the, to the universities, to the partners in the consortium. So I think that we can simply do s any money transfer, and then - So the actually the easiest way is probably that we pay it from our budget so far. And then, we will see how much it was in Czech crowns, and how that converts to Euros. And we will ask for that money Euros and full stop. And they will send those to us. So.",
            "Okay, just maybe - I do'nt know who is now in charge of this, because I'm - Like like who should response to PERSON4? Because I don't think I am right in into financial stuff.",
            "Yeah, but but the technical - So the technical part. Do we already have the inputs for the people and do we know -",
            "No, no, no. She's no, she's didn't send us anything.",
            "Yeah. So how how is it planned? So we are going to provide the people, right? So we will send e-mail addresses, and she will distribute the work to towards them, or whatever.",
            "I think they will prepare the annotation environment. And, I will be the contact person who will who will send those the jobs or like the tasks to to the people.",
            "And -",
            "And how -",
            "I'm not sure, like I think this will be this will be like negotia. Or or I don't -",
            "This is still -",
            "Know details.",
            "This is - This still needs to be negotiated. Yeah.",
            "Still has to be negotiated.",
            "So my little worry is if they, like,, how much money do they want to pay to them. Do they already have that established or not?",
            "No.",
            "Yeah. So -",
            "Or or like PERSON4 was waiting for -",
            "For us.",
            "For our response that isn't possible. And I didn't know, and I asked you or PERSON13 and twice and didn't response.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Sorry. So what what would be kind of bad, is if we were using the same people that do the annotations for us.",
            "Yes.",
            "And if the price was substantially different. So for example, if they pay double the money that would be bad. I think, because it would for the for the final participants. It was seen that they have the same type of contract with the same institution, and suddenly the prices, the the double the price. So that's, that's something which I want to avoid. In that case,, the, the vouchers would be better, t in any form of. I don't not know if, s.",
            "Yeah, but yeah. So maybe like this is something that, just write it to the e mail to PERSON4 and PERSON13. Because I don't think I'm in charge of these financial stuff. And yeah, I just I would just repeat what you just said to me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then I will be just, just the pipe who's sending the stuff between you and PERSON4.",
            "Still it would be faster then I I'm on -",
            "Yeah, or tell it to PERSON13 because she has more information about financial stuff.",
            "Yeah I was I was discussing this with PERSON13 today, and I, said that the vouchers - I don't find the vouchers a good idea. And if you're the second one who doesn't like the idea, then let's not go for the for the vouchers. And, that's that's it. So well, I'll try to look at the e-mail.",
            "And if there's nothing else, we can probably just end it here, right?",
            "Yeah, okay. I agree.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So see you next week.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",

            "Yeah let's, so as so I hope that everybody's fine with recording of the session for the purposes of the project. The minuting exercise. We will decide later on whether we can actually publish this as part of the corpus that we will collect, but for the purposes of project, your voices will be recorded. And and we will review what you have said, and we will transcribe this and we will try to like use this as a test case for for the minuting exercise. So if, I hope, that everybody's OK with this. If not, please, let me know. Now, or by command to the chat or whatever. Okay. So you can now start the recording.",
            "Oh, sorry. I guess i'll should.",
            "Instant.",
            "It's already started.",
            "Okay. I did not. Yeah, So there is no indication of that, or yes? Yes, there is.",
            "On the bottom of the main panel.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there is too many buttons. OK. So thank you, everybody. And I will try to share my screen now, is it sharing my screen?",
            "It is. It is working!",
            "Excellent, so. The agenda for today has grown in the last few minutes, but that's okay. Let me quickly tell you the status of the agreements. So it took a while until we, like discovered all the buttons and and steps that all the partners have to do, but at the moment, I believe that we have correctly submitted everything what was needed by the ORGANIZATION1 to consider our ground agreement. Remember, the ground agreement is the agreement that is signed by all the partners, and also the the funding party, the ORGANIZATION1 commission. And it, contents everything, the budgets. It contains also the detail description of work, which is essentially what we have written in the proposal in the in the past. So this is the the work packages the deliverables, the milestones, the timing, everything. So that is that is in the system. And the now it's submitted, so we cannot edit it anymore. If the ORGANIZATION1 still finds, something strange, they re-open it for us and then correct it. But hopefully it's, we have already gone through this, and hopefully, this is finished. I'm not totally sure, when this is to be signed. At one point, I understood, that the grand agreement is being prepared, Like at the same time was consortium agreement. And then the consortium agreement should be signed before the grant agreement. So, we'll see. The most important thing is, that the very ultimate deadline for the ground agreements, signature is the December of 18th, but that's very late. So I actually expect this to happen several weeks before this deadline. So are there any comments or questions to the status of the ground agreement? Yeah, yeah. If not, then let's move to the consortium agreement. And the consortium agreement is this sign. Is is the document that is signed by all the partners, but not the funding party. And the, the main reason reason to have this consortium agreement, is to commit everybody to provide the resources, that are needed for the project. So that we can cooperate freely and can focus on the research and do not be slowed down by licensing and and all that. So that, so this consortium agreement like, says the, the working environment, with respect to resources, nice for us researchers. And and also for for all the other partners, and the team. And then,, the other things, that are held by the consortium agreement concern, also like the running of that o of the project, so that some formal aspects that we have this. Board, where every partner is represented by one person. And and things like that, how often we meet formally, and this is our and the coordinators duty to to prepare such meetings, and and so on. And other sections talk about the dissemination of their results and their exploitation. So if. In in essence, everybody can exploit things, that they have created alone, as they would be able to exploit anyway. And for shared results, there has to be an agreement between those, who have who have contributed to that shared result. So that's that's in very rough terms, what is then precisely written in consortium agreement. So, has everybody, browsed or carefully read the consortium agreement draft, that we recently hit? Please confirm now that you have. Like, I've seen comments from various people, but not from everybody. So, everybody, please confirm, that you have had some chance to, to look at it.",
            "I have, I have looked through.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I haven't seen anything controversial. But I haven't got any feedback from the legal people about it.",
            "Yeah. And, so are you still expecting any?",
            "Well, yeah, mainly because they would be the ones, that have to approve it before it would be signed, so I anything. Our administrative person was on holiday till last week, she's back today. Hopefully, they get some update during in this week.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "So that was the to the controversial. But. Yeah, I'm not the one who has an eye to it.",
            "Yeah. Maybe any any form procedures on everybody's partners side, so. At everybody's, site. So, are there any, like deadlines or or time frames, that everybody expects their legal people to talk about this consortium agreement? So that do we have to agree on some time line? So that by some date, it is a fix document, that you will then show to your legal people and in two weeks from that time, you will get it back, or. Would would such a formal timing be useful, or can we simply go through this today, and everybody will go home with their, with the specific questions. And in two weeks from now, we will join again and, like result the the questions and that would be, that would be it?",
            "I think that sounds fine. I think, Yeah.",
            "Yeah. It sounds fine.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So no formal procedures, timing,, topics or questions raised today. Will be discussed internally at each site in about two weeks from now. We will discuss them and resolve them jointly. Yea, okay. So, thank you for for this confirmation. And then, I, I, my critical question to towards the consortium agreement is, whether the ORGANIZATION2 is signing it or not. And as I've just read from ORGANIZATION2, they're still. Discussing this. Que. It's not a problem for the project, in either case. Because if they are signing the consortium agreement, that means that they will have access to the resources and it would be very easy for them to provide data to the project and and exploit, or like experiment with the, with the results of the project during the project lifetime. So the consortium agreement will make the collaboration easier, a the little bit from the whole point of view. But if they decide not to sign it, they will be covered by us. And I've talked to our legal people, and our legal people said, \"well, that is easy, we will simply prepare two things, probably one memorandum that that like, In broad terms says, that the ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION2 collaborate and then there will be a specific small agreement, that will talk about the data \". So, and and also to the use of of the tools that that we developed here. So that, on basis of this, the just the bilateral agreement between the ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION2. ORGANIZATION2 will be providing the meeting, the meetings, and and the documents to translate and all of that to the to the coordinator and thus to the, to the consortium. And on the other hand, ORGANIZATION2 will be entitled to use the technologies that we developed here for the purposes of projects, for the evaluation, at the Congress. For the ORGANIZATION5 congress and so on. So this is, I do not think it it changes anything from the technical point of view, but it has to be cleared out from the legal point of view. What is easier for ORGANIZATION2 to sign, whether the consortium agreement, or whether they prefer the bilateral binding to us.",
            "Yeah. So if if there any questions or comments or suggestions maybe from the past, you know, what is what is easier than this, let me know. Otherwise, we. Will simply proceed. I will make sure that our legal people talk to ORGANIZATION2 legal people, and they agree in one way, or another.",
            "And and how you think about it agreement, because.",
            "It definitely has to be before the end of the year, sure, yes. Before the project starts. So that time frame is the same.",
            "But the consortium agreement is kind of, it can really be finalised, until, you know.",
            "Well,. So the consortium agreement, cannot be finalised, until the decision is known. So if ORGANIZATION2 is signing consortium agreement, then this is easy, and they will result the things themselves. In that time frame of for the consortium agreement. If ORGANIZATION2 is not signing it, we will mention ORGANIZATION2 and one of the attendances there. That's for the affiliated parties, or whatever. And the the bilateral agreements between ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION2 will be prepared independently of this. And may yeah, this is this, yea. I think that that it should be doable in very few weeks, like two or three weeks. But PERSON4, please confirm, or that your legal people are accessible at this space. Whether you can simply talk to them, and in, you expect them them to be able to sign the bilateral agreement in two weeks from from the point when you ask? So PERSON4? Are you.",
            "Now it looks, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's a double mute feature, I really. It's a bad thing.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "So at least I know.",
            "So?",
            "That means off, okay. Well, it won't be me talking to the rea legal people, it will be PERSON6, and I have no experience with them whatsoever, so? But I think it sounds reasonable but, well. I don't know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, this is something that should be, like clarified quickly. Like, it doesn't have to be.",
            "Done quickly, But it has to be made. We have to be confident, that this is easy to archieve. So please, wheve as soon as you talk to to your boss PERSON6, please, ask about the legal thing. And the sooner we get our legal people talk to your legal people directly, the better. And I think it should happen definitely, well, this week, like today, tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, I agree.",
            "Okay. Yeah, so we will we will proceed along this, and then, we will let everybody know which, what happens. For everybody else, I don't think that, that it affects anything. If we go for the bilateral agreement, then we will probably like, well, it's. Essentially, it is it is up. Cleaned up, and that we can carry out the project. So that we can get the data from you and, and so on. If, yeah. We might ask you for experience. Or if, if any partner, especially ORGANIZATION9, for example, who are still not here, or or ORGANIZATION7, if they feel, that some particular access rights to thing, so some some access to some data or some use of some technology, has to be explicitly mentioned in this agreement, and if it's the bilateral agreement-style, then please, talk to me. So that we make sure that it is explicitly mentioned. So if you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Had concerns, that ORGANIZATION2 might have problems or or, might be slow in probe, In providing something, or if you had concerns about ORGANIZATION2 using ORGANIZATION7 in in some way, or another way, this is something that, that should be clarified in the in the agreement beforehand. And then, that's, let's let's warn about it as soon as you realise. So even if, if there are like flaws in the agreements, we can always create other like further bilateral agreements, for example, between ORGANIZATION7 and ORGANIZATION2 independently, and we can also refine, like update this consortium agreement, and all that. So so it is not as an irreversible thing. If we make an error, we can always fix it. But it's most important to to keep the communication running, and and discuss things and and prim problems, if that's possible. Yeah, I see someone's ringing. Yeah, yeah, okay. So,, yeah, so this is this is. I'm sorry. So I will just add one comment. During this week, ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION2 will make sure their legal people talk to each other and agree in week from now to sign CA or to go for the bilateral a a agreements. Yep, okay, so then, another thing, that we need to discuss, are the various comments and options that we pre-selected in the consortium agreement. And one particle thing, that I just wanted to highlight is, that there is one section on on those like intellectual property topics. And for this one, we have pasted in the module that is aimed for the the software style of intellectual property. All this is essentially a template that was created by ORGANIZATION1 project called PROJECT2 and this PROJECT2 project simply create create a sampled agreement for consortium with some modules and we have selected what we found most appropriate. And. I would suggest to go over the over the consortium agreement now. Like we can either proceed along the comments, or we can proceed top to bottom. Or we can simply do it by silent agreement so that we will open only the comments that everybody remembers they they need to open. So which one do you prefer? Do you prefer go to top to bottom, or go over the comments, or only if anybody is not confident or not not sure about the the the proposed choice, they should speak?",
            "I think, PERSON3, we just kind of go through the whole document, obviously. That thing you just have to, as you said go to the bottom and pick out the things that that you think are.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Interesting for discussion or available as anything else. And between them that you shared.",
            "Yeah yeah. So. Yeah, so I'm going to very quickly scroll through this. And, okay. So this is an important thing. ORGANIZATION7 GmbH. I'll accept this comment right away. Do you want to make a copy first? That's difficult thing. So well, I'll just say to be accepted. Because I want to record the history. So that's why I'm I'm kind of hesitating to accept the the comments right away. So if you spot any any topic that you would like to discuss, please say so. This is all, the comments that I have skipped so far, are related to whether the ORGANIZATION2 is signing or not. And we have discussed this in the past. Someone commented, on the agenda for the form meetings. Whether the the timings, the requirement to send the agenda 14 days before the meeting or 7 days before the extraordinary meeting are reasonable. And, I think we should simply keep it as it is, because this is intended for the formal meetings. It's not for the regular project meetings that will have on, as needed. We will have them much more often than these formal meetings. So, these formal meetings are to discuss whatever the the final financial statements, or if if some party is is not providing what they are supposed to. So for these formal things, I think the the the time, The the specified time minutations are are reasonable, and and they should be there. But it doesn't require us obviously, to say two weeks beforehand whether, when do we want to discuss the the programming language for one partical tool kit or whatever.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that is reasonable. I was afraid that all meetings will be at this this way, that would be horrible.",
            "No, no, no, no.",
            "It would be so. OK.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, we will try to keep the formal meetings to their minimum and the minimum is actually formerly described in this document. I have and I have a an assistant to take care of this, because I'm bad at deadlines myself. And she is surely more reliable than me. So the formal meetings will happen at least once a year, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe it says like ever twice a year, but we won't have plan to have them in person, obviously, we will have them, I think, like every six months remotely. But with the formal agenda sent beforehand. And in the in between, there will be regular meetings, especially as the the deadlines for deliverables, or milestones will be approaching. Yeah, okay, so there is there is, yeah. Simple majority or majority of deals to thirds. We proposed to take things simple, and depending depends on the final six, simple majority is 3 or 4, oh, someone was doing the maths.",
            "I'm gonna I think we shouldn't get hung up on these things. Cuz this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It definetly, it's like a sort of safety net.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, we go off back like this. But. In general, decision should be a consensus.",
            "Yes.",
            "We would really get stuck then.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So it's, it's not important at all, whether it is two thirds or or a majority. Because we first have to agree on on the content. Yeah. So someone asked what, whether this, the the minutes will be sent and then duplicates what if they be like properly signed with something which I don't know at all. It does compliant electronic signature. So I hope not, I hope that we trust ourselves. But if anybody will require us to sign something in some way, I'm sure the ORGANIZATION3 will find a way to sign it. So. Yeah. So I would simply resolve this. Yeah. And then, when I mention the bodies. So the bodies of the project, we have this. What's it. The General Assembly. Where is this.",
            "What was this?",
            "I'm scrolling decisionaly,. Yeah, it's called \"Project Coordination\" committee and in the original describing, it was called the the General Assembly. This is us. This is the the the body, that has every partner represented by one person and one one voice in that. And this is how we are making the especially the formal decisions, such as whether overall party from the consortium and and all these things. We are the the coordinator and we are responsible for the various things. And the project management office will be most likely simply that single assistant of mine, who will like send the. Invitations and all this. We have the user and advisory board. And the that is something which we have specified in the project proposal. And the the user and advisory board will have their meetings with us and it will happen at least once a year, we will present what we are after. And what the project is is doing, and the outside entities, the representatives of them will will tell us whether they like it and that they can find what they see the other ways of exploiting this, or what they would do something better. The people we have for this already, like asked beforehand, are rather interesting, I would say. We have PERSON10 from the ORGANIZATION1, the machine translation at ORGANIZATION1, we also have a person from the Interpreting Department there. They like, they have in the past agreed that they will serve in this board. And one question that I have in in this respect, is whether we want someone from ORGANIZATION6 there as well, or not? Because as you as you might have noticed, ORGANIZATION2 is independently talking to ORGANIZATION6 to provide the the translation and interpreting at the ORGANIZATION5 congress. So there could be this head-to-head competition. And I would always like to make sure that this head-to head competition is only in the scientific terms and not in in person. And never taken in personal terms. So I would call it a friendly competition. And with with that in mind, I see it as as a nice and a potentionaly nice thing to have someone from the ORGANIZATION6 among the user and adviser on board. So this is just my question, whther you would be opposed to this, or whether you would promote that? I don't have any pers. Any particular person in my in my mind on mid on my mind yet. But just in general, since they are our competitors in the comparative project, it's something that should be discussed. So any ideas on, like avoiding the competitors in user-and-advisory board, or or promoting that?",
            "PERSON3? Hello, sorry to be lated.",
            "Yeah, no problem, thank you for joining.",
            "Regarding ORGANIZATION6 joining the board.",
            "Yeah?",
            "Let me ask you - we. The role of ORGANIZATION6 in the advisory board in this case? Because y. In the past, the you know, we put the spirit to PROJECT1 PROJECT1 project then, and we had a reviews from other companies. For example, we had people from the la. Of one of the biggest.",
            "Companies of. So, which would be the role of ORGANIZATION6 in the advisory board. Because I'm a little bit. Confused about how this.",
            "Yeah, yea. So.",
            "Out of presenting to. It's not something what we have to present to the ORGANIZATION1 commission. But.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I see your point, so that that is a very important point that that you have raised.",
            "But even you know, the one way.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I'm not. I'm not sure what the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It sounds odd there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay? So let's. I'll just forget this idea, oh, another way to look at this would be, that potentionally, if the project is successful, they could be the, like the one who buys this technology and then, it, it would be easier to to approach them if they already knew what exactly is behind the scenes and. So it it could be way of exploiting our results by giving them away for some licensing thesis or whatever to to ORGANIZATION6. So that's a but a. Yeah, this may be looking too far away in the future and.",
            "I don't think ORGANIZATION6 have licensed anything, like I guess they always develop it themselves.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. So there is just forget the idea and let's keep the real enthusiasts as our advisory guard. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, it's a question of what we want from this advise guards. Cuz I never quite heard the advisory guards really doing projects.",
            "Yeah, so they're here.",
            "People.",
            "Yeah, we expressively promised in the proposal to talk to the to the users, to the institutions to and try to persuade them to to consider the technology and test it in their particular use cases. So the the, I see this user advisory board mainly as a networking body, so that like we meet with the people, we have, we have a reason to send them an email, and to to send them the details. And if we word the details interestingly, and if the results in the in the presentations to use their advisory board look promising, they will hopefully want to try it out and it will help the dissemination. So I see it mainly as an advertising. Venue. Maybe there are other uses. So they could like the the the. They this, the outspok. This is, this is the the way I see it. The explicitly expressed motivation for this is that they will provide us with use cases, they need to cover and add comments to the way we have like simplified things for us. If this simply. If this simplifications are reasonable, or if their business is slightly different. So it is it is, like, comments on the processes that we have that we have designed and and that we are supporting with our tools. So if they, yeah, so if they don't,, so that I agree with you that we have only very rarely heard commands that like influenced what we do. That have changed our decisions. I see it primarily as the dissemination of the body.",
            "Okay, so you're looking for people who are interested in running multilingual meetings is that the sort of?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "And that's the reason why you gone for the IUS1?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay so this is the user-advisory board. This is. So we have talked about it, because it is the formal body of that, of the project, and, yeah.",
            "But, but also, we should have this body in place.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, exactly. So if you have someone, there is already few names listed in the the description of action. And, This, we will contact these people. If you have other suggestions, please send them to, to me, and we will, will then before inviting the people, we'll let everybody know that we are starting inviting our user advisory board members, this is the current list, if you have anyone to add, if you have anyone to remove, please let us know.",
            "Yeah. So then we have this PROJECT3 data protection officer. And this is someone who we'll have to select someone also very soon. And the foreback is the assistant of mine, who will. Come to full position at the beginning of November, so actually before the project starts. But it could be anybody else as well. It is someone, who simply oversees, how data is handled, and whether GDPR is is done properly within the project. So if you have someone experienced, you can nominate him, that would be useful. This particular assistant of mine is is willing to learn things, but she has little experience with this herself. So if you have experienced people, that might help us. So it could be more persons, it doesn't have to be a single person. And then we will also have to have a Project Ethics Committee. And it will be three or five members, at least half of. Which will be not connected to the to the project. So they will they will be from outside. And the reason for having this ethics committee is to validate the procedures that that we are going to propose. And this is, If you remember, at the beginning of this call, I was saying something like \"remember this call is being recorded for these and these purposes\". So this was very informal and very'ad hoc 'way of of trying to preempt any ethics issues. And we, when doing this at large scale and not within the project, when doing this with the newcomers, with people outside from project, plain users, plain participants in everybody else's meetings. The procedure of handling this has to be simply, like streamlined. It has to be very easy, and very cleal clear, what is happening with the data. So these are the the data handling rules that we will design and write. The assistant of mine is already working on the on the wardings of the of the consens, that people will be signing either by clicking a button or actually when the meeting happens in person or at the site. So the committee is then to validate all these procedures. So if you have someone experienced in in ethics, and and data collection and handling human participants, please let me know, we will have to find very soon people to populate this this board and to so that we have the feedback for our procedures early in the project. Yeah, so, so that is the bodies. And let's scroll down for then in the consortium agreement. It is not scrolling. It is it is zooming, okay. They had just. Went crazy. Yeah, so the financial provisions. Here is, yeah I have no idea, the payments schedule? Yes. So we have selected here that we will not use internal payments, simply. We will, use, this is just simplification of how you receive money and. So we selected an option that seems easier for us. So the coordinator will simply, send, the money to the parties, unless the party is is own or something. In short. If you have any comments, let us know. Yeah, here is this joint ownership and, yeah. So we are again taking a simpler statement. So that if something is created jointly by several parties, every party can exploit the result as it sees fit and grant non-exclusive licenses without any consent consent from other parties who have contributed to this joint result. So it is like it is an two, it is an X with two sides. It can be both useful for each of the party so that they can exploit the result and on the other hand, if if, It will allow everybody else to exploit the results under the same conditions. Yeah, so this is, if you have no problems with this, let's select the easier option. Then, there is this transfer of results, The legal person from our ORGANIZATION3 said, that there is some. So, actually, he he corrected the template, because he he said that there is copyright licences and the ownership. And this wording, the previous wording was limited to just of, to just one form of of the legal ownership of the intellectual right. So so he has improved the wording, I I cannot say anything to this. If you. If you understand the differences, then then let me know, otherwise we'll simply accept what what he has proposed. What else do we have? The dissemination, cooperation, background including. Yes! So the background is very important. In attachment one, the parties have identified and agreed on the background of the project, and have also informed each other that access to specific background is subject to to legal restrictions or limits. Anything not identified in item one,, in attachment one, shall not be the object of access right obligations regarding background. So this background is something that I need everybody to fill in. So please send me the background sections. I'll now, I'll actually show you the background of. Where is that?",
            "That sentence, that you've just courted.",
            "Which one? Anything not identified?",
            "Not identified, it has two negatives in there, so if anything is not identified, it shall not be.",
            "Should not be.",
            "An access right obligations. OK, so that means that if.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So if it is not identified.",
            "So access right. Yeah.",
            "The parties have no right to have access, but yes, as well, but as well what I'm getting at is it. If things are open source.",
            "Yes?",
            "They don't need to specify them at all, because.",
            "Yes. That's right.",
            "Because parties, not having the right to access will have an access to them anyway. So there is no point in it, really.",
            "Yes.",
            "That is my opinion.",
            "Ye.",
            "Right.",
            "So the, the whole idea of of this background is that,.",
            "So the the whole idea of this background is that everybody says, \"Here are my things, my family jewels that you would have to buy from me, because this is the well, the way I do business. But for the purposes of the project, we will need this jointly, and for the purposes of the projects you can use it. So the background is something which is owned of by the particular party, and everybody sees that the project will need it. So the party says, \"Yes, this is the background that I'm bringing into the project for the benefit of the project.\"",
            "Okay.",
            "So, for some reason I haven't received an email that I sent to myself. And I'll open the consortium agreement that worked very well in the past, That's, that's the PROJECT project. And there is background. Just to give you an illustration. So, here is our background section in that. So I need everybody, I need every partner to provide. So this is ORGANIZATION4, where is us? This is us, yeah. So the the form is not that not that critical. There is some table and, so ORGANIZATION4 has filled this table, essentially saying that the software is is open source. And and that is it. So there was the background brought by ORGANIZATION4. We brought in various corpora. To the project. So. This is something which has various licenses, and just to make things simple, we put them into the background, which meant that we are dual licensing them also for the project for free. So we have a repository, so we have various corpora and dictionaries. And we have simply listed them, and we were like, acessive, this list is is an big supse. Big super set of things that were actually needed by the project. But just to make things simpler, we said, \"yes, this is the background that we are bringing in. And if if that was then found in the project useful, and if anybody wanted it from the project, they could simply use it. So this is, yeah. This is, this is it. So I want every partner to somehow specify, what they are bringing into the project. So ORGANIZATION9 should bring in their platform. And ORGANIZATION7 should bring in the the infrastructure. The the the the ORGANIZATION7's service. And you need to specify it in some way, which is like, which makes sense both to you and us.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so for us, this is generally easy, because we develop tools, and we develop, like data, and then we list all the tools and the data. And all of them are. Or all of them do have some, like public presents. They have UIL that describes them. So you don't have. PROJECT1 are all the describes the ORGANIZATION7 software that you are bringing. So you will have to describe it in words, so simply describe what what you are providing for the project, and please do this preferably in the draft version, by the end of this week, or in a week from now. It is not very complex. PROJECT1 know what. Half of page, or at least at most a page of text.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Or maybe just a single item. Like a simple item could be also fine. If if you can describe the the jewel very concisely, it's perfect as well, so to get this, there is a template for this attachment. It's at the end, so simply make a copy, so this will be found on page 17, the background is, this is the signatures, this is the background. So simply, copy this, take part in one and you can do it directly in this document or you can do it elsewhere separately and send it to me by e-mail. In the end, it will all end in the same document, and it will be a part of the consortium agreement signed by everybody. So the, I do not see any prob, like anything what is better for us. It is always better to to include more in the background, then less, because if you include more then it would be easier to use it within the project. If you include less, and then we find it necessary to use one more item in the project, then we will have to update this, or like, talk about this with special. Special arrangements. If you if you are able to include things up front, it is better. And also anything that's part of the background is obviously not result of the project. So this is something, that like nobody can say, \"well, we have contributed to your, we have we have improved your if if you have provided it in the background.\" Yeah, so please, everybody, send me your background descriptions, Preferably during this week. Okay so this was page yeah page 17. So that's the access rights, that's the backglound. Here is the general principles that describe that. Yeah, and here is access rights for exploitation. So, yeah. So here we have suggestion from PERSON7 to preffer. Option 1. So this is the two options. So so the option one, that we have discarded in, or we have proposed to discard was \"access rights to results if needed for exploitation of a party's own results, should be granted on the fair and reasonable conditions, access rights to results for internal research activities shall be granted on royalty-free basis.\" So this means, that if my machine transmitting translation system depends on the ORGANIZATION8 ASR, and I want to to use the the ORGANIZATION8 ASR, then, I will have to talk to ORGANIZATION8 and make it fair and reasonable. Option 2 was that if I need to present my machine translation system, that depends on the ORGANIZATION8 ASR, ORGANIZATION8 should give me the, Like not the sources of the system, but the the way of some running or operational-functional form of that on royalty-free basis. So our. Idea was to'let's make things simpler and let's, let's simply expect everybody to provide support to other parties' results on royalty-free basis. But PERSON7 preffers option 1. So what is, what are other people's options? I'm we are probably fine with the option one.",
            "I would also prefer option one, I don't think that option two is reasonable.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because providing the things like separate, providing a service that wants the ASR from implies costs. So that might cost us something.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "That's an unreasonable option to to use both these.",
            "I have the one. Yeah, yea. The royalty-free basis probably means, that we would have to pay these costs, but you would not charge as anything extra. That is my understanding of royalty-free. So I'm probably fine with option one as well. So let's. Yeah. So, We will switch to option one. Yeah, okay. So this will actually this will actually be, sorry, I did not want this, I want to suggest this, such this thing. So so option two will be deleted. Okay. Yep. So thanks for this comment. I think this is, this is exactly what we have to, like consider, and and and discuss. And I'm happy to see an an update. Yeah, okay. So, then the entities that's related to if ORGANIZATION2 is signing or not. Then. In the yeah. There is this. This something that I do not understand, actually. Additional access rights. I do not know, if you understand this. For the evidence of doubt and grown to access rights, not covered by the ground agreement for has shown you did. So, this is what we have selected there, and the other option. Yeah, that's it. The party has agreed to negotiate in good faith. And any additional access Rights uses results as might be asked for by any party upon adequate financial conditions to be agreed. Okay, so I do not understand the the differences. So I selected option one.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'm not lawyer, but I I believe the difference between option one and option two is that option one, you can always say. And the option two says:",
            "So I would also prefer option one.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so.",
            "If I think, I mean in under consortium, we will always be able to negotiate a good pay and other reasonable terms. But not.",
            "Yeah. So maybe this is one thing that you might want to ask your legal people, if they have any opinion on this. Otherwise, if you do not ask, or if if they don't say anything bad, we will go with the option one, whatever that means. Okay, thank you. And then just refines the access rights to software, separating the access rights to the source versus the access rights to the service that the software provides. And, well, it was, like standard legal legalise, I did not have any comments to this. So hopefully, it regulates things in a reasonable way. So then there is this non-disclosure information and. Whatever. And that's that's not, that is like essentially an NDA among our. And then we have various things here, and we have, yeah. So there is a settlement of dispute. Yeah. The important sentence is here: \"The parties shall endeavour to settle their disputes amicably.\" So this is what what essentially. What essentially we we hope will happen. And first of all, we hope, that there won't be any any real disputes. And we have selected, un. Less you have other options, we have selected option one: \"we mediation\" of not one-one, but one-two. Yeah. So this is this is what our lawyers have recommended. They have suggested to extend some of the days and they suggested to remove the specific words here, from this line and leaving there just the \"The case shall be brought to court\", which means it should be brought to the respective court of wherever they them is handling, has happened. So if, if.",
            "One, one comment. He because I have also see up there you have replaced to threads.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So I am happened, but I'm pretty sure my legal department always is not very willing to accept anything but LOCATION1 law, because they say that \"if\"",
            "Okay.",
            "\"if something happens, they would have to get a lawyer in the PERSON7. And they couldn't say anything on it and etc, etc. \" So usually, the compromise, they settle on this LOCATION1 law.",
            "So ORGANIZATION8 also prefers.",
            "It also depends what the other legal department.",
            "LOCATION2, yeah.",
            "I would imagine our legal department would prefer LOCATION2. I can't really speak for them, but then, we have, I have seen other, to the Belgian law, by is okay.",
            "And. Hey, I know that the second sentence should be OTHER1. So hopefully that, that will make things easier. So, in in general, I think we'll, we'll probably say say yes to to LOCATION2. I will ask again our legal people. If if there is a strong reason for us to to demand LOCATION3. But I do not think they will be strong enough to to, like. Outweigh the the preferences of the three of you, or or perhaps more. So this will. This will this will very likely be reverted to LOCATION2. Yeah. So sorry, sorry that I first missed this point. I knew that was there, but I just scrolled too far away. Okay, so that's the, that's the place. And then, here is the selection of of the mediator. So I have nothing to to say about this. The legal people told me that I see it as expensive for whatever. And if you don't have any preferences, if your legal people are fine with with these, then we will accept the comments as, except the suggestions and remove option two as suggested. So please, if if you have concerns about this, please, talk to your legal people and have them comment on this. Otherwise, we will we will simply accept this. And there is, if you know, in the grand agreement, there is section 29.1.. And this section demands to notify everybody 45 days before disseminating and in the result that, this is going to happen. And we have found in the past, that the for scientific papers, there is no way you have your paper ready 45 days before the submission deadline to show it to your partners and ask for permission to publish it. So our legal person has proposed this particle wording, which says, \"this obligation for the 45 days is not needed, unless you would be disseminating a result that we wanted to have patented\". So for things that parties in general do not wish to obtain patent protection, or which cannot be patented anyway, because of the way the patent, patent system works. There is no obligation to announce it beforehand.",
            "But how do we know it could be patented?",
            "Yeah, ye, I know, I know. So if you are, if you have concerns, then notify us. And and it's.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So if you are not sure whether you, whether someone who was going to patent something, Then it's better to to follow the instructions in section 1, 29.1. But if you are like confident, that no one is patenting anything, or if, like just from the talking to the people or if your lawyers are confident that this cannot be patented, then, well in in, Yeah, it's all it is all unclear and soft. Obviously.",
            "I mean, you know. I mean, I totally agree that this 45 day rule is is is impractical. And you know, when sees his rules.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yea. I mean, I'm happy to. I mean, we can circulate a copy of a paper as it is submitted. Yeah. This is quite practical to do an made use. They have 45 days. But you must meet 45 days before submittion, before publication. I mean, either way becomes. It is kind of difficult.",
            "It's kind of difficult in any case. Because then you would have to check whether the with the the the some of the Governor of the deadline is 45 days from the submittion deadline, or something like that. So yeah.",
            "So that I mean, does that I mean, OK. I mean if this, if this is OK, then, I would leave it as it is and yeah.",
            "We can say, that we have done it, because we knew that no one would be patenting anything. So let put put the other way round. If anyone from you would have the the desire to do some software patents or whatever, please make sure that everybody in the project kind of knows this. So that you are interested in patenting things, because then, special precautions have to be made. And remember, it is always like everybody is, There is no way that you could patent other party's results. You could be only patenting your own results. So the, this is the the this is like the to prevent one party disclosing something about other party's results. So this is also like general sanity thing. It is - do not disclose other people's results. And then you are safe.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. So then there is just the signatures. And after the signatures, there is the background information. So it's yeah. Background needed from every partner, preferably by the end of the week. At the end of the week in some draft form. Yeah, someone cleverly asked about the Kickoff date and location. Our preference will be LOCATION3, early January, between 10th and 23rd. If you have any strong opinions against this, or if you would like to coordinate this Kickoff with other projects Kickoff, please, let us know. But otherwise we will proceed with this tentative plan and we will send the do-to poll soon and, like book. Like so everybody can book the dates and we will find the reasonable dates to do the poll and and all that.",
            "Yeah, so I will have to go to at least one other kickoff, perhaps more. So that's why.",
            "Yes.",
            "That's why I'm asking.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the dates and locations are whatever expected, so I'll just say that, you know it's me to organise if a letter comes early, then they will get the data, and everything else would have fit in around it. It is good I mean.",
            "Yeah, I see, yeah, yeah. Okay. So we should send the do-to polls soon. And make.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will have to leave rather soon, unfortunately, so there is this, this other comment not directly related to the to the consortium agreement, but in a way, there is a link as well, because the consortium agreement like, controls, how the data is is used. And so, so who has entered data generated for ourselves?",
            "Excuse me, excuse me, I mean, yeah.",
            "Huh?",
            "Alright, that might be. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Maybe, PERSON7 could write aspect about a new one out of appointments for us and our developers?",
            "Yes. So this, this is what I wanted to suggest. That you two talk directly and all the technical things.",
            "Yeah we wrote, PERSON7, are you still here? Can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Because I asked.",
            "Yes.",
            "Maybe you can answer our last email so we can make a new app. Appointment, yes?",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay, thanks, perfect.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So unless there are any other comments or questions? I would like to thank you very much for the preparations and for this productive meeting. So remember, talk to your legal people. If if they had any concerns about the consortium agreement, they should say it now, because in a at most two weeks from now, we will finalise this by clicking yes yes yes yes yes to all these, or to do these to do these sugg. These suggestions that we have just walked through. So, thank you very much for joining.",
            "Thank you.",
            "And.",

So if you have something on me so please say so at the beginning and otherwise I'll just leave you in the call. I see that the hairdressers are not closed in in LOCATION1, which is great because there are like one of the anticovid regulations that all the hairdressers are down. So you have to go somewhere like under the cover of the night but actually than I leaving out your flat at night it also forbiden. So -.",
            "I should just ask my, I just ask my girlfriend to cut my hair and.",
            "Yeah, exactly that's the holy option.",
            "You can you can see it on my beard that they are closed.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay, so if there is not anything urgent on me, than that's great and yeah. I'll I'll just to my other unfinished task. Okay, it was great to see you for this single minute and thanks. And, well. We will be in touch. Thank you. Bye, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Hello PERSON2. You just missed PERSON5. Like for a second.",
            "Hi everyone.",
            "Hi.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah we can hear you. Okay. And I just said up you missed PERSON5. Because he just left.",
            "And he's not going to join?",
            "Well, he always joins for like 2 minutes. And then goes left.",
            "Was it. Okay. And,, let's start. I've see like TED's quite large number right? You you have edit 2600.",
            "Yeah. 10 times more from the last time.",
            "No no no. It's like -.",
            "It's a it's a significant improve. Okay. And I don't know how they could these many people to join. But last minute they just did some big campaign, I don't know. But we are we are happy they do this.",
            "It's like 1000 more than we had for 2 weeks, for last 2 weeks, yeah.",
            "Okay. That sounds great. So what we need to do now is to evaluate the translation quality, right?",
            "It's it's just so like I distributed it yesterday and I'll ask the people to hopefully to annotate it till Thursday. These Thursday. But. Yeah. We will be happy if they annotate as much as possible,, until the deadline.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's the 23rd of November.",
            "Um-hum. Okay, so, yeah, if we evaluated now we can definitely mix some conclusions, right? About it.",
            "Or, well, enough. It's sort of can or leave it, but the more the better.",
            "It will be more accurate, right? So. Yeah, that's great. Okay. Is there anything else for PROJECT1? Probably not, right? Or -.",
            "So we are together with, we are just coordinating with PERSON3 and working on it. And, yes, so. Gone.",
            "Whether I should tell all the other paper stop writing there sections? Now or later? Because there section -.",
            "Yeah, maybe you can, you can just poke them. Or I can poke them.",
            "No, it's okay. I guess just ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION4. And. Oh, we should get, we should get -.",
            "ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION2 primarily from ORGANIZATION4 it's, I think there will just explain how many annotators they have and it's their profile.",
            "Yeah. Well, I guess we should get some data from ORGANIZATION2 from quarterbacks.",
            "Yes, the additional one. Because we've been sent if after the first -.",
            "But it's some time ago.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's some time ago.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so, I guess we can move move on to ORGANIZATION3, right. So, PERSON6, you already were doing there some results last week. So we expected -.",
            "Yes. So, now I'm running, okay, so, just after after after our meeting, we have discussion with PERSON4.",
            "And, so we decided that I should run the fine-tuning from the -. Because I I ran the pretraining till the 70, 750 000 iterations. And so we decided that let's run the fine-tuning from that last point of the last check point. So run for for every setting for every like configuration of training data. I ran the fine-tuning from the same spot.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And yes, so it is so almost finished. And the numbers are really similar to the numbers from fine fine-tuning, from the previous numbers of fine-tuning. And we have to discuss it with PERSON4, again. And what else. I asked him or or we discussed that the we should maybe try this approach on the other language. So he decided to tried on German. So now he is working on German zero. And yeah. Since the results are, okay -. The results are fine, but they are not like like excellent or something like that. And we still think that it should be proved, prove on the other languages. So that's why we maybe postpone it for either, for so for some workshop. EMT or WMT or something like this. Not for Naco.",
            "Well, as you mentioned one one option is to tried, nor equiting for another language, or maybe doing some more like the in that analysis of the difference in the translations, but that might be a little bit costly, so -. And I, myself I can have no exact idea right now. How it should be different. Or like, what to to what to what should be be, what should do try to investigate there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay, like like the standards approach with B and to just sample some of the sentences compare language difference. But most probably we wouldn't find like some consistence, consistant difference, and, yeah.",
            "So with the, with the top set ups there is only like half point, half point difference, right?",
            "Yeah, this.",
            "So, well, what you can try is doing some diff between the two hard like list of hypotheses from both systems or multiple systems. You compare and just see how many or how much how many how many sentences are same, like produced by systems and in how many sentences they differ. And just to go a quick glance on it. I rule and it's -. And what else can we done.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so, so that's some ideas.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's definitely something what to to we we we will like in the end, we will add like such an analysis to the to the paper.",
            "Okay.",
            "But stil we are we are not sure whether the change or whether the improvement this consistant -. So that's why we are also run try to done another language.",
            "Okay.",
            "Whether whether we yeah, yeah. Yeah in the consistancy of of of the improvement.",
            "Okay. Yeah, that's so fine.",
            "I also want to try to train that's what we discussed last time to try. I will run it today hopefully try to round the training different random seed.",
            "And just to find weather is weather is not just the random change that we observed.",
            "Hopefully not but yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that might take another week or two, right? Or?",
            "Yeah, but since we are not aiming for the Naco deadline.",
            "Yeah, that's fine, just just to get some some estimates like -. Okay. So, I guess we can move to that list of negation, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So, updates job for even PERSON7 can can ship in, later -.",
            "Yeah,.",
            "Okay, so first, oh sorry. So, first of all, yeah, I'm sorry I still haven't look at the data so I need to check that. Hopefully, hopefully tomorrow. But yeah, go on.",
            "Yeah, actually, so,, we have to adds list to my site I was trying to create systematized constraints into the results. And now we have we have generated sentences constraints, and so. And as you can see it it didn't improved the the results, the blue score, list. So, the second, second approach, we were we were trying to to, oh sorry, at the same number because to to combined constraint from different references. And those are nearly the way of, ways of combining them so I was trying to to make it. And now it working a bit. So am am we are using that idea that since we have you one alignment of references, with the English. One so we can use constraints from different references avoiding constraints with with similar meaning, right? So -.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "I will have a few that combine them.",
            "I didn't used,, I didn't truth length them for ready this combined constraints. So, I would I would do this. I was spending my time on on reading of combine them, final raise of combined them. So, yeah, I'm I'm really -. It was a process. And sorry about that.",
            "Oh, you you were busy last week about visa. So it's -.",
            "Yeah, I quit I quit had but that's that's that's like -.",
            "Yeah, it's alright. Just to make sure, you also submit results of the word alignment, right? I can I can checked -.",
            "Yeah, you checked it already. And you told me it was okay.",
            "Oh, did I? I remove and checking it from the surface forms without the tokenisation. And that was problematic but I didn't check the new ones. I can login to them.",
            "Okay, I can send you -.",
            "Yeah, definitely. If can I, if I can ask you. Thanks.",
            "Sure. So, we can have, now we can have we can have the results for the -.",
            "Sorry, sorry, I just, I just have some good annotated alignments of 10 sentences, just to like -.",
            "Oh, we can evaluated automatically.",
            "Evaluated only. It's very small, but just the check whether it doesn't do anything crazy.",
            "So, so, just just just to -. Like explain to PERSON6, the problem was that anything there was no tokenisation on the English side. So, words -.",
            "I fixed that.",
            "Connected to the, yeah, connected to the punctuation incorrectly align. So then we didn't proper preprocessing and rewrite it. But I haven't check that yet. Yeah. I just want to make sure -. Yeah, yeah.",
            "If you need need it just tell me because I annotated it of in spring when I tested those several settings of fast align. So, the lemmatise version, version and if we train it from the scratch and or if we pretrain it run it pretrain. So, that s why I need it just to try. It's very small just 10 sentences but -.",
            "Yeah, we can check using using the set.",
            "So maybe maybe we can also sends connect to the PERSON6 if he has time. Like the, the idea is that just not necessary to evaluate it all. But to take a glance on it and see whether is an some not problem with the model but problem with people or something like that can be easily fixed.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I was checking myself so far but I will send you and you can move from that. Okay. And part of that was work which we have to discuss. At least discuss the paper is fan but this is this is not for this meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But,, using this work the idea for the negative constraint. And PROJECT5, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah. We can also still still add, I will see PERSON5 hopefully tomorrow at the office, in the office so I can ask him whether we can have a discussion this week and more detail since we can couldn't do it last week. But sorry.",
            "Well, I I did the implementation part PROJECT5 for the constraint decoding for the negative part,, with different types of containers for the constraints. I evaluated constraints only one subboard then sub multiple subboards but stop in the lays and erase and multiple subboards but stop in the prestructures. Yeah, with differences not but date but yeah the treat work the best for the few conotaces. So, yeah, it was for implementing I guess.",
            "Okay.",
            "To work. So, yeah. I've 2 scenarios. One, first one is to for paraphrase generation. So the negative constraint was the negative constraint was sentence generated by the system without the constraints. So that new sentence is different. So all the tokens that were generated by the system without the constraint are used as a negative constraint. That's, this is first used case to generate paraphrases. And then the second one is to simulate the use case that we want to improve improve the output of the system. So, I also use the tokens generated by the system without the constraints. But only use the tokens that are not in any of the part of the references.",
            "Okay.",
            "So they are like wrong tokens, probably. And, yeah. It also helps like pure blue points. So, I guess it works. But I didn't have nothing to compare it with.",
            "So, so just to make if I understand correctly. The paraphrase generation is not translation. Is just -.",
            "No, it is translation. But you you use the previous like the original translation you use the whole translation as a constraint.",
            "Oh, okay, okay. So we sort translate, okay, okay.",
            "I use all the tokens like lots of boards. I tried using all the subboards as a constraint, or when I implemented a multiple constraints I'm using the whole tokens like march subboards. Yeah, that's the that's the first use case. And the second one is the only difference is that I only use the part of the original output of the system that were not in,, like 80 percent of the references tokens.",
            "So that I only end up with tokens that are probably wrong. Yeah, and it does have like I got got will like from 11 to 13. So that's not bad I guess.",
            "Oh, yeah, that sounds interesting. If we we agree on date this week for discussion. Like if I could ask you to a put it in some table or or.",
            "Sure, yeah, yeah. Also now I'm working on the on the things from the paper of the constraints. But. Yeah. I just found out that the way I'm generating the constraints. The the factors. Or what take about two weeks. So having to, having to modify the script. And then I need to do some modifications for PROJECT5, because, the in the implementation all the factors have different, vocabularies different, ambling mattresses, and in this case, we need to all the factors to have the same on the bidding and bidding, I guess. Because the factors are also subboards from the single vocabulary. So -.",
            "That should be easy to do. Okay, so once I have the data set ready, under training and -.",
            "Okay, okay, that sounds good. Yeah. Again like I would like to looking to the results more to just and it prophane.",
            "Sure, sure, sure.",
            "It's looks promising we can also reported to PERSON9 next meeting and start discussion the the deployment. Yeah, deployment itself. So so we have at least preliminary system or at the last result that we can final.",
            "Even like the the simplest approach works that you just mask out the subboards that you want to not to generate, and that also have what you have constraints but yeah if you go implemented for probably helps of a little bit more, it seems so.",
            "Okay, that sounds great, because that would that would definitely may get burk next year less stressful. Like even don't we -. But we can later focus only on the paper, right, the resurge itself. Because we would have at least something, as as a back up or something like that. That sounds great. I think PERSON5 will probably also have people. Yeah, okay, so. Yeah, I think we can we can cut it short today, right? Or is there anything else? Yeah. Okay, I can mention, but think I've already told you, PERSON8. Like we will start discussing the plan the case moment get you reply for the visa from the embassy. And -.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it doesn't make sense to discuss it before that. And again, like it shouldn't be such a problem even if you arrive after New year. Like, obviously some people won't be completely happy but it won't be disaster. So, yeah. You can, you can definitely resolve that. Yeah, so. From me, there is not much new again. I hope that I'll be still working on ORGANIZATION3 more after the any any deadline. And, yeah. And I still have to claim PERSON1 about the details. But hopefully I will be able to do it this week, so. Questions or something else I forgot? Okay, so, I'll take it that we can we can and that here for for this week. So nice was I seeing you. See you next week.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye bye."

            "Ok..",
            "I I I think we can.",
            "Ok so so we can I can I can try I can try writing them like tonight or tomorrow what's going on.",
            "Because from what I remember, we discussed the issues and we like ended up the conversation and the last thing they said to us was like we'll see or.",
            "I think I think we approved everything that is everything is ready for for launch. And like I think my last mail when PERSON5 asked me whether he should launch it, I I I told him that yes. That it's ready. So I I don't know what's going on.",
            "Okay, hi everyone.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi, PERSON9.",
            "Okay, w. Ok, so I see PERSON3 joined us for the first time, so let me introduce him, or he's he should introduce himself. He will be working with us since starting October.",
            "Yeah, right, from October.",
            "Okay.",
            "Hi everybody. Well.",
            "Hey.",
            "I guess I'll be working on some PROJECT4 related stuffs since I have some experience with that, with multi-source models and implementation of different types of attention and so on and that's probably where I start. And then we will see.",
            "Yeah, definitely, that's a good start. We will discuss it in more detail like at the end of September, like for the time being it's good to have you here. And you can get some general idea, how.",
            "Sure.",
            "How we are working on the project, so yeah. I okay, I will take some notes first. Okay, so first of all, let's take care of the administrative business. Both PERSON3 and PERSON2 still need to get access to the project GitHub.",
            "So I will send e-mail to PERSON6 and include you to the copy and basically, I think the only thing you need to do is send him your login and SSH key to get the access.",
            "Okay.",
            "Or he will tell you if if there is anything else..",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "So other than that, I don't think there's anything like administrative in general, so let's jump into it. We discussed with PERSON11 our last week, I think there is no progress, right? At least on PERSON11's part.",
            "You mean since then?",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Like I started like training some of the systems. Yeah and I'm downloading the data for man monolingual data to get the back translations.",
            "So this is like maybe information just for you, because you are like you have an inside on what I'm doing and.",
            "T no no progress so far?",
            "Not yet, no.",
            "Okay, that's good. So I I didn't look at the bank yet, so that's f update from me.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I've already heard something about PROJECT6. We are waiting for ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "Yea. I'm I will write them tonight or like after the call, what's going on, because yeah last discussion, the last discussion we had was on 19th of August. And yeah, on 18 18th of August I told PERSON5 that he should launch it and then he just together with PERSON12, they just changed some e-mails, like technical e-mails, and then the last e-mail from PERSON5 was OK. So I guess he's starting, but PERSON12 is saying that there is nothing in logs or only one user.",
            "Or is is possible they started, but nobody joined.",
            "Yeah. I I I have to ask them to whether they started or not.",
            "Yeah, it's definitely good to get some update, right. So.",
            "Yes.",
            "What other than that you're you're currently just waiting, right? You don't have anything to do on this part of the project, right?",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, so just.",
            "Or I'm.",
            "So just.",
            "Yeah, I I think like the we have to collect the data.",
            "And that's like, what ORGANIZATION1 has or should start.",
            "So.",
            "And then then we can process the data.",
            "Okay so.",
            "Second stage of annotation and yeah and then.",
            "So technically,, technically, do we have a possible plan B? Like, you know, in case they again like will be too late with starting their part, like I don't know, can we bother our annotators again? Like like last time? Or is it is it not possible this time?",
            "I don't know like,. Because we have already used our annotators.",
            "For like for and yeah. For like PERSON12 collected those statistics and he already used it in the paper and like it's not enough people. You know, so.",
            "Oh yeah, okay.",
            "And some of them and some of them know some Czech, so it's problematic and yeah.",
            "So so we have some small statistics that from this from this data. But if I know it correctly, everything like what is interesting in those data that it it was published or is going to be published in the PROJECT5 article.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or paper by me or PERSON12 and me.",
            "Okay. I don't know, maybe PERSON12 is planning to use ORGANIZATION4 or or some platform for this or? Do you know the details? Or do they have physical like some people from from their university to do the annotations?",
            "They have a they have some they have a list of people that do like share those links or or like among them. And if they successfully finish all the stimuli, they are they will be given a voucher for ORGANIZATION5 or I don't know, something like this. So they are not paid directly, but through those vouchers.",
            "Because we.",
            "We objected that the beginning that is is not that the parts not gonna be paid and they have some issues with that, because of coronavirus, with employing new new people and then they somehow figure out this solution with the vouchers.",
            "Yeah, so so. Because the thing is that well there's the deadline for ORGANIZATION3, right?",
            "Yeah, I know.",
            "And.",
            "I told them I told them that we would like to have all the all the data collectek collected till the end of August. But since I think it it hasn't started yet. So I'm a bit doubtful about it.",
            "T well there's a chance to submit it for later conference, right? But.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also we're not pressured by the project itself, so so technically it's not such disaster. But yeah, I can imagine that we want to like draw the line behind the this part, like finish it completely, right?",
            "Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Because this is like very long long-lasting project, this paper and PROJECT6, so I would also like to have it finished.",
            "Yeah, okay, so so let's focus on yeah, pushing the word in during their part. Which reminds me I didn't ask if PERSON6 was planning to do a meeting this week or next week, but there is still no, there was still no decision for the date, right?",
            "Okay, I didn't I haven't me s noticed it.",
            "I think it went to the official mailing list. There was a call.",
            "Okay.",
            "Then I think.",
            "Okay, they for a new meeting the new. You mean this one, yeah?",
            "Yes. Well, yeah, definitely. But this is not regular schedule, this is like for the next one discuss maybe other dates, I don't know. But it seems that it will be next Thursday, so.",
            "But I guess it's good idea to to also mention it on on this this meeting. It might be.",
            "That what to mention on this meeting? You mean that this meeting with.",
            "Just just, well this will be meeting like the regular meeting with the partners, right? But.",
            "Yeah yeah.",
            "Nice to mention meeting like call right? It will be good to mention it there, that we are waiting for the ORGANIZATION1. A or maybe ask them what's.",
            "Okay, okay. Okay, I see. Yeah. Yeah yeah, so I definitely ask them today what's going on, because like last email which we had from them was from last Wednesday, okay? So then I have two days of vacation, so I didn't like solve anything. So, yeah, I can now ask h ask them what's the progress. And I think they will started definitely by the like this week. There is no reason why they shouldn't.",
            "Okay. Yeah, but yeah again.",
            "I I will I have to prompt th I prompt them and I will, so.",
            "Yeah, good. So I think the last thing is and best is navigation. So PERSON2, did you did you think thought about the problem?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, good.",
            "Which yes. So first of all I'd like to discuss something, that I was thinking while reading the the description of the task.",
            "So. And, correct me if I'm wrong. But I understood that we are we will provide to the user a list of paraphrases and variations of sentence of the sentence of the translated sentence to the user decide something decide which is better and or or something. But in this task, we are assuming that the user doesn't know the target language, right? So, I maybe this maybe I understanding this in a wrong way, but if the the the user doesn't understand the target language, how can he select the best option? So.",
            "So.",
            "Oh I I so I thought in a solution to that. But I I need to know if this is exactly what the task means. Providing the user and best list, right, of of variations of of the translation, paraphrases. Is it correct?",
            "So basically I think there are two options. Like, we can, implement both positive and negative constraints. Like positive constraints might be for example that user can definitely see if if some of the named entities are not translated correctly, right? Even though he doesn't understand the target language. So, he can't basically hard and force these constraints like we I need these words to be translated literally. And that would be the positive constraint, right? And that would be constraint on translation in this case.",
            "Yeah oh.",
            "And that's one of.",
            "Yeah I'm sorry just maybe to maybe just to extend what you are saying.",
            "And this can be this can be like in the target language, e any even though that the user doesn't understand, he can understand some bits of it. Like f for instance, named entities. And he can enforce the the named entities are exactly the same as he knows them in his language or like you know, like name of person or something that it's not screwed up. So this is one thing that can be a positive constraint in the target language that the user cannot understand. Okay, so continue PERSON9, sorry to interrupt you.",
            "Yes. So so obviously it the the positive constrains can be enforced in other scenarios, but let's say, the other option is that since we have a module for paraphrasing, we can try to offer user well we offer user different paraphrases and this might be like. I don't know if we can directly implement the negative constraints or constraining in itself. But the idea with paraphrasing is that when we generate the paraphrases, let's say for example by back translating the target sentence, we can constrain the decoder in a way that that the produced list from the decoder will be more vari well varied than than the default one, right?",
            "Oh, hi, I understand but I I was thinking that if we're providing this. I understand that the constraints would would help and and more examples of the. But I I the point is, we're providing the the end the the this list of paraphrases in the target language. This is the point. Is it correct, right? This is correct?",
            "No or like.",
            "We are providing from the back translation that's so this is variations of the input, just.",
            "Variations of the input, so so the source language.",
            "Okay okay.",
            "Like paraphrases are in the source language.",
            "That was my problem, because I wasn't I I was understanding it wrong, because I thought okay maybe this is in the target language and the user won't understand. So something that I thought about it,, was can you provide discord to this paraphrases? Or something that shows to the user that oh oh this using this k type of a range, of words, or or can be helpful to the translation? Or or something? Like this? Because so if if he doesn't know what is happening inside of the this translation, we need to do some hints about it and with you talk about estimation methods in the description of the task and I think that this could help but to decide the best ones or or or give ideas about using some words or s or other stuff to the user to decide what to select.",
            "This was something that we have somehow already finished doing. It was the source complexity task and. And in this task we were about to provide the user with like h or highlight the words that are prone to error in the translation. And yeah, okay we haven't like in the end, we used a system called the estimation system, that was implemented by ORGANIZATION8 guys, so yeah, definitely some more research would be great for in in this area or in this aspect, but we have already finished this task.",
            "Okay, no problem.",
            "So we are not needed to continue in it till. But but if we can cast the this PROJECT3 in a way that it fits or or ol the other way around, cast this scoring or something in a way that it fits the PROJECT3, so then it's should be okay. It's all about the presentation.",
            "Well but this is just an idea, actually. What we have to do is to finish PERSON1's implementation, right? Of of he he's implementing approach, right? So maybe we can finish and see what happens and and and then think about alternatives. I was. I have a question also I regarding the negative constraints. Do you guys think this would be useful in in some way? Cause I I I thought I I found an approach. I'm sorry about the noises, my the street is a mess, but. Regarding these negative constraints, I I I actually I have found I found an approach that uses I don't know if you know PERSON10 transformer? To to create constrain to apply constraints but just the positive ones. Not the negative ones. We could try this one also, because it seems to be faster and it seems to have good results, but I I didn't investigate it. But I I'm just asking about the negative constraints. Because the positive ones I understand that the person is is selecting the named entities that he wants to remain in the the the translation. But what about the negative ones? I'm sorry, I'm taking too long to explain myself, but.",
            "No, that's alright. Well negative ones, I can imagine like if it's a single token, like that can be implemented quite easily, just by disabling or not disabling, unmasking, masking the word in a open dictionary, therefore the word will never be outputed by the system. I guess it might be little bit trickier when you disable a certain phrase, or like an list of not list of tokens, sequence of tokens. Because you might again only want to restrict the system to output the exact sequence of tokens, but still want to be able output the tokens separately in different context, I guess, but yeah, okay. The fact is that if you think that we will not need the negative constraining, we we can definitely not focus on it. Like that's that was just one of the ideas, or one of the let's say methods or approaches we could take.",
            "Maybe just if I can step in.",
            "You are asking for the implementation? Or how to implement it? Or what is the purpose of negative constraints?",
            "Actually, the general purpose of of. No, no the negative I understand the negative constraints, the idea of not using a certain word or phrase.",
            "But.",
            "How to implement it, or?",
            "Oh how to implement yeah.",
            "Or what was your question?",
            "Actually, the the the need to this implementation, because in this specific task. If people. But it this this is not a problem.",
            "Okay, so so you are asking for purpose in this pec specific task.",
            "Yeah, in this specific task. Yeah.",
            "Because the the the user is given us input a text that he wants to be translated. Why. But but this is just I'm just thinking aloud about the the the task maybe, I should still like the things.",
            "Okay, Just one possible purpose is that okay if we imagine that this use case that the translation system or the PROJECT3 or this constraint decoding be going from let's say English to Czech. And you will see a Czech word that you certainly know from some cues that shouldn't be there, so you can put a negative constraint.",
            "Yeah, constraint.",
            "On this word, yeah?",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah.",
            "And, yeah. And maybe the other thing that PERSON9 hasn't mentioned is that okay, this is a big complicated. But it can go translation or this constraint PROJECT3 can go to the third language.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The language that the user user knows.",
            "Maybe knows.",
            "And maybe is close to the target language or something and or it's easier from the this third language to translate to the target language and he can select those lists in this third language. But yeah I see that it's a bit complications with everything and it's like.",
            "Yeah, there's no problem of having. Sorry, sorry.",
            "Yeah yeah, we don't know whether it it it doesn't be too overwhelming for the user and like too complicated and with not such a benefit for it, yeah. So we don't know whether it's worth doing such a thing.",
            "Yeah yeah ye just thinking thinking out loud. Because it was I was thinking about the task and asking myself about this situation or the pro possible situations so. W ba regarding the third language, we have to. We can give this option to the user, right? Oh, select a language that you understand from this list. And maybe it could help, right? So the the remaining question about it is about the let's say what makes the user to s to change its input, given the PROJECT3? Because let's say I'm changing my input to improve the translation and I'm seeing the bar paraphrases that are are are the system are showing, the system is showing, and but what makes me ensure, have the confidence that I am proving the translation? You know?",
            "That's that's one thing that we are we want to test in this experiment, because we are trying to test there three components. One is back translation, the other one is paraphrasing through pivot languages and third one is the the quality estimation. And like we we like we have we are going to test it what is the effect of these three components to not only to the transl final translation, but also the confidence of the user. And like with the preliminary results, we know that they are most confident with the back translation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And not so confident with the w quality estimation or that word highlighting that we have implemented so far. And paraphrasing paraphrasing is like kinda yeah. It's sometimes it's helpful, and sometimes not. So yeah. Like the most helpful is back translation for them. Like from from those preliminary results. But this is still what we are like like doing a researching still.",
            "Okay. I'm sorry for the this bunch of questions, I was just thinking about it and and and thinking about what direction should I should take here. But the idea, the main idea here is to implement this constraint decoder and use it, right?",
            "Yeah, that that's definitely definitely good thing that that you are thinking about it in in the grand scale, because first of all, yeah. We will defi it'll help us avoid implementing or focusing on implementation of stuff, we will not even be needing in later experiments. So it like thinking this through at the beginning is definitely good good approach. And goops good start. And I don't know technically, well, first of all, I think if there is not anything else, we need to discuss like if people are not in like. People that are not involved in PROJECT3 and are not interesting in this conversation, can definitely leave and. Goodbye, just in case. And we can sort of like extend this meeting and and talk talk in more detail on on on the work. On your work. So, I don't know,. Okay, so let's let's continue. And. So w so what is. If I remember correctly, the email from PERSON1 was that he already did some implementation, right? Of the of the constraint decoding? But I don't remembel which type of constraint was actually implemented.",
            "Negative constraints. It's like in my view, it's just the w implementation of negative constraints and nothing else. So. But I don't think that it should be too complicated to implement. This is something that we were thinking about for like first thing for PERSON3 to do, maybe. Maybe because you are most skilled with PROJECT4 and.",
            "Yeah yeah, I see that.",
            "Yeah. And so there is an implementation of constraint decoding, just maybe let me let briefly explain if you haven't understood from our discussion so far. So what is that constraint decoding. You just put negative or positive constraints in the form of words and phrases, negatives are those that shouldn't appear in the output, in the translation and the positives that should appear in the in the output. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And this constraint decoding there is a paper of just help me recall to recall. PERSON13 and somebody, PERSON14 or I don't know his s first name. And it's about it's about this decoding, constraint decoding, and they have implemented this thing in sokai framework.",
            "So and okay, and PERSON1 which is a guy from ORGANIZATION1. He has been doing some experiments with negative constrainting, so he has implemented some negative constrainting into PROJECT4.",
            "Already. And so as I asked him what's the status and whether he wants to continue with it, he told me that he don't he doesn't want to continue, but he can help us if we want to continue with this and implement maybe positive constraints in there. So w so he promised to help us with the or maybe to discuss the things in the end of September or beginning of October when you jo PERSON2 and PERSON3 join us. Or it will be after ORGANIZATION3 deadlines, so he prefer not to solve this thing.",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "ORGANIZATION3 deadline.",
            "Well, yeah, I I tried something a little bit similar, but only on just only on token level, because we wanted to integrate translation memories into decoding to upweight things that that were found in translation memory. But we only experimented with very very simple type of constraints, like we computed some score and added that to the to the and p yeah, only on token level, not ngrams or phrases.",
            "So, that I guess that will get complicated pretty quickly with PROJECT4.",
            "Okay. I can point you to the paper that I was talking about.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because is one paper and there is an extension of this paper and I'm not sure which one of like whether this extension is also implemented in the sokai.",
            "But paper is implemented. So you can just skim through it and. I read it and like it seemed to me not to not to be be as difficult or so difficult to implement, like just.",
            "Yeah, it's something like Fast Lexically Constrained Decoding with Dynamic Beam Allocation -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, this one..",
            "Yeah, okay. Okay.",
            "Fast lexical is from Hu et al.? Yeah, isn't it? Or or not? Fast is from PERSON14?",
            "No, it's PERSON13. Yeah yeah.",
            "PERSON13, okay. Because there is then extension and it's from Hu et al. and it's called improved lexical.",
            "It's the same, it starts with instead of fast, you have improved.",
            "Okay, I'll have a look on that too.",
            "Yeah. But most of the thing it's like they explain it in the PERSON13 paper and this is just an extension maybe how to make it even faster, or like to to or to enable batch batching or batched processing or something like this, I don't remember exactly.",
            "Yeah, okay. I'll I'll h I'll have a look on it.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so so this is the thing that we are we were thinking to start with.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like with that constraint decoding or that PROJECT3. Yeah but this is something low level, how to how to make the constraint decoding happen or how to how to.",
            "Let the user select, what he wants to be in the output or what he wha doesn't want to be in the output and. But we still don't know what to, how to construct the experiment, this like yeah. That we asked PERSON2 to think about it. Okay and maybe I don't remember the beginning where I started, so maybe just PERSON9 you can return me to the to the path.",
            "Well, the the thing is that yeah. We still we still need to discuss in more detail, like what we will focus on more, but what I want to remind you is that it's still good to try to think about the problem outside of the task itself. Like we can handle it more general way and then in the end just to show the reviewers of the project our work, where we will show the possible research results and our approach to implementing these results into let's say the TNT translator, but in this case like we at least don't like it's not expected that we will evaluate whether this particular application of the results in the TNT translator is actually helpful for the users for for example. This this is probably not expected. Or this is definitely not expected. Because we didn't promise it in the project specification, so yeah, I just want to remind that keep that in mind. That means that you can you can really just take the take the previous work from the Hu et al. and look at the let's say like was weaknesses of their presented approach and try to focus on improving those, right? So that doesn't mean that you need to have the solution right away, but well, maybe maybe it's a good thing start thinking about it from from this point of view, right? Or like it would be good to discuss this also with PERSON8, so so like maybe maybe I'm not following what what he he he had in mind, but yeah, but I think that this should be fine. Anyway, from from the short. Can you hear me, right?",
            "Yes, I can hear you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't want to start talking with muted microphone. Okay so the thing is yeah, from the short term perspective until next week. Yeah, let's let's look at our possibilities of implementing the positive constraints, because I think we agreed on the fact that they will be useful in the future. Like compared to the negative constraints, right? I think we we agree on that, am I right? Or or not? Like?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. So yeah yeah let's let's let's look into this issue and what might might be the problems with implementations, I guess I guess you can discuss that with PERSON3. In in DMs or maybe via email. And we can again, like we can talk about it mo some more next week.",
            "Yeah, but. Maybe okay, you can you can start think about this, but then in the end I would because because I told PERSON1 that we will consult this thing with them as they imp like because he has implemented something with PROJECT4 already and.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so you can you can definitely start and then if you come up with anything so we can just ask them. But he prefers not to solve it before ORGANIZATION3. That's what I'm just. Like have the message from him.",
            "Maybe maybe as I mentioned, the more general approach, I mean the you you mentioned the assumption that the user doesn't know the target language. Yes, that's true in the in the context of outbound translation, but again, we can focus on the more general thing. When we can assume that he knows the target language and we just want to i like do the constraint decoding with the without dropping the translation quality, right? And then simply on anecdotal evidence have some examples in our TMT framework, when we include the the methods. In this case, let's say that the the positive constraints and we can show the reviewers that if we want to keep this and this in our like we want to keep the named entities in from the source sentence in the target this implementation in the framework actually like what's the term satisfies this condition and even though like we expect that the user doesn't know that it is correctly translated they can see that it is correctly translated, right? Because the the the cues about the correct translations that they should be provided by other bo modules, other output of of the word package, other tasks. And we focus on the on how to provide cues in other tasks and let's say now we we have this available. Maybe it's not like perfect, but we can assume that we have some some modules or or way of informing the user about the translation.",
            "Okay, yeah, again, I'm sorry about that this initial questions. That was just my I'm just trying to understand what was the point of of the task. But now now I know that we're just trying to apply this constraints correctly and make it appear to the user that the constraints are being applied to the tar to the target language, okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah, the thing the thing is maybe it wasn't completely clear, is that again, think about thinking about it on the module level level. Like if you if you thought about it as a whole, like you would really be be stuck on the fact that you also need to like provide the additional information to the user. But and and he he really has to learn that the output of the let's say navigation itself is useful for him. But again, you can just skip this and assume that you have the other stuff that you would need to have the complete package, right. So, still still there's there's the thing that you need to somehow evaluate, whether the constraints themselves are for example are not too restrictive, or what is the level, how you can restrict the decoding. Like I can't imagine if I if I say that I want to translate any sentence in a way that it will contain the the phrase at all costs, like there are definitely sentences that will not be translated or will definitely be translated poorly, if if that phrase must be included, right. So so may that's possible, the one possible way how to study the problem, right like. What is the level, how much we can actually constrain a system to still produce reasonable translations? I think I think no one actually looked into it that way, but again, that that there are other issues how how how to or or foc the other issues with this approach, you need to properly design the way to evaluate this and and such and study it.",
            "Okay, yeah, I understand. This is really interesting, right. We need to d to define the the threshold of the constraints right.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, if if I remember correctly, in the previous work from Hu et al., for example they evaluated the the performance, but there they their data was basically, they took the standard test sets and by s I think it was deterministic or not?, yeah I thonks there was some algorithm to kinda induce a constraint from this data. Like what might be the constraint that the user wants. And constrain the system and then evaluated it and they measured the performance speed and measured the whether the quality of the system drops, right. But this doesn't mean that the constraints are actually real life constraints, whether whether they are not completely like nonsense, right. I think they did not do proper or at least not thorough evaluation of of the way how they pick the the constraints, right. They were not handmade. So, yeah.",
            "I understand, yeah. Yeah. This is something we can try to to evaluate in this way.",
            "Yeah, but definitely, definitely good that you that you come up with these question, because it it's a good good starting point for everyone.",
            "Yeah, but. I I maybe I forgot to think about the the constraint itself, this is the mo the most important part, so I will look for alternatives on how to evaluate this. The number of constraints, how constraints can can lead to something that doesn't make sense, or how.",
            "Like in in this it's still still the thing is I it would be helpful hopefully next week PERSON8 will be available. It would be helpful to get his feedback on this, because he he still has the best use case examples for the task itself and that might also bring some inspiration. So, yeah. If if you think this through a little bit more that's definitely useful but I think next week we can discuss it and and make more of a progress, so.",
            "Right.",
            "It's fine. Okay, other than that, is there anything else we want to discuss or need to discuss? Like technically, we we sort of extended it to your daily meeting, like is there anything more more specific that that you come acr came across on Friday, I guess?",
            "No no, I'm fine. I was just reading other papers derived from Hu et all, or previous to th to it, just to understand better the constraint, because.",
            "Okay, okay, that's great.",
            "And and the one with the PERSON10 decoding, isn't it the one that was presented at this year's ORGANIZATION6?",
            "Oh, I didn't check that, I just found it somewhere, I don't know exactly, th but but I can check this.",
            "Cause I remember from there something about PERSON10, it's decoding and I think that there was something with the with constraint decoding, but I'm not sure what the what's the.",
            "Yeah, they apply positive constraints, just modifying the Leven PERSON10 transformer by adding adding the constraints in the beginning of the of the classifier. They have three classifiers, right? Deletion deletion.",
            "Yeah yeah yeah.",
            "Placeholder and token. So they add this in the in the beginning and then then masks the the constraints to to to for the tokens not to be deleted, right, during the process. And then just the place and for the placeholder, for example, if you have a phrase that can be divided, so it forces the the classifier not to place to the the placeholder between the this phrase. So.",
            "It achieves some some good results, but I didn I I read it today, so I'm not sure about the details yet, but it it's an interesting because it's not it just it it keeps the same speed on the the standard PERSON10 PERSON10. As far as I'm concerned. This was the. But I didn't know the PERSON10 PERSON10.",
            "PERSON10 transformer it's a some kind on. Because normally you have autoregressive trans like decoding that everything you decode at one time, you it's like depends on what's you have decoded so far. So you are like decoding one word at the time, or one token at the time. And with this non autoregressive approach it was actually PERSON7's, it a colleague of us, he's leaving to ORGANIZATION1, it was his like research area. And yeah. But the thing is that in the end like okay, the theoretically this non autoregressive decoders are good or they are theoretically faster. But when those guys in ORGANIZATION1 apply all of those hacks and quantizations and model distillations and everything their autoregressive decoding is much faster than any non autoregressive decoding so far. But yeah, but theoretically is, yeah.",
            "Ok I understand.",
            "To explore, but.",
            "Yeah because.",
            "In the end, PERSON6 PERSON6 will always ask you that okay but is it really faster than PROJECT4? When.",
            "In practice, we don't.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is different. But okay, yeah, I was just trying to find alternatives and.",
            "Yeah yeah, just feel free.",
            "Okay, yeah. But.",
            "I saw that you have I I've approved you to the Zotero library.",
            "I don't know if I should I don't know if I should join that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's like I only maybe it's just me who is using it regularly. Or regularly, yeah, okay. So I collected there several papers that I'm just collected o in the end of the last year or the beginning of the 2020 when we were thinking about doing some how it's called? Descri. No, those generative networks, sorry I forgot. And yeah, so I have collected several papers there and there is a like also there are those two papers about constraint decoding. So just feel free to add anything interesting there and add any notes there, yeah.",
            "Okay, yeah, PERSON9 told me to create this Zotero account and and to manage, make a better arrangement of these papers.",
            "PERSON9 can also join our group.",
            "Yeah, I I'm kinda you know individualistic. I I don't have papers that are useful for everyone, so I I'm ever really include that. But I can do some some look up.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I didn't know if I should join, but I I I clicked that.",
            "Oh, definitely, if you have something if you have something related to the project, include it there, like just because I don't do it doesn't mean that you you shouldn't. Like that's the whole point of the of the PROJECT1 Zotero or of the.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, great. Yeah, so like the bu the list of papers about this lexically constraint approaches of machine translation and maybe. But there are also approaches about genera text generation, right. I don't know if I can use text generation machine translation yet.",
            "You mean in those collection of papers? In Zotero?",
            "No, sorry I I was I changed the subject during the during my speech, sorry, it wasn't just. Forget about it. About Zotero, yeah, I will add something there, I think it's interesting about this constraints and.",
            "It's, Zotero is just feel to feel free to add anything there. Maybe you can also create the special folder for lexically constrained decoding and put all those papers that are related to this topic to this folder.",
            "Yeah, using this way already in my own fo my own organization.",
            "Yeah yeah, or just put text, you can tag the papers or yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's really good, yeah. It's helpful.",
            "Also, you mentioned the the text generation. Again it's well there might be some things that we can use. But in our case we do do sort of conditional text generation, right. Translation is text generation, but it is conditioned on the input sentence.",
            "But technically yeah. The the decoding part is text generation and and the the the text generation papers might be relevant to to this research, so there's no problem with that.",
            "Oh oh I found I found a paper. I'm sorry I have today, I have lots of things to say.",
            "No that's good, that's good.",
            "Normally, I don't have that much. But. Well I found one that deals with noisy constraints, so the idea that the user is writing things to be constrained. But it it's wrong in some way or there is a problem with that so I didn't finish the the reading yet, but is this something to worry about or forget about it and think that everything that will pass to to be constrained will be correct?",
            "I'm not sure, can you can you send me the link for the paper and maybe yeah we can look into it tomorrow?",
            "Yeah, sure, I will will read it today and we can discuss a little bit also, okay.",
            "Yeah yeah. I will at least try to look at the abstract and the summary of the of the paper to get the general idea. But yeah.",
            "I can imagine.",
            "But definitely.",
            "Like if the constraint is noisy, you mean like that there are some typos in it? Or something like this?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah so I like I think that there might be use case, because you are you as a user you're maybe you're in a hurry you want the translation like as fast as quick as possible, you make a typo and if if the those cues are robust enough to get or to deal with the typo, it would be great, yeah. So, yeah, we can also be interested in those like noisy things.",
            "Okay, yeah. I will I will send the link and we can discuss tomorrow and I will have I will describe it better. Because I didn't read it I didn't read it yet. So well for me, for my side, from my side, it's everything. I I. Thank you for all the explanations.",
            "Oh well hopefully, they were helpful, alright, yeah okay. So so yeah we we can so we will talk to each other tomorrow and this is fine I guess. Yeah, okay, so so I guess in case of PERSON3, I think it's fine if you join us next week.",
            "Okay.",
            "Just to still be sort of updated and have have some idea.",
            "Sure.",
            "What is going on with this. We will we will not push you into much push you too much now that you're still not officially employed, so I think it's fine. Yeah.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "Normally we want those these meetings to to spend only 30 minutes, but this time.",
            "Sure.",
            "We decided that from the beginning that we should regular meetings for him with him just for him to be part of the team. So that's why it was prolonged to an hour we discussed. So sorry about that.",
            "Yeah so so so basically. No no.",
            "Normally it's spent only or should spent only like 30 minutes.",
            "Yeah, so so so the idea yes the that today this this meetings are sort of updates. And you know to well originally, it was to keep PERSON8 updated that everything is going to plan and such. But it's true that that list is now now starting and we definitely should try to discuss and and have maybe semi-regular meetings like once per week, when we can talk about the the options or like the the possible research direction in more detail that's definitely going to be necessary.",
            "Yeah and we should we should definitely write it down somehow, or all the ideas because just talking about it is great. But I will remember nothing.",
            "That's what the that's what the ORGANIZATION7 Doc is for.",
            "So the agenda agenda doc?",
            "Yeah yeah that's what the bullet points that's what the bullet points are for there.",
            "Or maybe the doc that we created for PERSON2 should be more suitable for this. If we want to list.",
            "Okay, we can. Like if it going to create a document for the task itself, it should definitely be linked in the agenda document too. So we can easily like get get to that. But yeah, I.",
            "There is one, PERSON9, there is one that we created for PERSON2 in the beginning, and yeah so.",
            "Yeah, it explains the task and so can use that.",
            "We can continue in like in this document to write everything.",
            "Yeah, that's definitely good idea. Yeah can you please send me the link in ORGANIZATION2? I will include it on top of the agenda document -",
            "I can send you.",
            "Yes, definitely. Okay thanks.",
            "Oh yeah could somebody add me to the ORGANIZATION2 workspace?",
            "Okay, I.",
            "Because I'm not there yet.",
            "Okay I I will send it send it to through email.",
            "Great, thanks.",
            "Okay, so I will do that and I will tell PERSON6 to include you to the project repository.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think that's everything we needed to discuss today. So I guess see you see you in a week and see you PERSON3 in a week and see you PERSON2 tomorrow.",
            "Tomorrow.",
            "Okay, see you guys.",
            "Okay, bye.",

            "So let's switch to English right away. Thanks for all of you, for for, to all of you for for the work and thanks for joining the call. As always the call will close sharply at quarter to 5 and we have 30 minutes to to discuss. So I see PERSON16 connecting, so I'll start and I would first of all make a big thank you to to PERSON16, PERSON13 also an and PERSON9 and and PERSON5. And also PERSON9 but I'm not sure how how much you contributed there for the edible SLT submission. So I I'm still totally lost in how many submissions we actually made. So I'll organize that. Hopefully PERSON20 is little bit more oriented in. We have now 4 or 3 days to to write the papers. So these are system papers and they should be as detailed as as necessary to explain what the systems are. So please, actually, let's let's make use of this call to summarize the submissions. So PERSON16, if you're still here-Oh, I see PERSON13 twice. Is that correct?.",
            "I think, PERSON13 exists only once.",
            "I don't see PERSON13 even once.",
            "Oh, that's interesting. Like I'm a participants. There is.",
            "PERSON13.",
            "I I see him 3 times now.",
            "Yes, ok, I think it's going crazy. So PERSON13, how many times are you corrected?",
            "Yeah, so I suspect, I suspect that you have 2 devices connected and they are now trying to mute each other, so we don't hear you,, much. It was very interrupted. So if you, if you could, if, if these 3 PERSON13 connection are from 1 room, then it's very risky. Yeah, if it's someone else, just re-using your name, then that's ok.Yeah, ok, so PERSON16, can you summerize what are the submissions, because I'm, I know that you have done a lot of work, thank you, but I'm I'm lost.",
            "Yes, so there is online ASR, it's ORGANIZATION6. And it's the hybrid worker for Antrecorp and and the worker number 1 for the other domains. This is the submission. This is translated by into German. And by there, edible SLT 2019 into Czech and that's the primarys submission for online SLT. Then we have offline ASR, the primary PERSON6. And primary, primary offline SLT uses the same workers as online SLT. And then us non, non-primary submissions I I submitted. PERSON6 ASR translated by every worker we have. And except the ORGANIZATION6 German, because it's not easy for me. And PERSON5's ASR translated by the workers I could get in the time pressure.",
            "Mmm-mmm, yeah, ok. Yeah, so I suggest that you still run even now after the deadline, that you still run also the other MT, like to to make the tables complete, so to say, in the paper. So not all of the, not all of the submissions that that, not all of the runs will be officially evaluated. But most of them will, and for the others, it is still interesting to know them using like they the scoring that that you will use in the in the paper. So, so to make the tables complete, please finalize the runs. I missed some of the details, but well, if if you can them, for summary edit this document. So, the the primary online, that's the very main thing, how did it work, how did it compare to-So the Google translate, another things have you obtain that or not at all. Or has PERSON1 obtain that?",
            "Yes, but they they were not online. The only online ASR.",
            "Say it again.",
            "The only online ASRs are the 3 by ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Yeah, ok. Yeah, and the offline ones. How how well did they score in your measures? Like I'm I'm curious about what can we expect,. Whether we can.",
            "I haven't evaluated.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Then by blas scores.",
            "Yeah. So we know just the ASR scoring and their the.",
            "And blas scores on the 3 ORGANIZATION6 online ASRs. Because they were ready in advance.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's why I could evaluate them, but but still. In the end I decided to drop Antrecorp. Because it's very unstable. So I, I made an average of the scores of the 3 ASRs and pick the best.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Worker.",
            "Regardless, regardless Antrecorp files. Regardless the 2 Antrecorp files.",
            "Yes, so only and auditing, because.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Long document.",
            "Yeah. And we have, we have PERSON5 on the call. So a big warning that I was discussing with-So actually and and also PERSON9, the big warning is about the ORGANIZATION3 ASR system by PERSON10. Because that was trained on ORGANIZATION5 corpus, so they're, but you were not comparing this system PERSON16, if I understand correctly. Making the judgement, base on the ORGANIZATION5 performance, or based on a dev set, which includes ORGANIZATION5 would be an over estimation of the ORGANIZATION3 ORGANIZATION5 trained system. But that was not in your comparison, so that's, like, the choice was not affected in in anyway. Ok.",
            "I'm I'm trying to figure out better the ORGANIZATION5 dev set was included in the ORGANIZATION3 ORGANIZATION5.",
            "It's very likely. Because we have selected the files. And they are the first files in the corpus, so it's very likely that they were included. We did not-So, we selected or PERSON1 selected these files from ORGANIZATION5 corpus. And the goal was to have as non-native speakers as possible in this in these files. And also the domain should be somewhat related and these were the criteria to select it. So we didn't follow any trained deaf test division that would be available for ORGANIZATION5 corpus. So it's it's very likely. Ok, so thanks, thanks also for the details. Now, I need to synchronize with PERSON13, probably at the end of the call, but the main question is, yes no question. Whether PERSON13 could make sure that from 11 or some time before that actually, our system is ready to subtitle or well, not subtitle, the paragraph view is what we what we want now. The Czech meeting it's, that's a very formal thing actually, that's one of the one of the departments of the LOCATION1 city-So the LOCATION1 city is run by several organizations, this one is about the new development, so when they are deciding where to put bridges and where to where to make new suburbs, this is the, this is the people who are deciding. And they have theyl their weekly meetings, and they agreed to have their meetings recorded so I'll I will forward you ZOOM link and I have the permission that I can connect then and you as well, and we need to record that as a back up in case the recording button doesn't work for them. They are not sure whether they will a manage it. And we can use that for the minuting later on. And I also told them that we will subtitle it, they'll be talking Czech. So I would like to send them the link to the to the only the quest view, not the subtitles and for in, like I would just for curiosity it will be interesting to also translate it into English and German, maybe. So it's not not the point to have too many languages, but the point is just to illustrate it. So if you could prepare the set up. And we should probably test it either late toni later tonight or with one of the ZOOM links that ORGANIZATION4, the school can provide. That'll be ideal. Or tomorrow in the morning, but that would be kind of tricky. So if you could after this call, get your machine ready to follow the sound. Make sure that you can record the sound. So that we have the back up. And do not trust if possible. But, and to to have the pipeline for Czech ASR into displaying Czech, English and German. Yeah, so that's that's one one like last minute request. I known this while ago but I forgot to ask it specifically. Yeah, thank you. And then, for for edible SLT I know that PERSON14 is here and he has also type the the progress, but I'm afraid that his microphone somehow not excepted not recognized. Maybe it is forbidden in the in the browser, so PERSON14 maybe you need to like de maybe you have click remember permanently not to use the microphone or something like that. So PERSON14 probably cannot speak, so I would like to know what is the status of the PROJECT1 of the edible SLT test set. You have been working on that, you've created the the visualization of the subtitles, the word level time stamping of those and you've we're working on the evaluation script, that's that's good., but still, the ASR files are something which we are not ready to evaluate. We're ready to evaluate SLT, so thanks for that. But what is the status, and how many files are not manually processed yet. That would be something that I would like to hear from PERSON14. So let's this is a test for PERSON14 was able to listen to me.",
            "Yes.",
            "Oh great, amazing. So please just let me know how many files are still in with the annotators.",
            "Yes, hi all. E-mail contain the remaining files, but the most question is about files in Because the words in files and the OST files are not the same. Do they need to be talk again?",
            "We can change the-So that's, some of these files are correct and some are not and this is, this is what I was trying to explain to you in in an e-mail. So the the goal is to had the transcript match the sound and one really has to listen to the sound and check which of the files matches the sound. I don't think that there would be inter annotator agre disagreement that different people would hear different things in the sounds. It is possible with, if someone is mumbling, but that would be like a rare thing. And at this rare thing it really doesn't matter. So if it's this rare thing, someone mumbling, and 2 annotators doing differently then feel free to switch to the EAF because that is word level annotated and modify modify the OSTT. That's like as as if switching to another goal standard. But it's it's mumbling region. So it is not too important. Most people would not understand what is being said anyway. But if it's if it's like a technical difference, that someone like, it's not clear to me why we have this difference. So if it's a technical difference, that some people spell out abbreviations and some don't then again we need to make like an annotation decision and choose one of these. So this is essentially where there is a conflict, it means that it has to be manually revised. And I think it would be best if you could do it, PERSON14. So if you could look at these this mismatches, and manually choose. We we want to have the time labeled transcripts. So choosing the EAF file is better is an easier option. Because you will get the time stamps with that. But if the EAF files are wrong, we don't really want to to like make this regression and go to something worse than what we already have. So in that case, you should modify and like correct the EAF files based on the OSTT. Because the OSTT were created by experienced people, like most of them pro not all of them, maybe that there could be errors everywhere. But I would be tempted to trust the OSTT files a little bit more. But we do want the annotation from the EAF files. So that's why the the merge the manual merge is is inevitable I think. So does that make sense?",
            "So, correct EAF files per Yeah?",
            "I, there were many gaps in your in the sound from you. I think you said that you will correct the EAF files based on the OSTT files.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes and no. I would prefer you to correct the EAF files based on the sound. Add the places where the OSTT files show the mismatch. So in another words, go over the points of the mismatch as you locate them in the texts. But to decide what is the correct thing, do not trust the OSTT. Trust only the sound.",
            "If you agree, I will tell the 2 version of them. Once per and one base on corrected version.",
            "But what what will you based the correction on? What will be the basis for the correction for the EAF files?",
            "Can change EAF files based on OST f.",
            "No, no, no it's, you really have to trust the sound. The only golden trust is the sound. So we, the EAF files and the OSTT files are equally likely to have transcription errors. So it's like an annotators mismatch and to resolve the mismatch it's not a good idea to just flip a coin and choose one of those. The correct idea is to use these mismatches to find the spots and hear again what it's what is in the sound.",
            "But I listen to sound but there are very and I could not find, I could not understand.",
            "Ok, ok, so so if you but you should do this for every place. So for every place of the mismatch, if you do not understand choose the EAF and modify the OSTT according to the EAF. If you do understand then choose the correct thing. And that could be anywhere.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so please prepare this list, complete list of mismatches, which file which words, like generated automatically if it's too long. Or if it's too too limited then just do it yourself. And fix it on the spot. But if this list is long, then generate automatically and send it to me and PERSON18 and we will check whether will decide whether the annotators could do the the decisions. So you do you would not have to do the listening yourself. But you have to list all the not just the files, but the spots in the files.",
            "Yeah, I will do it.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you.",
            "And excuse me, and the for And I make an Kaldi for them by tomorrow or.",
            "Yeah, so the ORGANIZATION5 corpus should be correct. We generally trust the word level time stamps. Show I sh I would not worry too much, but yes please that would be good if if you still create it.",
            "Yeah, thanks.",
            "Yeah, ok thank you. So that that was PERSON14, I'm happy that you were all able to to hear his voice, because he he was supposed to be in LOCATION1, but he is now running his extern ship instead, suppose to internship. And yeah, so let's go quickly further. For the PROJECT1 test set I would like to, I I don't know, yes PERSON22 is here as well. So later on when PERSON22 presents I would like to hear what is the status. Where is the table, if PERSON22 could put here the table the link to the table where there is each of the files. And the annotators who are now processing them and at what status are are there. What is the overall status. So-Yeah.",
            "I will link here.",
            "Yeah, what is the overall status and also how many annotators are waiting and for what. So I want to see the length of the queues kind of. So these are our workers they should they should be working and not waiting. So we need to to give them some some work. Put it directly to the not as a comment, put it directly as a as a sub sub point. Thank you. And for the PROJECT1 test set usage I would like to ask PERSON13 and PERSON9 to start using the PROJECT1 test set. So we already have 1 or 2 files, that's not too many. But I would like the cruise control to start running still manually but so that we would see how are MT systems are processing the files in the PROJECT1 test set. So this is, this is something that it ha it doesn't have to be done this week but this is something that you should like plan and hopefully from the next week for example you should know how to do it and then it should become like push of a button thing for you. Yeah. Then we have this list of submissions thanks for all the details. Then we've already discussed PERSON14, so thank you. And now PERSON13, please can you briefly say what you have been working on? If if we have at least on the 3 PERSON13s. PERSON13, can you hear us? I s-Yeah, PERSON13 can you hear us? Yeah, and does it does the microphone work for you, can you just briefly summarize so we have what you have been working on?",
            "Yeah, sure. So I have been working on - and using pre-trained fastest.",
            "Hmm-hmm.",
            "Because it was Solution and everyone advised to - This could be a bit of task.",
            "Ok.",
            "And - Because the repositories where links to check -",
            "Sorry, so so the sound for some reason your network connection is very bad. I don't know if you're running on on wif on on Wi-fi or wired connection or. Your connection seems to be much worse than normally and this this worries me especially for tomorrow. So for the for the recording, if if you were som Yeah, ok, but anyway, yes I I I know that you are working on these 2 things and there're like serious technical issues. This failure did I understand correctly that the repositories are not available? That the source code in is missing? Or did I guess wrongly? Yeah, I I still don't understand so so like probably some strange programming language used. That's that's my guess what you are saying.Yeah. And then you were working on the edible SLT segmentation and punctuation. Ok.",
            "Programming language.",
            "Just write it down I don't, yeah, I can't that it's, I cannot understand.",
            "He he found us In the R programming language.",
            "Oh in the R, yes, that's a horrible program language with the worst, yeah. That should be surpassable but it's complicated, yes.",
            "2014.",
            "Yeah, w-That's the the R language is extremely old and it it didn't I'm sure it didn't change in the last 6 years. So it it's probably it should be possible to to get it running the best R expert in this department is PERSON21 by the way.So you can ask PERSON21 but she's a linguist not a programmer but she she has done some serious R coding herself. And she.",
            "Yeah, anyway, anyway I haven't done much R coding myself but I know that basically R is maintained at in Zurich. And I and I also have some subject in R so maybe if like if.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If something totally doesn't work maybe just ask me and maybe I will know but I I'm I by me no by no means I I'm no expert.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So so PERSON13 you have now 2 people to ask, PERSON21, she will probably not understand the technical things but she wa she was in touch with people who use it more often. And then and then PERSON9 we should be able to get get over this and also do get in touch with the students actually from from that seminar of mine, PERSON8 Jenč and PERSON19, because the it's also their their task. So by discussion with them you should be able to overcome this. Yeah, ok. And then you have done all the all the technical work for the segmentation and yeah. So, ok, thank you, let's let's let's proceed. And, but PERSON13 please let me know by e-mail what's with your connection because for tomorrow session that will be very bad. If we-Yeah, ok thank you. So we have PERSON16, who has submitted all the many system, thanks. The definish of translation lag was sentence catch up it's still imperfect. It make a negative Ok, so there is still an improvement of the definition. Feel free to describe that to the edible SLT submission or whatever.",
            "Yes. And we need to decide how many system description papers.",
            "Yes, yes. Yeah, so that's a main question for PERSON5 as well. And for PERSON1 and and you. So how many, is it 4 pages? What is the limit?",
            "I don't know, I haven't looked yet.",
            "Yeah, I'll let me check.",
            "But the more papers the better for me, because I won't need to care about the others.",
            "Yes, that's true.",
            "Mostly PERSON5's work and PERSON1 in the others.",
            "System papers are due April 24th, must be. Well system papers do not need to be. And 4 to 8, 4 to 8 so 4 is the lower bound actually.",
            "Ok.",
            "In in way if, yeah. So so how many, so the question is so PERSON5 can probably re-use some of his thesis text. As the description of the systems that he used. So that could easily like made sufficient content. But it should not steal to much of like new things. It should be just brief summary. And so I think that PERSON5's submission is the most distingue from others. So PERSON5, are you are you here, can you can you talk, can you, can you confirm?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, so so do you do you agree to write a separate paper?",
            "Ooo, yes I can. Because I can, as as you said I can re-use my part of my thesis.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I done 5 separate submissions. We need to figure out which are which we take. Because, because I just 1 minute after me PERSON16 send me an e-mail with si where I was sees it. That with some with some of my some of my systems. But I I submitted all the task, I submitted ASR SLT to to Czech and SLT to German. And.",
            "That was with PROJECT2, right? That was with PROJECT2 translation.",
            "Yes, yes. Both both SLTs will were with PROJECT2. I I don't know if I had use the good, good models, because there were many models to choose so.",
            "For PROJECT2?",
            "Yeah. I I think there were many many English model, I don't know how much German models there were. But for English there were at least 2 or 3 systems.",
            "Like from initiating to watch.",
            "English to Czech.",
            "English to Czech 3, oh, ok.",
            "At least. So I chosen the default ones, so hopefully.",
            "Hopefully, yeah.",
            "Yeah. And so I don't know I I checked random leader quality of the translation and it's it was horrible, I would say.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But but so are the so are the.",
            "The sources.",
            "SLT so so I don't think there's much to to translate actually. But hopefully we will see.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is a question for PERSON16. Which which submission should we take. He-PERSON16 you you s you have written something like that it's like subset of my word or something.",
            "Yes. I think your ASRs, your offline ASRs can be mark as primary in your submissions. And I don't mind to to pass the translations I did from your source as as in your submission. So you I think you still can mark 1 as primary, can't you?",
            "Ok, so and which the translation model did you use?",
            "Many of them, but one of them is the one that I used as as primary for our submissions, for the new rainbow worker for German and.",
            "And it's the different one from the from the online ORGANIZATION1 translation model.",
            "Do you mean the one that is in PROJECT2 website?",
            "I don't know whether it is PROJECT2 or ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Yeah, it has to be a different one because it's PERSON18 worker anyway. Right.",
            "Which worker?",
            "Well.",
            "So PERSON9 created their new rainbow worker.",
            "No no no.",
            "Last night, no?",
            "It PERSON15's so, PERSON15's new worker.",
            "PERSON15's new wo, ok. So the the easiest thing the easiest way to organize this is actually to have the 2 papers, so PERSON5 please set up. You already are probably on on copy, you know the overleaf for the PERSON16's submission.",
            "Yes.",
            "Please make similar one. And let's simply organize what is the primary submission and what what all submissions are there in the paper and then this is what I'll use for the official summary as as well. So use the papers, now follow what what is now in the Google document, the su the submissions. So maybe discuss still for a while, like what, yeah it's it's-I I haven't expected, this is actually a big achievement but I haven't expected that we'll have so many systems to to choose from. So that is, that is great. But we need to no not to loose ourselves in that in that long list. So.",
            "I I can show you.",
            "Yeah, yeah, please do. Can you share the screen?",
            "I I'm going to put here the link.",
            "Ok.",
            "Here.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And it it's too very messy and I organize.",
            "And why is it called copy of?",
            "Because PERSON9 evaluated blascors of all the systems and then pass pass it to me in his spreadsheet and I did the copy.",
            "I didn't give you really any access so how?",
            "So now which sheet should we be looking at? Because there is, I saw this table in the morning from you, thank you. But I I didn't know where where to look.",
            "See as final view, the first sheet in the left. Yeah and I highlighted both the tool, the the one that I've chose as a candidate for Czech.",
            "So this is primary right? This is primary.",
            "Yes.",
            "So actually I'll put here primary and ash it should have a name. So like primary for PERSON16's in PERSON16's paper, right?",
            "Yes. For Czech.",
            "For Czech, yeah yeah. Primary and 2 CS in PERSON16's paper. And then what else. This is the the other one, so is it, this is the same thing, right? Primary in.",
            "Yes. by the document.",
            "By the document, yes, exactly. Ok.",
            "Maybe the other defaulted thing. And in the second sheet in the.",
            "In DEOL right? Yeah.",
            "Yes, below there is, if you look at the auditing part, that's here the option for English to German. And I.",
            "Am I correct that line 54 is the primary?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, ok. So primary English to the in PERSON16's paper. Right.",
            "This ASR, edible SLT 20 others core 1.",
            "Yeah. S-Ok so the first column is the machine translation system, the second column is the ASR, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "MT ASR document, then ble and what, what is the last one?",
            "Yeah, ok. Yeah, s, yeah that's a goal translations. The ASR, yeah. So the, that's clear. Yeah, yeah, ok. So this is it is a little bit clear. The first sheet, which is empty, can we actually delete it or is there something on on that? This list.",
            "Where is it?",
            "The very first sheet.",
            "Aha, I didn't see. It was, I I'm going to delete it.",
            "Yeah, ok, please do.",
            "Yeah, ok. So so it will be good if PERSON16 you could evaluate also the PERSON5's runs or and and and PERSON1, PERSON1 where are your systems? Are their included in these tables?",
            "No because they were not segmented.",
            "Ok. Yeah.",
            "So because I I didn't know whether to evaluate all the systems on test set that it's seems unnecessary that we like should I evaluate even like the Google submission and Microsoft and.",
            "Yes, please do. Exactly, please do, yes, please do. This will useful for.",
            "Because so far it's only on dev set, but I haven't eval I haven't process the test set.",
            "Yeah, yeah please do process it. So I'll I'll have to write the the summary paper. And the question is whether we want to use these numbers also in the submission papers or whether I'll simply steel these numbers from you and use them in the in the overview picture. But I'll need the outputs in any case. So if you can run this. It's like the ans the an well, simply the online submissions, the the submissions that we just ran.",
            "And should I ran them on all parts of the test set?",
            "Yes. Yes. So please do and please send them to.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "To me and PERSON14 and also PERSON20.",
            "Ok, so I I will do that.",
            "Yeah, thank you. So your systems are not included, the question is whether they-So they they make secondary submissions, right? Like non-primary submissions. Or sh do you have enough submissions based on your ASR so that it would make a third paper?",
            "I I don't think that there is too much to write about them to fill in a whole paper.",
            "So the question is whether we, whether whey are s, where some of them are very likely to be good ones. And that could be either yours or by PERSON17. Which systems do we really trust. So I would trust the ORGANIZATION6 system for ASR and then whatever PERSON16 has chosen for MT but I would equally much trust the the system that you have. And also the the PERSON10 system. So, what what what scored better in terms of ASR for, was it your systems or PERSON10's?",
            "Well it's, I think the ORGANIZATION2 and models are almost likes, very similar. And then Google scored slightly better. And there is Microsoft somewhere in the me middle. And the ORGANIZATION5 based system scored quite well, but it very likely that it may -",
            "So from my point of view, it would actually make more sense if you wrote a third paper, because this is like distinct tables. PERSON16 would supervise what he evaluated, you would supervise what you evaluated and PERSON5 would supervise what what he evaluated. So that the main author, the first author of each of these papers will be responsible for the tables to be like internally consistent. And that's the easiest way to achieve this. Another option is that that we put all the submissions into 1 folder, and 1 will oversee each measure. So what do you prefer? That's for each for up to you each of you.",
            "Well, I I'm not sure if I can fill like 4 to 8 pages of paper by describing the systems. Well I can describe like all the I don't know, hyper parameters and stuff, but I.",
            "So so then please please write it as like a separate section into PERSON16's overleaf for now. But please describe it there.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Just a warning, in 2 minutes we'll be cut off. Or maybe less. Yeah, so so please describe it in PERSON16's paper. And we'll we'll see. So make it like a separate table for now and as I wrote already some time ago, please put full paths to the outputs in the paper, as comments at least. Or make it, make them even visibly in the in the PDF. Ok. Have we missed anybody? PERSON22, you'll be cut off. So you're still preparing the test sets. Oh.",
            "Yeah, actually I got to resend the link from PERSON4 for and other languages. So.",
            "Yeah, so you're preparing more, ok that's good.",
            "I think it's already prepared and maybe I'll send-Because I'm waiting his res her response. As you know we have already send some tested data for validation.",
            "Please, please check the outputs that PERSON18 sent. So that we can confirm whether this was good or not.",
            "Ok, I."

At this point we still have the we have the repo with sample clients, And we need to decide. And it's still only the sample and it's not production. So we need to discuss who is respons who will be responsible to maintain it, As fo f who to create and maintain the production version, And whether it will be in C or Python.",
            "Is there an option for doing it in Python? As far as I knew, there was no,, library to connect to the mediator in Python.",

            "Should be, but I can check it again.",
            "Yeah, I can see only this one. I'm always using this one. Yep. Python binding example. I tried to build to start using this, but I would need some more explanation how to build this tool if we need if we want to -",

I personally think that the easiest will be to move the C version from sample to production, and continue in C version, cause this will be, I think, the fastest way to continue on it, and we need to made it robust and continue on this, Although my I myself, I'm not C programmer, so it will take me s time to learn it, but it seems to be the easiest way for me.",

I'm stronger with Python than I than in C, but it's small walk to use to start using Python than C, so it's up to you. So are you going to create a Python binding, PERSON2?",

            "Yeah. So we stay with Python. Maybe I c. Oh no. I can't promise anything too. So, the test to. We need some test scripts to test all the pipeline and run it in single command. I already did something, Like this. Or. So, we have this repository cruise control on. It's a private repository, so please, PERSON2 and everyone in ORGANIZATION3, make sure that you have access here. If not, send us your GitHub accounts and we will add you. It's not problem. So, later we will have here one command to install the client, And then run. Run some test like this. And if your worker fails on the test, then you can update it and fix the bug and test it again.",

            "Okay, if anyone doesn't have,, access there, please write your name in the ORGANIZATION2 Docs and I will add you, okay?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah, or. Oh, it doesn't matter. So, so the. And, admin web today, it's it's quite simple. It only it only displays such list of workers. PERSON11, ar do you plan to update it to made it more advance?",
            "Well, actually,, we haven't plan it,, but, of course, we appreciate any feedback. PERSON1 told me you were looking for some kind of,, check fingerprint functionality.",
            "Yes.",
            "The,, web, the web,, interface has also the search path.",
            "Yes.",

            "Yeah.",

            "Of course, improvements.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I have to say that probably we'll not be ready for the June session.",
            "Okay, for me it would be okay if you provided us a command-line example how to use this search button, So we can write a script to run it from command-line to use the search.",
            "Actually, the admin web is database based, Then the reason the, the worker subscribes and when they subscribe, a database is written.",
            "Yes.",
            "Database record is written. Then the reason t, at the moment, a command-line solution perform the same functionality.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But,, we can plan it to introduce you us. It t's of course.",
            "Okay. And if I want if I have several workers from for example from, From English from English audio to Czech translation, and I. And the and the workers are connected. And I hit the Search, does it find the whole path through several workers, or only one worker? This search.",
            "The searcher will explain you the, the full path. However, you have to,, write the exact,, fingerprint you will use. At the moment, the functionality of,, approximation of the fingerprint is disabled in order to -",
            "Have more control over selected path.",
            "Okay.",
            "Then, if you write the exact input and output it will work.",
            "Yeah, okay. So which -",
            "At least I hope so. It should work, it's much,, correct.",
            "Which machine translation from German is available right now? or from English to the - Okay, so let's let's. We can go through it later.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so, Safe and. Yeah, my suggestion was to dis to have a way to distribute the logs from all workers to everyone, so _",
            "Yes,, this is, of course, a reasonable,, request. However, at the moment, the mediator is installed on our server, which are under VPN connection, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And it's not possible. However,, we can schedule,, some kind of coordinated checks.",
            "We can schedule-check and we will check the logs while you test functionalities, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or you can ask us to provide you the log of the last week, for example, And we can keep them -",
            "Manually and send them to you, of course, and to all the, the participants, of course.",
            "But at the moment,, let's say, sale servis on log is not available for,, architectural reason, Because it's under VPN, and we cannot provide -",
            "Yeah.",
            "You access.",
            "Okay, and the logs from workers which run on some other servers?",
            "Actually, workers are distributed, then we cannot obtain logs of, for example, ORGANIZATION3, -",
            "Yes.",
            "Workers.",
            "Such workers has such logs has to be provided by ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Yes, yes, I'm asking ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Okay.",
            "Fe.",
            "Same story for us. The, -",
            "Okay.",
            "The workers are under some specific firewall rules.",
            "To connect the mediator but not much else.",
            "Okay, so it's it's not easy, so you'll probably have to learn to live without it. Also -",
            "Well, actually,, we can schedule, for example, a coordinated test among all the participants in order to check altogether logs and also have access to all the logs together.",
            "For example, ORGANIZATION3 -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Will have a look at ORGANIZATION3's log, we will have look at ORGANIZATION8 logs and so on.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. My idea was that, While the conference is running and I'm trying to connect a client, Then I want to see immediately what's happening on ORGANIZATION3's ORGANIZATION3's ASR worker without asking PERSON4 to on ORGANIZATION1. So this would be ea much easier, but if -",
            "Yes. I -",
            "If the logs can be available after the session, once which from the whole week, then it's not u much useful.",
            "Yes, I - I completely understand.",
            "Yeah.",
            "However, maybe we can reason. Not for June, but maybe for,, the further years. To plan some kind of logs publication service, let's say -",
            "In order to have centralized log application.",
            "Yes. Yeah.",
            "It's it's not on plan, I have to say, but for testing reason might be useful. Of course, this is completely out of -",
            "Distributed system scope.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So let -",
            "Or I can try and I don't know f if this can be arranged, But I can ask whether you can be given server access, so you could -",
            "Look at the logs on our service yourself.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "And I can see if that if that can be arranged.",
            "Yes. Yes, this could work. Can get access to their server to check the logs online. Thank you. So let's move to ASR workers for the PROJECT1. So, PERSON2, do your ASR worker emit some special tags? Like applause or laughter or s or something like this? Cause if yes, that we need to we would need to,, use them in our segmentation and maybe in MT. This would be good to know.",
            "I cannot actually tell you that, because I don't work on the ASR workers. I was hoping that and I thought the PERSON4 would be good. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can't say.",
            "Okay, so let's let's move this to PERSON4. To do PERSON4. Okay, and so for the June event, we need we need to run 2 se 2 ASR workers, because we will have 2 o 1 English source and 1 English repeater, Which wi which is a students of interpreting, And he will repeat everything the s the speaker will say. Then German and Czech ASR. So be ready for it. And we need the segmentation workers,, punctuation and segmentation for English, German and Czech. And are we going to use sentence-level machine translation or subsentence-level? So, the subsentence-level, it means that the MT is prepared to start in middle of sentence and, for example, translate on windows of for 40 or 50 last words.",
            "Maybe I should clarify what the segmentation workers actually do.",
            "Yes.",
            "The existence of the segmentation workers does not mean that it's that translation is performed on sentence level. The segmentation workers. Segmentation is not the right word for them. They insert punctuation, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "They remove some aspects of,, of speech. So some of the. It can't remove everything. But some repetitions or discontinuities, -",
            "Aha.",
            "Are removed. But they do transmit partial sentences, And it's and that was originally what was the problem on the last event, Of while we had the additional segmenter.",
            "These do use the so-called resending protocol, where, When more words of the sentence are available, The partial sentences will be transmitted to the MT. So, senten so, translation is done at at a subsentence level,",
            "Okay.",
            "But they know the context throughout,, the sentence, so no words from the past sentences, obviously.",
            "Okay, so the ORGANIZATION3's MT is done on subsentence level. The last week I tried to update. Or this week. I tried to train our English to Czech MT on subsentence level too. So, maybe we'll later we can talk on technical details: Which to use, or which window size, and -",
            "It's not a matter of window size. The way we have trained our MT is, we take the training set and you just,, cut off the end of the sentences, because -",
            "Aha.",
            "You don't get parts from the middle of the sentence, You always get the sentence from the beginning to some part in the middle.",
            "Okay. Do you? Okay.",
            "That's that's how the that's how the segmentation works.",
            "Aha.",
            "It always come from of the sentence from the start of the sentence to as far as it as we are right now.",
            "Yes.",
            "As far as the always gotten.",
            "Yeah.",
            "What are you doing if. Are you doing that on the source and the target? And where. How do you decide that some reordering happening?",
            "That is a good question. That would be a good question for PERSON15, who has developed the system. Unfortunately, he is no longer here, So I can I can ask I didn't develop that system. I imagine there is some alignment model from SMT monitor that decides where to cut off. And yes, it is done on assertion target.",
            "Of sentence and missing end. Okay, so, will we need, will we have all the MT workers subsentence? If yes, then we won't need the buffer workers, which wait until the sentence is ready and then send it to MT, and we can skip this completely.",
            "So,, the systems the MT systems I've trained so far have all been sentence-level. I'm not -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Not sure if we'll be able to train subsentence-level systems in time.",
            "Okay. And F PERSON2, can you run the s the buffer worker for f subsentence to sentence-level?",
            "I don't think we can.",
            "Tra.",
            "The thing is, the ORGANIZATION3 has, at the same time as the VAT members happening, has as an important demo. Most of our capacities are used there, -",
            "Okay.",
            "Which means that ORGANIZATION3 will not be able to run the display website for the event.",
            "And we can provide the usual translation workers,, At least the ones that you wrote there, -",
            "But we would prefer to keep as much of the capacities -",
            "Okay.",
            "As possible.",
            "So, we need to somehow th to hack it some wow somehow. Maybe to filter all the sentences which don't don't end, And translate only the sentences which are complete, which end. And then send it to the MT worker.",
            "I believe, incomplete sentences, that are marked as such when they're sent to the MT workers, so whatev however you program your MT worker, it can check whether the sentence -",
            "Yes.",
            "Is incomplete and not translated.",
            "Okay. So -",
            "Sorry guys. But it's, if it's just a matter of,,, power, let's say,, which has to be,, taken for your important demo. We can also,, be available to perform an installation of the punctuation and segmentation worker on our server if you help us to let it run it, And in order to provide it as test worker,, on the mediator.",
            "We can think about that, but it's it's also a matter of.",
            "Okay, of co of course, I of course,, I perfectly understand that it's an asset, let's say. But if which there's something we can do in order to help you on th, this thing, we are available, of course.",
            "Thank you.",
            "We are quite busy right now in preparing for this -",
            "No.",
            "For this template.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Demo at ORGANIZATION3, so it's it's not just a a matter of process or power, it's also a matter of manpower, and -",
            "Okay, okay. I understand.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so, I was. We will definitely need an integration of PROJECT3 e MT or PROJECT3 server to ORGANIZATION8 platform, so I suggest to add these functionality to the integration, And, for example, to ignore incomplete sentences and don't translate them and wait for for the sentence-level MT from PERSON4. Okay? Does anyone agree?",
            "Yes.",
            "We've also been thinking whether we can have some incremental functionality,, which returns which has its own policy bout return translation by common input. What we one thing I haven't quite figured out is, like when you say you're submitting this multiple times. Are you submitting partial sentences? Is the next thing that is being submitted just the remainder of the sentence, Or is the full sentence that I can submit it? How does how does the - Sequential output start?",
            "As far as I understand, the sentence is always transmitted from the start of the sentence, But I've also linked,, the paper that we published,, at Interspeech, That describes at least part of the process.",
            "Okay. Thanks.",
            "Yeah. So, what is this? Low. Okay. S. No multisource. Yeah. We. This is what PERSON8's wrote us. Where the t. We might have some experimental multit, multisource system, but it's not. Not necessary. Yeah.",
            "So, for clarification, multisource means the system accepts multiple input streams at the same time?",
            "Yes. mul,, input from multiple languages, or f either from multiple languages, or 2 s different sources from one language.",
            "Is that supported by the mediator? Can you do that?",
            "I don't now.",
            "It's not yet supported, but we have to plan it, actually, because it's. A well-known requirement.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay. And is it going to be available f until June, PERSON11?",
            "No, sorry.",
            "Okay, no problem. Not in ORGANIZATION8 mediator in June. So, we need to then we need to decide who is going to prepare which MT which translation. So, thanks PERSON4 that he indicated the languages.",
            "Yeah, so this would be a single multi-target system, which does translation out of English. So I currently have a system that does translation, Into all of the ORGANIZATION7 languages, -",
            "Mm-hmm. But that's probably not optimal, That's probably trying to do too many languages in one system.",
            "Yes.",
            "Or I will train up the system that just covers,, the target languages we need for this event.",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Great. And in and PERSON2, in the mediator I already saw some some of your MT systems. It was into Italian, Spanish, maybe French.",
            "We have systems into German, English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, I believe.",
            "Yes. So can you write which of the systems do you have? like here? You have English to French, right? or i was it German to French?",
            "We ha I think we have all directions within within at least 5 languages, we have all directions. I don't know about Portuguese.",
            "Yeah. So please, if you have English to French, or English to German, or any of these directions, write it here, And we will know that we don't need - And then. Yeah. Yeah, we need to decide who is going to integrate PROJECT3 MT into ORGANIZATION8. S. I think this is either us, the ORGANIZATION5, or ORGANIZATION4, because we are going to use PROJECT3, right?",
            "Yes, we will be using PROJECT3 server,, Or maybe a wrapper around PROJECT3 server.",
            "Yes.",
            "Currently, we have no experience of rooting,,, the workers for,, the ORGANIZATION8 platform. Like if we had if we had an example for a different translation system, maybe we could adapt to. Well, I would -",
            "Well, should GitHub repo. There are the example. But please feel write me, so we can have,, a one-to-one discussion over support on this topic. Of course, we will provide you all the documentation required.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, -",
            "You're welcome.",
            "There is I can show you there is. ExampleClient, SMT yeah, this is 4 clients. There should be. Yeah. Backend SMT. This is the way how to start.",
            "Oh, okay, I missed that one. One minute? Okay.",
            "Yeah. So can you do it? Because,, there is some sign.",
            "We. We can try. Yeah, hopefully, it will work out with a support form. PERSON11?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I will link the GitHub page to our,, MT worker systems. Of course, the s the series code, it's still a from being a deployed system, but if you're interested, you can use that, It already has integration of 3 different,, MT systems. It should not be that difficult to integrate another one. If you want to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Do that.",
            "Yeah. So, this is perfect, that PERSON4 is going to do it, because some C programming is necessary to do it right now. I'm not a real expert in it. So thank you, PERSON4.",
            "Okay, no problem.",
            "Yeah. Then we need some lifestream selection, cause at the conference we will have,, several options for several sources of German interpreter or German interpreters, or source, or respeakers, And we need we need another skilled interpreter who will change which stream is going to be the main one, depending on the quality of the sources. And this is something between worker and client. We need to we need the graphical user interface, or some interface to connect the sources into MT or mediators, or s etcetera. Do you understand what do we need? What is this?",
            "Or should I repeat?",
            "No. If okay, I try to repeat it in order to check if I correctly understood.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "You need some kind. Probably on the presentation platform, let's say. You need,, a kind of,, graphical user interface in order to select the stream sources for,, the transcription output.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. It's it's planned to be like this.",
            "Okay. And this is going to be for, this is one session for the organizers who distribute it for others, right? It's it's not for the it's not that every user can use or can choose their f their i their output.",
            "No. No, no, no, no. Of course, it will be protect by credentials.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, s there wil. One organizer is going to control it for all for the whole audience. Okay, so. So PERSON11 is going to prepare it?",
            "Well,, it will be part of the presentation platform, and -",
            "Okay.",
            "When we are ready, we will also share with you,, functional requirements and the word documentation, in order to check altogether.",
            "Yeah, great. So, we are moving to presentation platform, the next point. The platform must. Yeah. Yeah, thi these are some requirements what the presentation platform will need. That It must jump on available session if we restart the EB client.",
            "Okay, this is actually,,, a reasonable request,",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But, probably, it will not be,, ready as functionality for June. However, I take a note and we will introduce you in functional -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Requirements.",
            "Okay. Probably not in June. Yeah. PERSON8 promised to do video grabbing and streaming, in addition to global subtitles for the main screen. So for the June event, we need some version of presentation client, or worker or something, And he can add it to the screen. He already has some scripts to it. Yeah. Fallback needed. Okay, so please take this note, PERSON11.",
            "Yep. Well, actually, I'm not,,, so experienced in video streaming and so on, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "But PERSON5 told me that everything should work until,, everything is streamed using HLS protocol, -",
            "H -",
            "Which is the usual, streaming protocol for video. Then if -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Slides are streamed as video, let's say, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Should work.",
            "Yeah. But, of course, when we,, have all the requirements and the architecture are ready, we can check again everything together, In order to check if we missed something, or if there's something more required, or if we completely misunderstood something.",
            "Okay. I think, for June, we need either Website which shows the subtitles as they are going on, or it can be command-line application. And we write -",
            "But -",
            "The s the script to put the browser window to the to the screen with presentation.",
            "Well, actually, it's,, the idea is to prepare a Web application.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Since, I'm going through the literal documentation and the requirements are both: User have to,, ch, have assess to stream slides or stream video and subtitles on their personal devices, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, of course, when it's all web-based, I think that it will work well also full screen on the main screen.",
            "Yeah. Okay, perfect.",
            "We, actually, I'm not really experienced in such,,, technical data, but,, my opinion should work.",
            "Yes. Yes. The next question is that whether if we are going to the English ASR adaptation based on documents provided by participants. I think that we. PERSON8 already wrote an e-mail that we're not going to do it, right? This is question to ORGANIZATION3. Are you there, PERSON2?",
            "And so for the a demo this month, we will not be able to do that.",
            "We are,, -",
            "Okay.",
            "Already our ASR workers for our own demo.",
            "Can you remind me what is the event in June?",
            "It's it's on the last weekend of June, 28th until the 30th of June.",
            "And that is? what event is that?",
            "This event is meeting of maybe 15 members of ORGANIZATION7, and they're going to discuss something on,, the value-added tags. And it will be in, They are going to speak in English. Or all the participants from like 5 countries or something like this. And w and we can we can,, interpret them, anyway.",
            "So there may have been some miscommunication. Then what is the event taking place at,, 16th of May? Then.",
            "The event on 16 of May? There's not going any event on this, I think. It's next week, 16. Yes, because our demo is next week -",
            "Aha.",
            "And I understood that the event was in fact that week. Serious miscommunication.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Next week there is another call, on next Friday at 10 AM, So we need to discuss, probably, progress on all these tasks. Yeah, but I do not now any other event.",
            "I see in that case, some dates may. So, for next month,, we may be able to do some adaptation. It will probably just involved adding some words to language model.",
            "Yes.",
            "Without actual,, voice from the speaker we couldn't actually train and adapt the ASR.",
            "Yeah, okay. So. So I write, Yes, you will you will you will try. Yeah, and similar question for adaptation of machine translation. The Ch the ORGANIZATION5 can get some data related to the domain that will be discussed at the workshop from TAUS. And the question is whether we're interested. This is for PERSON4. And if yes, for which language pairs?",
            "This is this parallel data you can get? or is this monolingual data?",
            "I don't now, probably both. Or -",
            "If it's parallel data, we can use it for fine-tuning, I guess.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Monolingual data, I'm not so sure we what we do with that.",
            "Yeah. Parallel yes, monolingual no. And for which language pairs? I guess for all?",
            "Yeah, any of the pairs _",
            "Okay. Out of English. For all. And. Okay. And the last question from PERSON8 is: Which metholo methodology to use for selecting the final models? Because we may have several ASR models, several MT models, And we need and they will be adapted to different domains, or they will have different quality, different robustness to foreign accents, And there will be it will be,, necessary to switch them online on the conference, based on some metric, either either by some expert who will switch it. Who will look at the outputs and switch it online or use some test sets. So what do you suggest? My suggestion is that we're probably not going to solve this problem, because we will happy that we will have at least one system for all functionality. But he probably. For that which test sets to use? Like Ted Talks, or create our own ones? If we're able to get parallel data for TAUS, Then, of course, we could hold out some of that -",
            "Data? Data from what? I didn't understand one word.",
            "So in the previous Python, You're saying we can get,, VAT data from TAUS.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, if there's if there's parallel data, we can use that for the MT test sets.",
            "Okay. Yes. Parallel from TAUS. Yeah, this is good idea.",
            "I'm a bit worried that we might not be able to decide it too early, because,, Even if we have some test set and then we measure translation quality on that,, there will also be some interactions like with incomplete inputs that we'll have to,, See how these in, different modules interact, And how robust, for example, machine trans different machine translation systems we'll have are to that.",
            "There might also be difference in t differences in terms of lack that might be relevant for the conference to make the decision.",
            "Yes. Yeah. So, thank you everyone. I think we are done. Or does anyone have any questions or comments? or anything?",
            "No. If not that a. Okay, so thank you everyone, and s let's call again next Friday at te 10 AM.",
            "Okay, thank you so much.",
            "Alright, thank you, bye.",
            "Yeah. Thank you, goodbye.",
            "Bye.",

            "Hi.",
            "Hello. Ok, O-PERSON11 will join from, for a while, but he, he has to,, leave soon. So, I guess,, we'll first,,, summarize, was discussed regarding the PROJECT7 last week because I think he was paying most of the attention, since he was discussing it, actually, with the others.",
            "Hi, I'm here, yeah, I - s-sorry for the delay. Yeah, so, l I'm overloaded as, as always, but it's maybe, much worse. It's, it's getting worse every, every day. So,,, a while I'm here, I would like, to first apologize to PERSON8 for forgetting him,, forgetting about him in the last call, like, when I was,, mentioning the people.",
            "No problem at all.",
            "I was scanning up and down the participants lists, but for some reaso, n –. You,, so, that's,, stupid. At the same time, I think that,, you saw the energy like, I was really surprised to see that ORGANIZATION1 has indeed active people on the job. And I think that, well, maybe any everything can in the end go like, ash tray, maybe, maybe they won't,, put it in the browser in any form, and they will kill it for management,, reasons at any stage. But,, while there was the energy, I really felt,, that,, if we like, supported them, if they kept working this way,,, they, the PROJECT4 could make a difference. Like, there indeed could be a, a built-in translation system in every browser on every desktop,, in several years from now. So, I think it would be,, great to,, to like, contribute, well, actively and, and make sure that everything gets in. We are on the side of that,, obviously with our outbound translation,. But still,, like,, you can easily hit forms when browsing,, the web in the wrong,, in, in foreign language. So, our exercises make,, sense there. And also, there are,, other,, tasks where we can help like, just,,, validating it for our languages,, which does include Portuguese. That sh - That definitely would help the,, the project. So, I'd like, to like, highlight this energy that I saw there. And, I think that we should try to make use of that. Because imagine, ORGANIZATION3 being mentioned in credits of, of ORGANIZATION1,, some years from now. And that would just amazing. So, that's,, the, the main message that I had from the ORGANIZATION1 meeting. The other message was,, like, it's, it's all than up to you, so, to say to, to check that,,, the,, PROJECT7 that they have agree on and is not documented in the document,, in, in the share document,, is in line with what we are going to, to provide for,, the,, for the form filling. So,, so, far, we are running very much independently. We have to have finish our experiments and know watch,, the user needs. And what the user can actually,, make use of,, but,, at the end of,, the, this at the end of the project, we will have to have some subset integrated. And it can be as simple as just back-translation, nothing more than pew, like, playing back translation. But if we find anything useful,, like, the paraphrases, than we have to,, have the paraphrasing,, sub-module,, ready for them to, to somehow package it and send it. So, that would be a multilingual model,, under the hood that go,, the,, and a little, like, loop that goes there and back,, into a number of languages and,, shows the paraphrases. If we,, do something further complicated, such as the PROJECT3,, exploration, then again, we have to make sure that the PROJECT7 that they have agreed upon is sufficient for our,, thing. So, please,, always keep in mind this, and keep checking what they're doing. There is one thing,, about PROJECT3. So, so, far the PROJECT3,, as they were discussed,, they, they were like, brought,, to the discussion,, as part of our, work-package,, the outbound translation. But,, the actual use of the PROJECT3 was totally without the outbound translation task in mind. It was only,, to offer the user some alternative translations of,, words and, and sentences on the web page that the user bro, is browsing. So,, there is some risk of confusion. They may think that,, like, we are dealing with this, outbound translation, sorry, the – with this PROJECT3 navigation. We're not, obviously, we are only,,, focusing on navigating,, the PROJECT3 in the language that the user doesn't speak. The,, the PROJECT3,, as they discussed,, that was for the user,, to, to see a better version of, the input, where the user understands the output, the user understands item in the PROJECT3, but doesn't understand,, the input, or doesn't understand it sufficiently enough. So, this - There is –. Some risk of confusion and we have to,, clarify it, if we see that the confusion is,, happening. Yeah. But that's, that's about it. And,, from,, from the PERSON4 point of view, we need to be sure that the like, the more complicated call is sufficient for that. That we are getting the PROJECT3, and that we have a way of, like,, s using this for our purposes. So, if we need PROJECT5 with modifications, which are the constraints and, and so on, then we need to make sure that this version of PROJECT5 is the one that is going to be,, like, shipped with,, that and that we can access those,, extra features with the PROJECT7. It's too early for now,, to ask for that, because we don't know if it helps,, at all,, so,, and we don't know what exactly is our PROJECT7 to these extra features of PROJECT5, because well, we don't have - We, we don't use PROJECT5 yet for these experiments. But we need to keep that,, in mind,. So, that's,, that's the high-level overview that I just,, wanted to, to give and that's it, so. Thank you. And I'll, I'll keep listening for while, and then I'll disappear.",
            "So, okay,. So, first things first, as you might have noticed,, we were invited to the gol global PROJECT4 Slack. So, it's, it's good to keep, keep a track of new conversations there, regarding the implementation. And that's basically everything general. So, we can move to the sub-tasks. So, how, how about PROJECT1? How's, how is it going? Are we getting more data from ORGANIZATION2 or, or no, no updates there?",
            "Well, actually we'll be stopping it for today and tomorrow, because of the outage,. And there is - There were - I mean - In total we have eighteen hundred OK segments. Which is, I guess, OK, but we need more.",
            "And,, I started working with the paper. I just - I already wrote several sub-sections. I think it's going well, but, at one point, we'll need to come up with something, which is going to make the paper more original. Like, which is going to distinguish -",
            "OK.",
            "It from the 2B paper.",
            "And that's my biggest fear right now. But, -",
            "OK, so, so. Go - go on.",
            "So, OK. The last week, I, I was, I was working on the evaluation for like, a,, interface for human evaluation or the, like, environment for human evaluation of the translations. So, yeah, I come up with some website. And,, currently, yeah, I'm, I still need to, because I'm working with, only with some toy examples. So, so, I need to process,, the,, the logs from, from the PROJECT1 that I have o. I like -",
            "OK,, so.",
            "Oh, you - you are doing that, or?",
            "Yes. I, I'm doing it actually because I, I already wrote a section. If you take a look at the paper, I've wrote about the section about the first variables and how we pick them. So, at this point, I just have the like, the list of sentence or inputs which we want to have annotated.",
            "And so, I imagine it like, I just give you this, this file, where every line is, is some input which is annotated.",
            "OK, so, in the, in the original, in the format that you asked me to send you, the, the JSON format.",
            "What do you mean?",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "Wha wait,, what format?",
            "Sorry, sorry?",
            "What format, I'm not sure.",
            "Like, you asked me,, like, to –. When I - like, this environment, or this front-end is working with back-cues as well. So, you asked me what the format -",
            "Oh yeah, OK, so, I'll prepare this and send it to you.",
            "Yes, because, I, I thought that I, I'm going to prepare this, but currently -",
            "Oh, OK.",
            "Yeah but if you want to prepare it, you know. Like, jus we have just -",
            "I mean, did you do any significant work on it?",
            "Not yet, because,, like, until Friday, I was working on the front-end. And since then,, I'm doing some review on -",
            "Okay, well then, it's probably best that I just make it and send it to you.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "Yeah, so. And, OK. So, I contact,, I contacted PERSON5 and,, she announced the annotators about the -",
            "New like, annotating campaign by PROJECT4. And, so, what else. So, PERSON6 contacted also, other partners, that they can contribute to the paper.",
            "Yeah, there's ten authors of this paper right now.",
            "Yeah, OK, but. It's, is normal in,, in physics. You know to have like, thousands of authors.",
            "OK.",
            "Why, why not to do so in, in the, like, the Computer Science.",
            "So, If I may cut in, I, I have two questions. One is,, you, you mentioned a new annotation campaign. So, so, what is this exactly related? Is it going to process the collected segments, or?",
            "Yeah, like, we are like –. We have two - In PROJECT1 there are two stations, two stages of interaction with, with the human users or participants, or annotators. And the first one it's running in, by ORGANIZATION2.",
            "OK.",
            "So, those people are working with the PROJECT1 application. And then,, so, so, we are,, asking them for their confidence, but we still need to find out what's the quality of the produce out what's the quality of the produced translations.",
            "OK.",
            "And this, this needs to be evaluated,, like, a standard evaluation of,, human translations.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I, I, I do, I do remember now. Yeah, I, I understand.",
            "OK.",
            "So.",
            "So, that –. Sorry, so, that's the campaign. And this a this a,,, this is the, and, and this is split into,, like, our side end the easto Estonian side, because we have like, two target languages. And I already communicated with Estonia, s, and they told me, OK that I would just need to inform them about the,, annotating,, environment and the guidelines. So, I still need to write some guidelines in English. Yeah, but until tomorrow, I have a lot of work with annotating,, sorry, with reviewing papers for coreference workshops.",
            "But from Wednesday I can work up on it again.",
            "Ok, so, o. Ok, so,, another question is since we - are we still expecting more segments? So, the question is,, I did, didn't get,, how are we handling the outage today? So, PERSON6 is -",
            "To, to inform the ORGANIZATION2 people and I informed them. And they told, or PERSON1,, responded that he's going to,, just add a warning to the,, to the site.",
            "Well, we are not sure, whether it's a blocking note or a non-blocking note so, anyway -",
            "Yeah, we are not sure, but -",
            "I just put like, a note saying that it is unavailable at the moment and I guess.",
            "Ok, so, so, hopefully they will understand it, and nobody will like, participate during this time, this period.",
            "And,, question about, at,, like, l yeah. We are starting like, process the, the s like, contributions that we have so, far, we have collected so, far,. And - but it doesn't mean that we are not collecting them, like, more of them, so. The first stage of an annotation is not finished yet,. ORGANIZATION2 is still,, like,, PERSON9 d replied like, in, in the end of the last week that,, the maybe he will again t poke the, the participants to, to do it more or, or other -",
            "I, I mean, having, for example, two thousand, and or two thousand, and hundred, OK stimuli would be, like, good. But I have a question for PERSON3, whether like, when are we stay starting the, the quality annotations, like. If we start them, then we quit the first stage, or we keep the first stage rolling and then just won't have quality annotations for some of the replies. What do you say? Or did you understand my question.",
            "So, so, so, the questions was, whether we should,, finish the first stage before we start the second stage, or?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry, I don't get the -",
            "Yeah, or how do you plan this.",
            "Yeah, yes.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know that we, we maybe we have a different opinion on this. And like, I don't think it would harm so much, if we run this in parallel.",
            "OK.",
            "Because most we have collected so, far, most of the stimulis, or most of the contributions. So, I think we can start -",
            "I, I, I mean. It's okay by me, but we'll just to –. Like, we would have part of data annotated in this way, but I guess that's OK.",
            "But we can,, then, like, we can ask, ok, so, so, we can,, put the checkpoint,, like, what's the first part of the annotation, leave it to the second,, st for, for these annotators of, or human evaluators.",
            "And then we can ask them again to annotate the second part, if, if we have some tim still some time.",
            "OK. I mean, we will have to write that we, we except this possibility of bias, but I guess it's OK.",
            "Yeah, I know like.I still.",
            "I - Perhaps I'm worrying just too much, I guess it's OK.",
            "Yeah, maybe we will - I, I still cannot see the like,, so much bias there, but, -",
            "Yea, yeah, yeah, I mean, there is potentially, but I don't know what exactly, so. I guess it's OK.",
            "But do you mean bias on w. OK, so, we can discuss this in, separately, because -",
            "Yeah, yeah, OK.",
            "Maybe you aren't, others are no longer interested in this, so.",
            "OK, so.I think that -",
            "So, the, so, the final,, message from this is that,, like, works on PROJECT1, are like, progressing more than it has progressed like,, like, three weeks ago, or, like, yeah. So, so, now it's –. We are progressing, yeah.",
            "OK. Good to hear that, so, can we move to the next topic, or is there anything else? OK, so, let's, le-let's move to PROJECT2, right.",
            "Yeah, yes.",
            "Or did you wanted to say something?",
            "Yes, here, it's not so much progress,, like.",
            "Like, co slowly I am still running,, or training more and more systems. And,, yeah, I need to somehow after everything is done.",
            "And then I have time to, to do this, I have to visualize,, like, the, the learning curves,, learning curves from, from the pre-training, a learning curves from the, from the fine tuning. And,, to see, w-what are - what this curves are saying. Like, I have some ideas now, like, or, or the or the first observation.",
            "I'm still not sure if it's the, if it's true, because it really depends how many,, iterations were performed during the retraining.",
            "And,, I think that,, the difference between the, between the normally back-translated data -",
            "Uh-hm.",
            "And the, the back-translated data, that we called para or paraphrases, which are like,, which are forced to be as different from the original so, r, original translations.",
            "As possible. So, different, like, using this data, it helps when we don't have,, enough monolingual data to be translated normally. I - and to be like, added - To, to, like, like, back-translate the data.",
            "So, but I have still to - This is just, like, my preliminary observation from the table.",
            "And I think it will be,, it will be mol more clear or clearer if I,, when I just plot it into learning curves and see how it actually depends on the - In what way I stop the pre-training and what iteration.",
            "I think it really depends on this factor.",
            "OK,.",
            "We discussed this with PERSON2. So, what should we, what should we do with, with, with it next. Yeah, and so, this is the work on,, augment.",
            "-tation. Augmentation, right?",
            "Data augmentation. And,, like, for a month, or more, I haven't done like, on real or true PROJECT2.",
            "I haven't done much on this, or, or nothing. So, I think I, I should maybe finish this as soon as possible and start to concentrate on the real, mal PROJECT2.",
            "Because, yeah, no, I think, already in the - We have, we, we have not been ask for this thing during the last meeting, or the plenary meeting.",
            "But I think they will be interested how this multiple or multiple rephrasings will be employed in the, in the -",
            "OK.",
            "Like, PROJECT1, no, not PROJECT1. In the PROJECT4, in, in, integration in the, in the plug-in for Firefox.",
            "Oh yeah, it, it's true that we have to somehow,, figure out, how to - Well the question is,, so, we are, we are, there will be some communication with the users. An, and the user has to provide us the alternatives, right, the alternative input. So, so, we need to ask the PROJECT7 people to kind of help us design the PROJECT7 in the way that that it supports this kind of funk functionality, right. But other than that, like, for example, if we provide the additional sources ourselves, for example, by paraphrasing, or back translation or anything without,, the user knowing we might avoid this? Or actually, now that I think about it, even, even if we create the additional sources ourself, we would probably want to send them to the user so, he, he knows how the translation was created, right. I'm, I'm not sure, like.",
            "I'm not getting it now, but,.",
            "OK, I will take note, that, that, that's definitely a thing that we might, we should mention to the, to the PROJECT7 people that this kind of functionality might be helpful. I get that there's still chance that since the, the PROJECT7 will probably support the, simple input that, that we can just,, cheat it in a way, and, and use the symbol, single input, support. And support, and, and split the multiple sources by, by some special symbol, or, or something like, that, but I'm, I'm, I'm sure right now.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
            "OK, so, that's, that's good.",
            "Like, my original idea from mul PROJECT2 translation was that,, yeah. But it would,. My original idea was that the, the, the additional translation,, sorry, additional rephrasings of,, rephrasings of the source text would somehow,, make the, make the translation more precise. Or, or you will, you will just add and if you add more and more,, rephrasings,, the, the translation would change. And this would, this could be done by, yeah, but the translation would have to somehow remember the state.",
            "OK, so, now - Forget about it. We just - Yeah.",
            "Okay. Sorry.",
            "This needs to be dealt with also on the AP sid PROJECT7 side. Cause if we want to like, provide them with more one translation, they need to know this.",
            "OK, yeah, yeah. I think that, that's the, that's the most, most pressing thing right now, like, to really,, think it through. Like, what would we might need to,, like, what we, what we require for this from, from the PROJECT7 side and, and tell them the - as soon as possible, so, they can properly design the, - Well, the PROJECT7, right.",
            "Yeah and then. On our side, OK, when we somehow specify these, then we have to –. Yeah, I can work on it alone, but it would be grateful, if somebody could help me with this PROJECT2 will. And I think, PERSON7, you, you told.",
            "Yeah, yes, definitely, definitely, you can count on me because I'm basically also, assigned to this, so, so. Yeah, so, feel free to, to bother me or, or, or ask me for,.",
            "Like, help and, and s things like, that.",
            "And maybe I have one more comment to what PERSON11 was saying.",
            "What was it. Yeah, about the integration and, -",
            "If we want to integrate,, so, far, like, f like, from the preliminary results of PROJECT1 experiment, we know that back-translation is the best signal for the users that -",
            "Yeah. But also, the paraphrases, also, paraphrases somehow like, there are some high, somehow helpful a bit.",
            "And, so, if we want to,, integrate the paraphrasing system, like, one, that we ha we are using now in the PROJECT1, I think it isn't, or, not,, not a lot of work, but,, substantial work on the site of somehow,, making the model smaller and work on the CPU. Because now we are using the implementation of,,, PERSON10.",
            "And it's working, it's working on GPUs in two steps. So, like, a PROJECT2, multitarget,, translation, and -",
            "Yeah, so, I don't think it will be like,, easy task to,, just to change it to, to, to work sufficiently good,.",
            "And I think this is something that,.",
            "So, so, you're talking about the paraphrasing in, in PROJECT1, right?",
            "Sorry?",
            "You're talking about the paraphrasing in PROJECT1, right now.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, OK. So, is it implemented in PROJECT5, or.",
            "No.",
            "OK.",
            "This is like, this implementation by PERSON10 is done in, in PROJECT6.",
            "OK. So, we - I guess the best thing would be to ask PERSON10, whether he can reproduce it in PROJECT5, that would be good start. And then we can discuss -",
            "But PERSON10 is - PERSON10,, employed,, on PROJECT4 still, can we ask him to, to do anything more for, for this project?",
            "I'm, I'm kinda asking PERSON11. PERSON11, PERSON10 is still employed?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK.Yes.He's still employed, so, we can ask him for that.",
            "OK.",
            "Can you hear me? Oh.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.I can hear you, yeah.",
            "Yeah, definitely, I, I would start with asking PERSON10. I'm not sure how, how complicated the system is or whether, whether it, it is currently supported by PROJECT5, or, like. But we definitely need at least the information was needs to be implemented in PROJECT5 to make it work. And,, yeah, basically that's it. And then we can -",
            "Like, the problem for me is there, that I think that,, if we want to do the same optimization that was done for standard translation system,, like, those - The pipeline that I also, tried and it was pain, yea pain, really painful and I did not finish it,, it needs to be done for 4Ds. And it would be much complicated, because it's not only one, like, one source language and one target language. But there are multiple,, languages on the both sides and -",
            "Yeah, but, the, it might be that it's -",
            "So, I am quite, I'm quite worried about that, about that PERSON10 would do this because I don't think PERSON10 is,, like, really in, into this project, and I have - He's, he's working well or fine but, yeah, I have the experience with the previous work, and I don't think - If we want to finish it, it needs,, so, me, simply more work, and more time to, to do this.",
            "So, I think I think the thing what, what is important is to ask him as soon as possible. I will try it this week. And the, the important thing is to get the, the description how it actually works, how his implementation PROJECT6 works. And, like, it's - I don I don't expect, if, if what we need to implement some additional features into PROJECT5 NMT, that, that it will be done by PERSON10. But, you know, we can, we can ask PERSON12, whether, whether he can perform his implementation, like, how much time he things it would b. Like, I think we do have people that can handle it. But right now, I, I just, like, would like, to know,, like, the differences, or what is missing for this to be,, done in PROJECT5, right. That, that's, that's the only thing I'm interesting right now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, oh, and the main we need to figure out -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think that should be -",
            "I'm not mentioning it. I'm not saying that we have to figure out now, what, what the solution. But I'm just mentioning it because this one of the things we, we need to deliver something.",
            "And the like, back tr like, from the PROJECT1 experiment,, back translation is the best thing, but is easy. And we need to deliver something that is more advanced, -",
            "The first thing to come is,, paraphrases.",
            "And,, yeah, and, we s we need to think about it, who will,, who will like, transform the solution, solution that can work on, can be run CPU.",
            "Yes, I, I understand it. The, the thing is that,, before we can actually,, split the work between us, I need to know like, what the actual process is that, that he does for, you know, like, for to paraphrasing. I, I have just so, me, some shallow ei idea right now. So, that's, that's what I'm talking about. So, I will, I will ask him about the details and I ca. Yeah, we can definitely discuss it next week.",
            "Like, what are our options. Yeah. But good, good thing you mention it, because it, that's definitely important,, but I think yeah, that, that should be it for PROJECT2 right now, right? So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Can we - We can get some brief overview on the PROJECT3 progress. PERSON8?",
            "Well, let's talk about PROJECT3. What I, what I did then since our last,, talk, was trying to have some results, any results, just to have some idea about what,, we have with these experiments. So,, I implemented the split you suggested, which is,, taking twenty percent of, of the references as constraint providers, and the rest as references for evaluation.",
            "And then, then, I used the idea, the simpler idea, which is just taking one references and selecting the tokens,, the most important tokens, and,, using it as constraints in an incremental way. And, and generated the, the, the output in, in Czech, so. Now I was in no wise in the blue score obtained with different constraints.",
            "And it doesn't follow a pattern. So, it bends on each case and it, it's interesting because,, maybe I was expecting that in all cases when we add,, more constraints, have better blue score, and it's not the case for all the examples. So,, we have, in some cases, it's words. As a, as we add constraints, it improves, but in some cases, it just drops the blue score. So, for me, at least it's important to have this initial, huh, result, only po, using positive constraints. Because now I have some idea of, of what to do and maybe what think over that. And, and well, about the word-alignment, which is the, is the second part of his of, of creating,, creating this constraints, combination of, of different concerns from different references. And I didn't implement it in yet, but I'm, I'm, I checked, already, what, what PERSON3 provided. So, I'll start working on that now and as soon as possible have the results if this combination of, of constraints as well. Regarding the PROJECT5, I didn't, I didn't look at that, because,, I was trying to have this initial results and it took all my time and. So, so.",
            "Yeah, this, this.",
            "But maybe, PERSON12 may say something about that because, or I can help you or something, because I didn't, I didn't do much on, on PROJECT5.",
            "Uh-hm, this is, this is fine,, definitely, we can look at the results tomorrow.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just please me, please send me a link with the, with the, o the data, or the results, so, so, I can at least briefly look at it before the discussion. Yeah. It seems fine. Like, so, so, just a question about the alignments. So, so, did you run into any trouble there or is it just in pros progress right now.",
            "No, yeah, I'm, I'm, I didn't, I didn't try yet to, to, to use the models provided by PERSON3.",
            "OK.",
            "So, I will do this today, because I was just making sure that the results are,, okay. So, if I, I was checking if there, there was any, there were any errors in my implementation. So, it took me some time, but today I will start that, this afternoon.",
            "OK.",
            "Actually, we have so, me, some limitation on the server, right?",
            "What do you mean? What limitation?",
            "Oh, the ow. Not limitation, it's a the cluster will be out of order, right?",
            "Oh, yeah, you're right about that. So,, it should be in a hour and a half.",
            "OK.",
            "That's that, according to schedule, right?",
            "Yeah, eight, six PM, right?",
            "Yes, six PM, so, yeah, that's, that's, yeah. Ninety minutes, basically. Eighty now. So, yeah.",
            "Yeah, just make sure.",
            "Yeah, so, you can, you can try just,, preparing the alignment crypt or the pipeline. And,, I'm not sure whether you can make it until the outage, but,, you know. You, you can try to have, have it ready, so, you can run it after, after the servers are back on-line, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And,, what about, what to do, when there's the outage. Well you can, you can try, try reading so, me, related papers, or, or make some self-study.",
            "Yeah, sure, sure. No problem about that.",
            "That's always the back-up plan. So, yeah, to here -",
            "I must do right, I have, have some here. So, there's no problem.",
            "OK, so, yeah. Sounds good. I'm, I'm really looking forward to the, to the, to discussing the results tomorrow, so.",
            "Oh yeah.",
            "So, is there anything else? Anything yo like, anyone wants to add to the discussion or are we done?",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "Yeah, I. I had a look at the branch of the PROJECT5 with the paraphraser, it's basically not usable for us, it's very simple. He just filters out hypothesis beams with, that contain, tokens, which are in the original sentence, but not in the paraphrase. So, he just filters beams to get different results. It's - So, that's like,, I'm not sure, that, that will help us in a way.",
            "OK, but so.",
            "It's just very simple and,, yeah, so, I,, had a look at the, at the FAIRSEC implementation.",
            "And I will try to reimplement it in PROJECT5 but -",
            "The logic is not too complicated, but the implementation probably will be.",
            "Yeah, yeah.OK, so, so.",
            "Yeah, that's, surprisingly.",
            "Yeah, just, keep, keep, keep us updated, how is it going, also, good thing that you reminded, or spoke, because, yeah I'm, I'm adding,, section to the, to the minutes. And yeah definitely, I will keep a, let's, let's keep track of, of your implementation progress.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Definitely good idea.",
            "And if you need any help, I can, I can try to help, anyway, OK.",
            "OK, OK, like, l. Right now, I'm just going, you know, basically line by line with implementation FAIRSEC and trying to figure out how to do this thing in PROJECT5 yeah.",
            "OK, so,, maybe, maybe p. PERSON12,, if you, if you have some question regarding the FAIRSEC, I may try to look into it and maybe I will be - My –. I can be helpful, if necessary.",
            "OK, OK, not yet, but I will.",
            "OK, so, yeah. Now, that's actually good,. Oh, just, just checking. PERSON12, you are working from Brno now, right? I guess. Definitely, like, good idea, to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So,, OK, I'm thinking about it, like, what, what's your, - OK, we can, we can discuss it after, after the, after the meeting. I will send you, I will, I will message you on Slack and,, we can, we can discuss, what I want to do, like. But I think that, that things in general we have re-covered today, I just forgot to include attendance. So,. OK. So, that's, that's it. And yeah, let's, let's hear from you next week. It, it got little bit longer, or it got a little bit stretched out today, but I hope it's, it's fine for all of you. So, again,, see ya next week.",
            "See you.",
            "Bye guys.",

            "So that's all today.",
            "So, well I guess the agenda is the book as usual. Well, except for the book PERSON3 has some nice visualisations which he put into the ORGANIZATION4 so I don't know if we want to talk about this as well.",
            "I read the book already like the part of, not all of them. Well, I'm not like sure if there's actually anything to talk about. But, yeah, I redone some of the - Some of the embedding color maps which according to the,, Glove,, articles should, you know, show the bands and yeah, so before I've had some images that didn't show basically any bands. And now I've redone the training with different parameters and skip-gram seems to show much clearer bands than seebow, if seebow even shows any -",
            "At all. But still if you look in the book like the Glove image on, yeah, on you, on page - What's this page?",
            "Yeah. So I'm not sure what to make of this.",
            "It's also different language, yeah? It's Czech?",
            "No. No, no, no, no. This is all - Yeah, OK, it is foreign language between the original and the new one but then yeah, these are on Czech, the original one is on English.",
            "Although the color scheme is a little different but that's not the property of the image. Is this the last version?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Actually it push it? I'm not sure.",
            "Cause in the last version I think this Word2vec image should be the, the one from -",
            "From skip-gram which will look a little better.",
            "Yeah. And the FastTex does skip-gram or seabow?",
            "FastText,... I'm not sure.",
            "Skip-gram.",
            "Skip-gram.",
            "Let me check approving, yeah, the correct version is on my computer in the other room - I will go there and try to find out if I com. I, I think I've comitt that but I'm not sure if I put it to -",
            "To github. I'll check.",
            "Or it might be on the computer so -",
            "What is that?",
            "What?",
            "Is that weird rytmic sound coming from you?",
            "Yeah. It's the bread machine.",
            "Oh. By the way, PERSON6, when did you come to LOCATION1 on some, someday?",
            "I don't know. 8 p.m. something. 9 p.m.?",
            "OK.",
            "So is it there?",
            "Yes.",
            "That this is much faster by the car.",
            "Yeah, I. We took a slow train. It was the fast train but it was quite slow.",
            "Yeah, we've got a tra, traffic jam on, on, on D1 so, so I was thinking, oh, maybe the guys in the train were faster but -",
            "Oh, we went for lunch first and then we waited -",
            "OK.",
            "For a bus and then we waited for a train and then the train was quite slow.",
            "Yeah. We spent half a, an hour and half in LOCATION2 - Having, having a lunch so it's.",
            "Yeah, OK, I can see the new images so... Aha. So, so basically you can confirm that the parts are there but actually not for Glove which was -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Original claim.",
            "But I think,, the bands are still there for one there's like one, one band that is so strong that -",
            "You can really see the band elsewhere -",
            "Because you don't the, the column epids adapted so in -",
            "There's like one line of numbers that are much higher or much lower -",
            "Than the numers elsewhere then -",
            "No.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The numbers as well will just get squashed to the same color.",
            "Yeah. Do we also want to show that for seabow it seems not to happen?",
            "I'm not sure. Maybe. But then like what's the - Actually I would like to like - I would like to evaluate the embeddings somehow. Maybe, I don't know the, what's it called? The thank for evaluating embeddings?",
            "That's one - Or is this for sequences. I'm not sure transfiction. No, it's ORGANIZATION6 everyone. And this is for sentences finds.",
            "I don't know.",
            "OK. Anyway, maybe just on the PERSON4's assos, whatever, analogy task.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because I sort of suspect that like if the embeddings don't show any structure it's because they are not trained well. Maybe seabow needs more than skip-gram. I don't know.",
            "OK. So I guess let's move to the book. So,.. So from I saw so the main thing that happend is that,, PERSON1 and PERSON7 and PERSON5 went over some parts of the text and added some, some comments and to does and so on. So,, thanks a lot for that. At least I went mostly through my chapture and,, yeah, I have a few things to discuss mostly, yeah, mostly I agree with the comments and I will just,, try to implement the suggestions, so, so that's easy. And... Yeah, I guess maybe I can,, share the document so that we can,... How do I do this? Because there're a few things I would like to discuss. Can you see it now?",
            "Yes, I see.",
            "So there were,, yeah. Yeah, so PERSON1, neither he has some,, visualisations for, -",
            "The, the parter speech tagging. So yeah, I think this would be nice to, to add there. So -",
            "I'll be happy if you put it there.",
            "So I can just add a new subsection with visualisations because I have some text, it's not long -",
            "It's like summarize there. But those are mostly in the papers you already cited so, so -",
            "It won't be like zutas like,, sum,, summary of that.",
            "Yeah, I think that's fine like you can add it there and then we can see if we need to merge it or, or something but, -",
            "Yeah. Like my chapture is really low on any visualisations so I would be very happy for a, a, anything in this sense I guess. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so, so I will, I will add it this weekend.",
            "OK, thanks. Yeah,... Yeah,... This was an interesting note from,, PERSON7. So,, I talked about,, that models encoding some linguistic abstractions and PERSON7 suggested that maybe it encodes just some featchures and I'm really not sure about the germanology here. Like, well, it deffinitely encodes some featchures but then,, what we kind of want to do is to map it maybe to linguistic abstractions and... Yeah, I don't know what we want to call these things.",
            "Yeah,, I, I, I think, I think you said it quite exactly that, that, that,, we spot some featchures and map it to some extractions and, and, and - This is only people who have extractions, on the -",
            "Not the models.",
            "Well, I don't know like if, if you do some, I don't know, analysis of,, attentions and you find that it's similar to syntactic trees so that's, I wouldn't say, this is featchures, this is already structure of, of something. So I would say the abstractions emerged already in the model.",
            "I, I would still see that, that, that they're emerges some structure and, and we can map the structure to know linguistic abstractions.",
            "OK, so, so what say, so what's in the networks it's structures, it's featchures -",
            "But the abstractions it's not in the network, it's -",
            "Yeah. At the what's put -",
            "Into it.",
            "Yeah,, OK. Yeah. I think,, yeah. I think we can, we can define it this way. Cause like I don't have any, I don't know, strong opinion or, or anything. I just thought that, yeah, we're probably not using it consistently. I, I'll make a note. OK,... Yeah, that's fine. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, what's something, here are, yeah, another terminology call a thing, so yeah. So my understanding was that an LSTM cell is like one neuron in, in the network.",
            "No.",
            "And I think if PERSON7's understanding is, is like whole layer kind of?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is the cell?",
            "Yeah, that's the terminology.",
            "OK, so yeah, so again that's something that I didn't understand well, so OK. So, so kind of a cell and a layer are the same thing?",
            "Well, at least, at least in a frameworks if you,, applying a layer means like applaying the,, the LSTM overlack and entire sequence and, and cell is, is just like one step over, over one vector.",
            "Well, I think the whole RNN thing really breaks the neuron, you know, analogy because like I never seen any ilustration of neurons. There is always a vector coming in and a vector coming out.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, so the analogy isn't really use in this context.",
            "Also like it doesn't really make sense, right? Because -",
            "Quite it's that the mentions are independant inside?",
            "No.",
            "No?",
            "Not really.",
            "Only you know they are, the gates are not for everything the time.",
            "And there's like linear projections from -",
            "The vector -",
            "To the gate. PERSON6 OK, so this was mean there's no LSTM neuron for sake?",
            "No. Because the gates for the particular neuron depends all, all the other neurons.",
            "Yeah. So you would have like a many recurrent relationships inside the cell -",
            "If you want it to model individual neurons inside the cell.",
            "And then the recurrent look relationship over the cell -",
            "So, yeah. It's not really,,... Yeah, it's not really done that way. My English is terrible today.",
            "OK, so yeah, I guess I'll, I'll check again the - So in this case I'll check again the original paper to see what they really do because if I'm going to the bone neurons in cell so maybe I didn't even understand properly what they did. But -",
            "I, I think it's, it's fine that, that they, like in the output layer they really find like neurons like, like single numbers that correlate with something.",
            "This is what, what is in, in one of the PERSON8's paper from this year ORGANIZATION5 at they, they, they had some character of model and, and fou, found particular neurons that correlate well with some word boundaries.",
            "OK. OK.",
            "But this output would be also LSTM? It was some projections on top of that, yeah, or?",
            "Might be. I don't know.",
            "OK.",
            "OK. Yeah,, yeah, this is mostly note for myself that I have to check it more. Yeah. This is something general to discuss. So a general comment that's repeated from PERSON7 is that I talk about all of the linguistic abstractions but I don't kind of introduce,, the partical abstraction. So I just talk coreference but I don't say what's coreference or I talk about, I don't know all, all these things without, without kind of introducing them or show and yeah, we don't really have an introductory chapture on linguistics -",
            "That would explain what's morfolgy, what's syntax, what's anything, so,, there is like nothing to refer to,, and yeah, I didn't include any explanation. But,, my understanding was that we kind of write,, the book for people who kind of are more linguisticly orientated so they kind of know what's coreference or what's syntax.",
            "So I still agree that I, it would be good to at least say like in one sentence what's coreference or something. But,, I wouldn't include some kind of detailed introductions to these concepts.",
            "No, no, no. I, I didn't even ment of like this wh, which is, one, one sentence is fine but would, I ment by most of the missing introduction comments was,, why do we have a reason to believe that, that the neural networks should learn something like this.",
            "Like,, like you mean that coreference is a same and just we believe that if you want to understand language you need to understand coreference so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If didn't you understand language it should understand coreference.",
            "And, and, and since neural machine translation we can see that, that models do the coreference well and, and we need to think like as, as it a coincidence or, or did the neural network found out a work around or...",
            "How, how did it happend.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Got it. OK, so yeah. That make sense or this would - I don't know,, this kind of seems more like something I would put in the, in the introduction to the chapture like, -",
            "Just this is kind of true for all of the abstractions that these are kind of characteristical for language and we -",
            "Yeah, yeah, but - But for instance for the grammatical correctness,, I think that as, it will be better to discuss it like, like directly in the section.",
            "Yeah, I, I put it some short text and I think that people were considering -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Language model as a substitute for grammars, gramatical sentences get higher probability and -",
            "Again it's like coincidence or is it like encoded somewhere?",
            "OK. OK, yeah, I, I will try to do something with that. OK. Now at least I understand the point so - Yeah. But - So, so OK. And anyway I, I think OK, it makes sense to,, shortly,, say like in one sentence what's, what's dependency syntax maybe but, but not with detail. Cause it will be different for everyone like you commented and like the SSG stuff cause yeah, we don't know really SSG but other people know SSG and want know dependency syntax so that's, -",
            "But,, yeah, I guess we somehow have to expect the reader do, do know something about linguistic cause -",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, there is the section on negation which is a bit weird, yeah, -",
            "Yeah, I, I had a lot discussion,, what would, would people here in, in unique,, I think that the papers that you discussed are, are all from here.",
            "Aha.",
            "And,, the, they say the bird does not knew about negation and I say that, that bird knows everything about negation. Cause it's trained on realword sentences and,, he only negate sentence that, that sounds probable, otherwise would you that you have no need to, to say a negative sentence so bird tense to filling the thing that is most probable because it, it makes the most sense to negate.",
            "But...",
            "It kind of redealing with real language not like a formal language where -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So you mostly say things that are true and, yeah, you mostly talk about the real word and not about a non-existant word and -",
            "Yeah. And if you say, if you need to negate something you need to negate something that your conversational partner believes is true.",
            "Otherwise you would not negate it.",
            "OK.",
            "So negates thing that, that it believes are true.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And anyway, I'm not sure about including,, this,, this sort of,, stuff because it's and it's, this, this behavioral analysis -",
            "Yep.",
            "As we already say,, in chapture 3 or what it is, that, that we focus on, on the structural -",
            "PERSON7 Analysis. So if you like don't want to deal with that -",
            "And I, I, I think we can just omit it and, and -",
            "It would no harm.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree it's, yeah, like it would be good to include in the book but,, then,, PERSON1 manished.",
            "Maybe building finally dissapeared. Or the electricity stop working. Or the internet stop working.",
            "OK.",
            "Original started -",
            "Falling from the ceiling or whatever.",
            "Sorry, I just lost connection.",
            "OK.",
            "I'm back.",
            "Yeah,, so yeah, we just decided to remove the negation part -",
            "And yeah, otherwise I think I don't have any thing I need to discuss about my chapture so the rest of the comments it's like, yeah, I agree and I will try to implement it so - Unless you want to discuss something of that so we can move to, I don't know -",
            "Somebody chapture of -",
            "I would, I would like to know if I should read the, the second half of the chapture or if it's too late or, because,, I will, I will be working only this week and I, I'll have vacation the next week so everything I, I do would be, would be this week. So does it make sense if I read the rest of the chapture and, and add some comments this week or, or not?",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I think the rest of the chapture is ready to be read. Like PERSON1 read it already and added some comments so maybe PERSON1 can say if he thinks that it makes sense to read it at this point but I think I hope yes.",
            "I think I haven't any comments to the - Las, last sections so - It was about multilinguality or?",
            "The layers what's, what's on layer and, and a multilinguality, yes.",
            "Yeah. So I just thought that there is like two, I think there is couple of, I don't remember, but few sections that really,, repeats itself. Like they en, enrolled I think that one could be merge with another one. Because there, there was, - I don't think, yeah, I think lot of sections there was,,, discussed about different pretraining task and it was in, in many parts.",
            "So it this could be a bit merge like to, to say it in one, one thing.",
            "Because there is some,, arguments I think that's repeat themselves in different sections like -",
            "OK. Yeah,, it's I will look at it.",
            "Kove and PROJECT1 comparhasion.",
            "That those I think few papers that compare them and those are in different sections so, so it that take -",
            "Merged and I think -",
            "It only my comment to that.",
            "Yeah, OK.",
            "I also, when I read, there is one thing I think from - I don't know because when I read it I, I tried sometimes I was a bit sleepy but it was also some, sometimes bitten purpose to be like more less really - You know,, too, too think about some things that could not be understand, understood -",
            "At the first reading. So there is one words that, that I don't whether, maybe it's commonly known but it's QES, QES. I, I think it's from -",
            "One of the papers.",
            "So maybe they, they could be some, some more definition of that because for me it's didn't really say anything. I need to just look it up.",
            "Either I try it but -",
            "Yeah, -",
            "Because I think -",
            "Yeah, I'll check, check where I use it and, and see, yeah, if I can make it more explicite.",
            "Oh, this from couple times.",
            "They did something I just don't know and -",
            "Yeah, OK. Yeah, I think it's, it's,... Yeah, it's kind of,, a bit wage what it really means so, so I can, yeah, I can check what it means, yeah. Like to, so that is, is more clear but, but,, what was ment. OK. Yeah, so PERSON7 basically stopped somewhere before word senses it seems with his comments.",
            "So -",
            "I, I think - I think it's be like an efficial to, to also, to read it once more because, yeah, I say.",
            "For multilinguality maybe like,, they could be more, more to, to, to comment. But multilinguality was done by, by, by whom? Part? It was -",
            "Yeah. So this is, this is kind of,,, taken from,, a paper which -",
            "PERSON7 mostly wrote and I kind of adapted it for the book but,, yeah, it comes from that so -",
            "Yeah, this is -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I'm - Yeah. Yeah, I think about PERSON7 should look at it a bit and say -",
            "OK.",
            "If he thinks if this is fine but, but, yeah. It's kind of his text originally adapted by me so -",
            "I - It's probably too detailed as well, I don't know.",
            "Just lot of citations there but yeah, I think, it's - So it's qui, quite down say, I would say.",
            "Is that because you needed to have dense in an ORGANIZATION5 paper?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Something with it.",
            "OK,... So I guess we're probably done with my chapture so,, what do we want to talk about next? So it doesn't make much sense to talk about PERSON5's chapture I guess.",
            "Yeah, -",
            "This is the maximum.",
            "Loud -",
            "We can move elsewhere this, this what we can do.",
            "Anyway, sorry. What were you saing PERSON7?",
            "What are PERSON5's plans if I,, the question is if I read this, the, the, the chapture this week and, and, and leave some comments. Will he have time to, to do something about it next week or is it to late?",
            "If me or PERSON3?",
            "PERSON5.",
            "Or PERSON5. PERSON5.",
            "Probably.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, I think next week he's here, yeah.",
            "Probably.",
            "And anyway the deadline for the book is not really clear. So, yeah. I heard him discussed it with someone. Like about the, the rules of the grant like when the things really need to be finished and - It wasn't really clear even so like - Anyway like the sooner the better.",
            "But there might be some options of postponing some things so it's, yeah, I think it always make sense to have the comments there so there will be a chance to improve it and - Yeah, if just PERSON5 realizes that yeah, we have to sumbitted now, so just some things will be end of rest but,...",
            "I guess that's fine.",
            "Alright.",
            "Yeah, so I haven't read all the comments for my chaptures yet but from what I saw I will implement it and -",
            "And what else did I want to say? Yeah. We have this idea with PERSON5 last week when PERSON6 wasn't here reall. Because as your remember clearly,, when, three years ago when we were discussing the grant proposal, PERSON6 was saying, yeah, let's have a book, I like writing, I will write the whole thing and -",
            "So - So we think PERSON6 should,, we, we thought that maybe we could just sit down sometimes, probably next week or maybe the two of us can sit down this week and, and because PERSON6 has talent for, you know, making a lot of text appear - We could just, you know, talk to you about what we want to write and you can write it -",
            "Right there or we can just like discuss -",
            "The things that we are writing -",
            "And write it at the same time and -",
            "Maybe it will help us move forward -",
            "Yeah, that's fine with me.",
            "Sort of like the hackaton helps.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like I do have a problem with writing but I have to know the things that I'm writing about and the problem with this book is that, -",
            "Yeah, I'm mostly writing about things which I don't know much about so - That's, that's the hard part. Like -",
            "Yeah, maybe we can like -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Up and -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Discuss things and -",
            "Like -",
            "Write them -",
            "Yeah. Like I'm good at reading and I'm good at writing but I'm not good at reading. Yeah.",
            "Maybe I could like read some things for you and -",
            "Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's fine with me.",
            "Yeah. Tell me what to write so I can write about it. Then you say which parts are wrong and fix it and - Like, yeah. That's the way it works like with, with the, the book anyway. Like I write some things and then mostly PERSON7's, PERSON7 comments on it like in place is where is wrong and - Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I've already read in one paper like that -",
            "Then - So yeah, it's -",
            "Yeah, so maybe we should -",
            "It's possible to do that.",
            "We should try writing the book this way.",
            "Yeah. So yeah, whenever you -",
            "There is something that should be written,, like and yeah. I'm fine with that.",
            "Yeah, I'm for it, we can meet.",
            "Yeah, so I think next week -",
            "I can mostly be at work, - This week I'm not sure,... Yeah, but, yeah, next week should be mostly fine I guess. Yeah, and PERSON5 will be here sure, yeah, it should work.",
            "Yeah, sure it's not true that,, we are suff, supposed to send a book to the reviewers next week?",
            "Well, probably we're supposed to - But -",
            "But we'll probably won't.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "That's kind of my understanding as well, yeah.",
            "Yeah, when I last talk to PERSON5 last week, I've sort of, yeah, got the idea that like right now we're not really written with the precise deadline although we should hurry up as much as possible of course.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I saw some comments in,, in my chaptures.",
            "Right.",
            "I think that mostly concerned like, so I probably fix writing and that's it on -",
            "Yeah, I've seen it mostly PERSON5 comments. But I think it's mostly, yeah, like some -",
            "Improvements in the text, yeah. Yeah. I didn't,, go throught it recently so,, yeah. I, I look at the comments from PERSON5 and yeah, I don't think I have any, anything to add or -",
            "Alright.",
            "Yeah, I can also see that,, PERSON5 also had some comments even for the real begannings of the book like the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like if he want to dedicated -",
            "I don't know. Do you have some opinions on the dedication? Right now it's to,, PERSON2 who is just inventor of PROJECT3.",
            "I would probably remove that cause - Chemical substance help those us writing a book, it is not true. And -",
            "Yes.",
            "I have no, no other idea who we should.",
            "I think it's not obligatory to have a dedication.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, I think we can just remove it.",
            "We should come up with something.",
            "Yeah, we still have theacknowledgement of the motto. Yeah, I know PERSON3 -",
            "Doesn't like the motto but -",
            "We're not talking about the performance anywhere in the book basically.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like it is quite possible that he said something like that but...",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know.",
            "It's kind of specially people that we're writing the book for.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK. So,, do we want to have a motto, do, do you have some -",
            "Sure, we want but -",
            "OK.",
            "Better one.",
            "We want some but better one, yeah.",
            "OK, so we probably want to remove the dedication motto we have right now and the competition is to advance something better. OK. Yeah, then it use like PERSON5 also suggest to have an introductory chapture like probably introduction to the book or something and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know. I quite like the preface as it is but -",
            "Yeah, but, but introducion usually contains all these practical informations.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I haven't read it. Like these are the parts I always skip and I find them kind of useless,... So I wouldn't add them there. I don't know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I kind of even hate it in the papers like in the paper were in the introduction usually say that OK, well it should use it and then described what we do and then present results and then conclude the paper and it's like, yeah, what you expect anyway.",
            "Yeah. It, I think it's kind of from the journal papers if you have like 30 pages long paper it's, it's totally make sense if you have a short ORGANIZATION5 paper at 4 pages it's like -",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So OK, so this is kind of long so - So yeah, we could have something like that. Yeah, so like it, it's something I can write but,, yeah, if somebody put some bullets what to put there then I can turn it into text or -",
            "I think the bullets are already there.",
            "OK and - Yeah. Do you think it should be like just the preface or that we should have a new chapture just for that?",
            "I don't know. I would, I would visually separate this, this like this, this motivation in the preface, perhaps start on the next page. I don't know.",
            "OK. So I'll take a note and I can, I can put something there but - When, when I put it there then you will disagree with it and, and we will find on something to, to have there.",
            "Yep. Plan.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "OK, so I'm copying some ideas for a motto - To the agenda document.",
            "Being that can be understood is language. I don't understand it. So.",
            "Maybe, maybe we should - Maybe it will be easier if you put it on ORGANIZATION4 so we can discussed it later or -",
            "So -",
            "Or is, is it just one?",
            "Is one right now, I will - I will find more but -",
            "I don't.",
            "OK.",
            "By the way I have a next call in 10 minutes so -",
            "Discuss we should make that in, in 10 minutes.",
            "Well, no, I don't have anything more.",
            "Me neither.",
            "Me neither.",
            "OK. What about, what about chapture 4? Is it, is it ready for proofreading?",
            "Oh... Well, some parts are, some parts aren't.",
            "OK. And do we h, do we know anything about the revieweres or?",
            "No.",
            "OK.",
            "OK, I guess that's it.",
            "Yeah, see you. Do we have meeting next week, yeah? Like usual time?",
            "I think so. The usual time is usually different time than time but -",
            "11 I say but -",
            "But yeah. It's planned for the 28th 11 a.m.",
            "Yeah, which hasn't happened for sometime like the -",
            "Yeah, I, I would be there.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's fine with me so far unless something turns up.",
            "By the way, PERSON6,, the, the paper about mul, multilingual PROJECT2 already has 8 citations on, on ORGANIZATION2 Scholar.",
            "Cool. So it's still on PROJECT4 now or?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah. So, cool. OK, that's nice. You mean there are two versions of the paper on Archive, right.",
            "Like there is the ACL paper and then the PROJECT4 paper?",
            "Yeah, and one, one has 4 citations and the new, newer one has a 3.",
            "Cool. That's nice.",
            "And, and that was before the items on my, my ORGANIZATION2 Scholar profile and, and then two other citations of. I don't know which, which there.",
            "OK, interesting. So yeah, it sure seems that we don't need to paper to be accepted anywhere because -",
            "Oh, it's, it's actual the, my, my first paper that, that got some citations before being published so I, I that.",
            "Yeah. It's to me kind of seens the review process is weird like they didn't accepted but still people are interested in it and cited so -",
            "Yeah, but all the revieweres said a good point that, that our plan to import an information missing and -",
            "And it should be written as a long paper than a short paper and -",
            "So maybe this means that it should be accepted for PROJECT4 so we'll see.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Alright. So have a good day and see you sometime.",
            "Too. See you. Next week at the lane.",

            "Hi.",
            "Hello. Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah. Your view is, your view is bit distorted but I can still hear you.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yes I can hear PERSON5 but.",
            "Hello.",
            "Hi, everyone?",
            "Hi.",
            "I I think there is noise coming from a PERSON15's microphone. Yeah.",
            "Yeah? Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah. It, it, it's good now. So, let me know when to start. And if someone wants to break the ice. Maybe you PERSON15. If you want to start?",
            "I I shall, shall we wait for PERSON21 or should we start?",
            "He, he said in the evening that start thing even without him. Because he says, he is running bit late.",
            "Okay. Okay, so from my side I've been basically,, quite busy with my thesis as there is a deadline in like. Six days so am I've been mostly working on on that. And apart form that I've consulted with PERSON21 that we might do the domain adaptation for the demo of the PROJECT3 project like Per, PerTalk domain adaptation. But I just read some e-mail that there are some issues with like confidentiality of the transcripts and et cetera. So I am not sure if the speakers will allow us to get access to their talks before the actual event. So.",
            "Maybe.",
            "If, if we have the recordings or even the transcripts beforehand, then we we can make the like a PerTalk adaptation, because the idea was to show like the model without the talk adaptation and then run the model with the talk adaptation and show that the model is able to-Yeah. And be fine tuned to a particular speaker or talk. So, so it's. I think in a stage of discussion whether we can be allowed to use these transcripts or not. So, if if we are then I can definitely do the adaptation and yeah.",
            "So, I think before the adaptation you're using the sentences the words which was sent by PERSON1. So, are are you using that or are you adding some complementary data of your own?",
            "I'm I'm sorry. I I, there is things still some noise coming from somewhere. Because I I've overheard the the dataset you've mentioned.",
            "So, I am talking about.",
            "It w-It was PERSON12. That name, just PERSON12.",
            "Yeah PERSON1. So.",
            "Yeah. PERSON12, Okay I see.",
            "Ahoj. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I'm using the data from PERSON12 and then I am using like some, some additional texts like based on the algorithms that I've I've came up with for my thesis. So they basically. Like it extends, it extend the amount of domain texts if I get like domain boards, then I can find concrete context of theirs and also use technique with sentence embeddings to even more increase,, the amount of textual data. So, so I'm I'm using like this approach.",
            "Okay. So. So, sh shall I speak now or?",
            "Yeah. Feel free to. My headphone is really sensitive so I can actually.",
            "I shouldn't use oh the... Okay.",
            "So, we have realised that it is impossible to sit in the same room and be on the same call with head, with headphones because its it always,, takes picks-up the the sound from the other one. So one would have to very carefully mute who is not speaking. Sorry for coming late. And thanks for having started. So, yes feel free to continue. So, go one by one and I'll add my notes at the end in the meantime.",
            "Yes. So, this week I was mainly,, doing preparation for the demo meeting which was supposed to happen on Friday, but didn't. And apart from that, from last week I kind of lost some of the directories that were like quite important and had I spent a lot of time.",
            "This is, this is worth, this is worth saying to to many people because, what happened was that PERSON19 received the script and that script was trying to do some clean-up of some temporary directories he had created. But the remove minus RF was too aggressive and the temporary directory didn't get created. So instead, everything got deleted. So, whenever you receive any script from anyone, be very careful. It was obviously not intentional. It was like a bug.",
            "Yeah. It was a bug. Yeah. And another another thing,, which is,, very important, have back-up copies of everything that is de deployed in any way. So for this. There is already for months created and only PERSON3 has has actually populated it., there is net data PROJECT3, slash systems directory. And this is where everything should go. So for example, PERSON15 system should be there copied. This is this is the last resort for recoveries. And in,, another thing that we have learned fr in the demo was that even if we have such recoveries, such backup copies. They may not be complete, if they are not fully tested. So definitely copy there what you have, but also try to replicate it, replicate it from that copy. Because what happened ORGANIZATION2 was, that their servers room was down. They couldn't even connect to the machines at all. They were simply off. And they had a spare back-up copy of their segmenter system,, which was a,, like a full image,, that should have been fully functional, but it was not. So they have spent half a day on getting to re trying to revive this this system, but it was not complete. So it was a better position that than what happened to PERSON19, what this the removal. But still the back-up was incomplete. So do back-up. Systems are big. Modules are big. So makes the regular copies but that's it. And version everything. That's the that's the thing. Yeah. OK. So. Sorry for interrupting you. But this is very important for everyone.",
            "Yes. I think that it was quite important but I had to spend like a a complete day yesterday to get everything back. But I did get it back. So that was the good part at the end of the day. And I also spent,, ss most of the time last week to to figure out some bugs, which PERSON5 ultimately fixed and thanks to him. And, yeah, I think that's all for this week. An and by end. I'm done certainly I am almost done with training the new language model and adapting the current English ASR with,, demo adapted words. And. Yeah. I I hope to get it done soon. Yeah. So that's all from me and anyone which is good can take over.",
            "Yeah. Maybe, let's, lets mention what PERSON3 wrote. Share to this. Transcript for German. Yeah. So. This was the on-demand, the very quick request to get,, some scores for the the systems that we are deval,, evaluating for the demo. And,, the,, the question that I have is: whether PERSON3 already had a chance to evaluate the outputs. So, I know that PERSON15 sent the files and PERSON14 sent the files,, and we may have even other versions available,. Not yet. But other systems available. But the question is, do we have the scores. So PERSON3, please check. I know that you have commented the output somewhere. But we need to know which of these systems are,, the better ones.",
            "Hi All.",
            "Yes. So, please paste the path name here into the Google document. And maybe, since its just two systems,, but they are throwed across many files so some summary results should also go here into this document. So we can very quickly see which of these systems,, for each language, target language, is more promising. But,, we should look at the details. Because, the domains obviously make a big difference.",
            "But shh. I should, evaluate files by files, yes?",
            "Yes. Please evaluate both. The whole concatenated thing and also file by file by file or rather domain by domain. So, in the original layout like directory by directory. So the PERSON17 domain and the Antrecorp domain,.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. I understand.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. So the next is PERSON5, right?",
            "Yes, hello. So I actually do reviews for the audible SLT system submission. So, I so you to need to finish a paper and until the 25th of May. Yesterday I fixed the Czech segmenter delay and I reduced it from ten seconds to approximately a hundred milliseconds. I mean, it is still imperfect, because it doesn't use the following context, only the previous and sometimes it misses some full stops. So it needs to be fixed. But this fix is quite complex. And it also debates the he we have that one input segment in it's one output. So we need to re redo it so that there sometimes, there are two output segments. I think and it just needs some new complementations. And I am fixing back-end ASR for the submission of the core project I have feedback from my tutor. And after this should be done. It may be adapted to have to provide this scenario. Just right now I updated it. So it should be working for ASR but I restarted the worker that we have in and it didn't work. It hasn't started. So I can't check it.",
            "Yes. So you. And you've already e-mailed PERSON17 right?",
            "Not yet.",
            "Yeah. Then on Friday we did writing of subtitling and I collected the data and I haven't done anything with with them.",
            "Yes. So this is actually very interesting thing. This is like the very first attempt to evaluate, to life evaluate spoken language translation. So people are watching subtitles and at the same time they are clicking on one of four buttons. And we need key strokes to speed it up,, and we also need to repeat this and like find the best practice how to actually do it because it is. I find it difficult to,, the to follow both so its, the idea of manual evaluation of spoken language translation is extremely difficult. So we need to come up with,, the solid practice. This is a good starting point. And we will lear learn something from that. It definitely makes big differences. We see big differences between for example the source language or the source domain that that plays a big role in the final scores. And and the languages, obviously. But, to do a fine brained error analysis its is difficult. Its not just tedious but its also complicated, how to actually do it. So I don't know if one would. This this is the the practice of interpreter evaluation. So this is what the teaches teachers of interpretation do. They listen to both, the input sound and the sound of the interpreter. And they make like tick, ticks on the on the table. So this is what we should try to learn ours ourselves an and do it simpler, obviously, because we don't have their experience with that. But if you were interested in this, then get in touch. And also, if you expect that we will ask you for some help again with this once we have like another session to to run this evaluation in a better way. Yeah. Okay? Thank you. Yeah. So that was PERSON5 and then we have PERSON15. Yeah. So PERSON15, free to. Are you here?",
            "Yeah. I am here. Sorry I have been mu muted because of my microphone quality. Yes. So, I I don't have anything to report. But I will have time again from from the next week. So I I can again start working on your tasks, And And actually I would like to try some modifications of of the Rainbow model, which I find interesting. So so maybe like I could try what what you ment mentioned in the in the email in the morning with the shortening model. And also, I found a few papers about,, about making machine translation robust. Which are,, of think, quite new. So its. So maybe I would,, fro try,, some of this to to improve performance on the on the ugly ASR outputs.",
            "Yeah. With the shortening, I actually wanted to. Yes, that's good that you are bringing this up. So,, we have already been asked that by the users. To make the subtitles easier to follow by shortening them. By removing drop words, like rl, not really drop words. But but by removing useless words and and so on. And at this moment,, we have an annotator, PERSON8 Level,, doing a to manual transcription of one of the demo videos, which is German speech. And it is already equipped with like professionally corrected subtitles in German. And what he is is speaking is a bit more verbose. So we also have the German data that illustrate this. But it will be only like 20 minute s long speech. And there is an older paper, I think its PERSON13 one, on sentence compression. And. So this is this is one of the works on on that. So this is something that we should look at as well. And I have,, reviewed,, Phd. thesis, that also,, they. It was PERSON18 La, so Lake, Lakel, rlrl.. Lake and then W. And,, and this is PERSON18's thesis also has these experiments on the controlling the length of the output. And it works pretty well for him. So I think it should work for us was the for us as well. Even in the multilingual modules, ideally. So, we should have a Rainbow model that abbreviates while it translates.",
            "O, also I I was thinking that a actually the there is a second thing that we could also try and not to just shorten the the translation, but also try to force the model to use the same,, synonyms every time. Because Yeah, uh. when, when translating like. Like ten times the same sentence. which gets longer and longer, then perhaps we will use different synonyms and the that will cause like translation speak to jump.",
            "So the increased stability. You mean to increase stability by by that.",
            "Yes, Yeah.",
            "Yeah. That would be also useful. And there are other papers that focus on stability. So, and I would like take it step wise. So for now, I would focus only on the shortening. And the stability would be the next thing. And I also know that the ORGANIZATION5 people have been working on the stability somehow. So maybe they have a paper on that. I I don't know exactly.",
            "So let's focus on the shortening. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, and then, okay, oh, well, so, but we have other. Someone else. PERSON6 is here, right? So, PERSON6 was not saying anything yet. So PERSON6, please add yourself or someone please add add PERSON6.",
            "Hi. Hi there. I've already spoke Oh, Okay. at the beginning before you came. But I I could do it. No.Okay. It Its not in the document so I was confused.",
            "I will write it down to the document.",
            "Yeah. And I've received en email from PERSON2. He is not here unfortunately. which is,,, quite bad. So, what I wanted to say, aside from. So,, yes. There is still the demo,,, on Wednesday. So hopefully tomorrow, we should learn if a ORGANIZATION2 power supply is stable or not. And, if it is,, then will schedule a new date. It can be as early as,, on Friday. But I don't. I'm not sure if it if it will happen on Friday or or not. And I would like to make use of this time, to, select,, the pipelines based on some evaluation. So, for PERSON3, from PERSON3 we need the MT scores. And we should also try if we have any variance of of speech recognition systems. We probably don't have that. Yeah. So, I'm thinking how to best proceed. So maybe the best idea would be to. So and this is mainly for PERSON19 to again to prepare a full dry run session for the demo. With the the videos as we will use in the demo. And and we could invite a few of you, to help us with with the clicking. So that we see, for example, if one of the videos is is worse,, then we would go for the other one. And another related thing is the domain adaptation. So, PERSON19 do we have any response from PERSON24? You are muted.",
            "I haven't. I haven't emailed him yet about the German ASRs.",
            "Ple please do. Oh. Okay.Okay. And whenever you are in Slack, then look at whether he is active there or not. But he is not responding to my emails the so far. So, yeah, so I don't know what what is happening there. And so the German,, adaptation is problematic. The English adaptation is is ready, right? You have remarked everything. So you can do even language model adaptation, right?",
            "Yeah. I I I can do that on the English Model. Yeah.",
            "So, please prepare the baseline workers and also the domain adapted including the language model. So, let's call them like cheating workers, because they know what is going to be said. It is not sheathing, cheating in that real sense, because it is very often the case that a speeches are pre-written. And then the the speaker only pronounce like reads them loud, kind of. So it is good,, to to show both. To have the the option to compare. And, so, prepare, prepare these workers for English. For each of the speeches and PERSON6, how is it with Czech. You are ready to deploy the multiple worker? The baseline workers and and the domain adapted ones? The language module aware ones? Or is that a problem? I think I we've discussed this recently, but I do not know how how much time have for that.",
            "Yeah. Its, it's not a problem. I can do it. But I've, I just check then email, that you've sent today and from what I understood, there is, there are some issues with it like the confidentiality over the, whether we can use the.",
            "That's that's a totally different thing. Think that is a totally different thing. So the email for from today that's the like the request from someone so that we do transcribing for them. So that is not related to the demo.",
            "Okay. Okay, I see. So we and are are the transcripts for the demo available somewhere, then?",
            "Yes, they are. So that's because we have to. So, one is, so,, so PERSON19 have you sent me the short, the three minute transcript? Or not yet?",
            "Not yet, but they are, they are in my logs.",
            "Yeah, please send me the path to that one. And I'll I'll correct that and. So that will be the short one. And for the long ones,, PERSON11 already responded which of the consecutive videos will use. Because, he said one them is,, we are going to re-use the videos which are part of the PROJECT3 test set. And this is the videos where the English side was spoken by a non-native speaker. And the Czech side is then after every paragraph,, spoken,, by a Czech speaker. Like a consecutive translation. So they are reading the the translation, pre pre-prepared translation. And we already have transcripts for this. And one of the files is, that I've already like chosen correctly and the other speech is something which needs to be replaced with one where we do have the transcript. So essentially, it is the IST files in the PROJECT3 test set. For the conse ORGANIZATION3 consecutive. So PERSON6, are you following?",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "So,, so it will be in Czech. It will be three videos. One is the short one - three minute., maybe maybe keep taking notes.",
            "Okay.",
            "One, one is the three minute and I will correct that today. And and two more are like,, 20 minutes each, I guess. And, the transcripts are ready, because this is what the consecutive interpreters were saying. And PERSON21 is now cutting the videos so that we have like a separate English track and separate Czech track. Previously it was interleaved. So the original YouTube video is interleaved. And PERSON11 will split these two videos into four files. So that it is like always full only English. And then only Czech. And only English and only Czech for the second video.",
            "Okay. Great.",
            "So this is this is the videos that will be showing. And we will be probably showing the same videos for both, Czech source and English source. And the German s is like us aside that that's two other videos. And we do not have the option yet until PERSON24 says anything. We not we do not have the option, to, to inject the language model.",
            "And, do you also need automatic transcript for these four video, four files? This English, English and Czech, and Czech?",
            "Not at the moment. It would, yes. So, please, do it. Because, this is the, non-adapted workers.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And. And. I thought it would be good to compare it later, when we have the adapted workers. Exactly. Exactly.",
            "Please have these transcripts ready. And then we'll measure the scores as well for when when PERSON6 injects, the the Czech language model later.",
            "And the deadline for this is for this Friday or next Friday?",
            "Definitely this Friday. And earlier would be better, because there is little chance that the demo could take place this Friday already.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "OK. So it should be.",
            "So, please could you one more time repeat the path to to the test set? Is it in PROJECT3 test set.",
            "Let me check the. GitHub PROJECT3 its IWSLT non-native test set actually and I'm not sure whether you have access to that. So that is a, that's a potential problem. Test set ORGANIZATION3 consecutive,, and oh there is not. Mm-hmm, so we had not committed these. SLT ORGANIZATION6 SLT datasets. And now we are probably running into the problem that. Dev set parts. first review. IST it should ve versioned. Strange. That VG that, Okay, done, released as. So it should be Dutch and is missing. It should be done. So I'm pasting now to the Google document. Where is that.. I figure the bullet points, don't know why they always break for you. So yes. Keep them, on, there is there is a button for the bullets up yeah. So this is the ORGANIZATION3 consecutive,, this is where the test set should be. I'm copying it now from like a our sh our sheet. And it should be Austrian and Dutch, ant it should be TTCS read. So the files,, files called Austrian and Dutch, I guess. With the suffix TTCS read and the sound the sound is in dot IS.waw because that like, that's like interpreted. Strange. I'm not sure if this is.. Yeah hopefully it is like that. So.",
            "So. So at the end there should be like non adapted version of the model. And then second version, which is fine-tuned on these texts, right?",
            "So, actually. When I say non-adapted, lets lets make it clear. So, so the ideal system audio workers to be deployed for the demo. Non-adapted,, so fully generic CSENDE ASR and then adapted, adapted non-injected so this is a already including whatever PERSON12 found and created. Wordless as well as LM data, if any. And now, accept,, for the talk themselves and then LM injected and that includes the exact speech transcript. So this is the ideal. and this one, the adapted. So actually, no, no, no, no no. Yeah. an and then the order of importance is this one. This is the most important one. This is the second most and third one. Um.. Numbers indicate priorities. So, the most important one is the generic. Like is the adapted one for the domain. We don't have these yet, right? At this moment we only have three. PERSON19, please confirm.",
            "Yes. Yes. I yes. Because. I I.",
            "Are you following? Are you looking at the. Is is PERSON19 looking yeah.",
            "Yes, so its created from only generic Czech, English, German. So we have right now.",
            "This is what we have.",
            "Because I I. Are there? I get it. Yeah.",
            "Are there already some data from PERSON12? Because I haven't received any like to domain data,. Get in touch with him. I think he did.",
            "I think he sent them, you were in that email. But anyways I will send it to you again.",
            "That. That will be great.",
            "There is a directory that PERSON19 is now populating, right? So, where is? Yeah. Where are all the,, demo,, preparation files? So this is. PERSON19, I I I thi I in e in an email yesterday I sent you that it would be good. If you could put all the videos and all the data to one talk level adaptation sub drive, right? Do you remember?",
            "Yesterday?",
            "Or the day before yesterday.",
            "So PERSON19. the demo, vid video which we are, which we will be presenting there in the main. Yeah, I have I have them downloaded. But.",
            "Yes. Yes. Please organise them in this directory. And only simling them or from where you now use them. Please find PERSON21's email. Is it Okay. Can you also? Yeah. I I'll find it.. It was mentioning net data PROJECT3 ta data sources talk level adaptation and and asking you to create a sub direct. So this is, this is, this is where everything should go into. So this is, please PERSON19 fix this path when you find this. When you create the sub direct. And back to the workers types. What we have now is the non-adapted one Yeah. and we have the data from PERSON12 so we should use them to create the adapted models. And,, once this is done, then we should also run the LM injected ones. So that will be really with the exact speech transcript.",
            "Okay..",
            "So does that make sense, PERSON6?",
            "Yeah, Yeah. It does. If you please PERSON19 could send me, resend the email from PERSON12.",
            "Yeah. I will, I will send you that. Ok, so I will. I will make it a priority and try to like make it, I don't know, Thur till Thursday morning, is it OK?",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also PERSON6, do you have any English worker or not at all? English model in Kaldi, no.",
            "Not at this moment.",
            "Yeah, Okay so you are. Yeah. You don't have any. Yeah.",
            "Like, yeah. I I had. I tried the Mozilla common voice but I don't know. Do, do we want to use that one? Or?",
            "I think it would be worth trying. Because we are in better control over this then modules by ORGANIZATION2. But it, it is a lower priority.",
            "How is the ORGANIZATION4. Kaldi ORGANIZATION4 worker?",
            "Yep.",
            "Because in the system this was the other primary submissions, so I believe. Yeah. It should be deployed, possibly.",
            "Well the ORGANIZATION4 worker was provided by PERSON21, but it is not too difficult to replicate the. Because he used, or from what he told me, he used some Kaldi set-up which is. So its not. It shouldn't be.",
            "So it never was a worker. It was just a system run. Okay.",
            "Yes. This was just the sys. Exactly. But we, we could train our own ORGANIZATION4 system. I think it's, it could be quite interesting, Yeah. potentially.",
            "Yeah. So, let's not plan to do this for the demo. But let's put it into the back of our heads as a, like an improvement for the English,,, ASR system. And let's do it later. We can always say in the demo that based on our other evaluation we have a better system. A recipe to get a better system, but we haven't done that yet. We've just evaluated something and we know what, what we should do now.",
            "Yeah. That's sounds like a good, good thing.",
            "So. PERSON19, another thing that I asked you before was to have,, like a set of slots of these test sessions. Please put them, put them here. Directly in this document Okay. Okay. It's for the upcoming. It's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and then,, two or three days for the next week. Fix sometime whenever you are available to to come to the office and and have this running and people will sign-up, when they are able to follow. And,, for each of these days, please also,, indicate what should be deployed by by then. Or like wh what would, what is going to be tested. And obviously this will get improved, as as people provide new things. Yeah.",
            "And should we also include in these tests?",
            "Yeah. That's right. That that's right. Yeah. So, either put it here or put it in the demo document and link demo document from here.",
            "Or why don't I also put in the, put it the document and write an email and.",
            "Yeah. But, but it actually belongs better to the demo, the demo document. Because we also want other parties to be involved in this.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, you were talking about the demo document. Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So remember, in four minutes we are going to be cut off, a forcefully. So is there anything else to,, to say?",
            "Just a check. Yeah. Okay. Please. No, no, just a confirmation if the new models should go into the electro systems directory already? And the So. for the demo?",
            "So,, ss, yes, wel. What is, what is a model. So,, this this PROJECT3 system is for back-up of the important things and these models are fairly important, because they will serve in the demo. So, yes, they they should go there. The question is, if we are looking at these idle workers,, does it mean like three almost identical copies of the same thing? Yes, feel free to make it as free identical copies. Or feel free to make it cleverer, so that will be one directory which will have three, three start-up files in, in there. Whatever is more convenient for you.",
            "Okay. So I will probably check with PERSON19, right?",
            "Yeah. Yeah. And and definitely,, we need to be very careful about not confusing thing. So, we need to know which worker. The workers have sig should have signatures that indicate it, for which talk they are adapted. And PERSON19 needs to have the set-ups, the the launching scripts ready for each of these. And it would. It should very clearly say: \"You have now launched this and you have now launched this.\" And,, there is a very big risk of of mis messing things up. So,, the log there. Shuld. Does the log there mention the workers? The exact fingerprints of workers that were used?",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Ma make sure its there, because we need to see when we get the log theirs then, which worker was used. Whether it was the LM injected or the adapted or the non-adapted.",
            "So basically the logs also have the command behold pipeline. As a text, as a text file so and basically it contains everything.",
            "But the platform is free to like to downgrade to go into more generic models,, and that could change the behaviour of the pipeline. If I understood correctly, if your exact fingerprint is not available, it will easily drop the domain and launch,,, the generic model.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I I understand. So basically when I use domain adapted and lauch a new worker that very fingerprint, that very worker should have a unique signature.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So ho.",
            "That's what you mean.",
            "We need to know which worker was actually used. Whether the adapted one or the non-adapted one.",
            "Yes, that's what I am saying that I have. So basically the pipeline which basically learns it's saved a text file."

            "I don't mi. Yeah, okay, yeah,, never mind. So hi, PERSON7. So have you seen my,,, request or,, the e-mail to consider,, work package leadership?",
            "Yes, so we can't. So idea. Sorry. We are both. Some are not there in the office today,, this week, so it's a little bit -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Busy. So I'll be also -",
            "Yeah.",
            "A little bit late with writing. So I think one problem with data might be that currently, we don't have,, person-months in there.",
            "Well, the. So this is or. So I don't know what is your status of person-months, Like whether you have already reached what seems,, reasonable, Or whether you _",
            "I -",
            "Can still add more?",
            "I think we hadn't but if you can add more, that's of course great. The problem was that we also, I mean, we're very few in SLT and MT yet because we had to put so quite some on ASR.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Because nobody else is doing it. We would like to do more on the other 3 task, SLT, MT and. But of course, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "We are somehow limited. If you want. I mean, that's. Because we were already involved in 4 work packages like ASR, MT, SLT -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And,,, minuting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's why we didn't put.",
            "I don't think that should be a problem.",
            "Okay, yeah. I mean, but we have to yeah. But,, so but if you want, I guess, we could also lead that. Or we could wor lead the,, -",
            "Last 1,, the minuting.",
            "Hi everyone.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Hello? Hello. Okay. So,, well, we'll we'll discuss this, PERSON7, in a second, also with,,, with ORGANIZATION5. Because I also haven't heard from,, PERSON1 on this. So,, I think we are all,, because PERSON12 is not going to join today, and also,, ORGANIZATION14, ORGANIZATION14 is not going to join the call, although they,, have,, created this,, GoToMeeting for us. And by the way, the GoToMeeting is being recorded, so the - this is for the exercise of the minuting to have some, some recordings. So I hope you're all okay with this and thanks for,, coming and welcome. And,,, so, as you see,, the, the agenda in the ORGANIZATION1 doc has, has grown a bit. Have you, did you see my screen or not?",
            "Yes, we see your screen.",
            "Yes, okay, yeah, yeah, that's good. So,, so the first point is an update on ORGANIZATION14 status. That's like the official way of their involvement in the project, and we are discussing this, and we're in contact with the contact points and all that. So,, in the P part it seems that they should be, at least for now list be listed as as a partner. But in the actual application, they will be the 3rd party linked through us and the. So that's,, that's why the, the proposal,, in the,, in. So there's the requested ORGANIZATION2 contribution. And the requested key ORGANIZATION2 contribution is somewhat lower than the total, total estimated eligible costs. So this is the current, this is the current status. From the,, technical point of view, we should probably treat them as a standalone partner contributing rather few person-months. And the,, responsibility,, that this happens is on us, because they're linked through us. Okay. So then,, the other thing is something that,, I need to discuss,, probably only with,, ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION12. And that's the leadership of work packages. Because as ORGANIZATION14 are like not a standalone, not a full partner here,, they cannot lead the work package,, on data. So,, I thought that,,, it would be the good that one of the research partners,, does this. And,, we are responsible for the multilingual MT and management and for, now for minuting as well. So,, like we have data and minuting kind of available,, for ORGANIZATION12,, or ORGANIZATION5, or we can do it,,, s as well, but, Yeah, so,, yeah, this is. I don't know if ORGANIZATION5 has any opinion on this?",
            "So,, I think it would make more sense if,, ORGANIZATION13 keeps the minuting part because you also, -",
            "Okay.",
            "You've meaning the,, getting at the concept you have the most involvement there.",
            "Yeah -",
            "And I think,, it's okay, to have the data work package. Either us or ORGANIZATION12 ORGANIZATION12 what they what their position is.",
            "Yeah -",
            "Yeah, so I've talked to. Yeah, PERSON7, PERSON7, s please, say this say that.",
            "So yeah, I mean,, of course you wrote most of it, so we can also keep the minuting, otherwise since ORGANIZATION5,, ORGANIZATION5 has more on data, I would have suggested that ORGANIZATION5 does data and we do minuting, but I'm fine with anything else too.",
            "Okay, yeah, so that's that's very flexible. Thank you. So I would suggest indeed that ORGANIZATION5 takes the data,, and then,, we or ORGANIZATION12 we will do minuting. And we'll see like. It's it's not very important actually. So I'll check the involvement and planned involvement of ORGANIZATION12. And if it's, if the involvement is really imbalance, and if there is totally us in the end, when the numbers are polished, it's probably better if we keep that. But if it's like, We c we can have the majority of person-months, but still, if it's if it's kind of comparable, then,, it would be okay also to, to give it to ORGANIZATION12. Okay? So PERSON1 _ The main question. Will,, lead data. Is that okay?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, thank you. Okay. And then the next bit is,, the involvement of everybody in the integration work package. So PERSON12 is traveling and that's why he's not available,, in this call today. And,, the, the ORGANIZATION4 is, is not very,, z easily editable for,,, him. So we agreed that for the work package 6,, there is this separate ORGANIZATION1 document for now. And that's where he is describing the, the work package,, and I will part then port this to,, the ORGANIZATION4. So this is the authoritative document for,, integration. And,, it's important that everybody,, will check this document and provide,, input to, to PERSON12. And this should be finished tomorrow. So PERSON12 is like accessing this document every now and then, and he plans to have the complete draft ready tomorrow. So everybody please check this and contribute to this. The most important parts are these missing,,, bits. S, for task 6.2 as now proposed the integration with the unified communication platform. And this is something that A ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION11 have to discuss,, like,, s directly with each other so they know their technical,, preferences and constraints and all that. And,, s th. From like the management or the user point of view,, there's if someone is,, using the ORGANIZATION6,, ORGANIZATION6 teleconferencing,, thing,, there will be simply some like the Translate this for me or Interpret this for me, and the subtitles should pop up. And technically,, there will be some link between ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION11, And it has to be created at some point during the project. So that's the that's my understanding of what the unified communication platform is. And my understanding is that this unified communication platform is,, only for the online meetings. For the live meetings,, that's,, something that,, PERSON12 put now into,, the,, last task,,, which is,, the ORGANIZATION14 events and in and the publishing platform. So the idea is that,, there w. At the conference or at the workshop. There will be the microphones, and that the signal will be gathered and translated somewhere, and then it has to be delivered to the participants in as subtitles. And that's the publishing platform, this delivering the subtitles to the, to the users. And that can be anything on cell phones,, so s. Yeah, so, I've been trying to persuade PERSON12 to have the separate,, so that we would be have 1 task on the platform deli, development. And another task on the actual presence of the technical people at these events,, to, to debug the thing,, as it is running. If PERSON12 is fine, then we will have actually 5 tasks and not,, 4. And,, if he's strongly opposed, then this task will probably be merged. Or there is another option,, to like merge this publishing platform into this unified communication,, platform. And I don't know what is, what is better. So this is this is for,, ORGANIZATION6 and,, ORGANIZATION11 to discuss directly, and I'm happy to join that,, communication, but mainly all the decisions will be on you. So if ORGANIZATION6 can confirm that they are,, aware of this, and they will,, try to get in touch with PERSON12, and we could have a separate call,, tomorrow on this. I don't know what is your availability,,, ORGANIZATION6.",
            "So we -",
            "I think we can coordinate, yeah, we can coordinate that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe not tomorrow, know.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But we'll, yeah, we'll figure it out.",
            "Yeah. So another thing, which is very much related to this,, is the integration of the minuting. And that is something where we also need to be present. So that's task which is now planned,,, as task 6.3. And I estimated that this would be the 2nd and 3rd year of the project,, because first the minuting obviously has to be,, created. And there are some Milestones related to this, that,, the actual summarizations offer should be expected only in the middle of the 2nd year or something like that. So there is like a half year, s, s head or ORGANIZATION9 time at the beginning,, so that,, ORGANIZATION6 can,, create what they need. So that's, yeah, this is this is also something that we should,, discuss. And if you can I would prefer to have at least a short meeting tomorrow,, because well, time is really running up and we need to write the text that,, describes what we're going to do, so what we should agree on those things very early. So that but that's something that w yeah, ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION11,, and us have to, have to talk about primarily. And then,,, below, further below is what PERSON12 proposed under the title Deliverables. And he listed just the months and the titles. And I suggested to have fewer deliverables here. So this is important for like all the partners because that's the integration. And,, s I suggest to have,, the, the first engine integrated,, only as a Milestone, not as a Deliverable. Then the preparatory event should be also a Milestone as I see it. There, For the publishing platform,, I would actually make it a deliverable,, which is a software and the report. But I don't have this confirm from PERSON12 yet. And then the unified communication platform is the,, link between ORGANIZATION6, ORGANIZATION11 and then,, like s remotely also,, all us,, but we are like hidden, we are, we are behind the ORGANIZATION11 wall. And,, I think that this could be probably a Milestone only, but it could be also a Deliverable with the report, like a software delivered. So at s, that is this is something that,, ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION11 have to,,, agree on. And then,, the ORGANIZATION3 event. That's the ORGANIZATION10 that's the main conference. I'm,, re, considering,, to make it a deliverable actually. Maybe later,, with some ORGANIZATION9 time after the, after the actual conference. So a there will be a task, the task which is now 6.3 I b, 6.4 I believe. There would be for all the partners to attend,, the conference,, well, rather the servers-room during the conference time, And,, hack and fix whatever is needed to give a smooth performance of the systems. And then I would suggest that this deliverable with some months later should describe,, what has been done. And part of this as a digest could have a form of a journal paper, like that we have delivered this automatic interpreting and how all that worked. So does this make sense to, to do the research partners? And also to. Well, ORGANIZATION11 is not here. But,, to ORGANIZATION6 for the dissemination,, purpose for example? Does this make sense?",
            "Yeah, this makes sense. Okay, so I have to activate my microphone all the time but. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, okay. So I'll, we'll see whether PERSON12 likes this as well and hopefully,, he will. So that's, that would be a deliverable associated with the ORGANIZATION3 Congress. And then there is a what I would make a milestone. The automatic minuting integrated,, with the platform. So the I've said that's the first version. And the reason is that,, still, the tasks on the development of the minuting are running,, f bel,, even after this month,, 28. So that's why I expect that there will be like a final version,, f closer,, towards the end of the project. But I know that time is packed and, at that,, time of the project already. So, so this is something which I,, did the first version of is something that I put into,, brackets there, and I might actually remove it. And for,, the other events that we will have,, after the ORGANIZATION3,, Conference, I suggest that we have,, again,, reports of deliverable that will describe how these ran. And but that would not be like probably that much,, publicity needed towards that, Because these would be smaller meetings, and we still need to learn from the experience. And like,, collect the i, the user complaints, and collect technical,, s issues that we encountered, and propose fixes which what's for month 32, Which hardly,, be fixed th by the of the service at the end of the project. So, please, everybody and especially ORGANIZATION6, contribute to this. The involvements, the number of person-months. It's, Like everybody should have person-months,, in, for example, the integration. So the person-month,, should not go into this ORGANIZATION1 doc. Please put the person-months into the, the ORGANIZATION4,, or treat the ORGANIZATION4,, tentative in this, in this respect until this is merged in. And that should happen,, over the weekend, hopefully. So hopefully most of this document will be,, finished tomorrow, and I can merge it,, to the ORGANIZATION4 over the weekend. So that's a that's a the inform integration work package. And now let's move to the overall,, proposal. So the big thing is the project name. And,, I've asked also other colleagues, but not too many. So I'll I invite you to ask around as well, because we have now,, two,, names with,, like,, general p, s general preferences,, on them. And one of them is the PROJECT1 and the other one is the PROJECT2. PROJECT2. Yeah, I'm I'm undecided. So. Yeah, ask around if you have any strong opinions. I think both names are good. Yeah. Any opinions how to proceed?",
            "I think both acronyms fine, but if you actually spell it out, PROJECT2 kind of has a nicer than -",
            "Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. PROJECT2 has a nicer content,, spelled-out version. Yeah. So the problem of PROJECT2,, being too similar to liter is not. If we pronounce PROJECT2,, then it's okay, I think. So there is there is now slide shift like at least in my head towards PROJECT2, so I've we might end up as PROJECT2. Okay?",
            "So -",
            "I think even if it's not it's PROJECT2, it's it's s -",
            "PROJECT2, yeah.",
            "Close.",
            "PROJECT2 is close -",
            "Elite than it is to liter. My s my -",
            "Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, So we will probably,, have this. Yeah. Okay. So now,, the next point is that every work package leader,, should present,, the,, respective work package. PERSON15 is commenting something. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's the pronunciation. So,, I would like now to,, ask a every work package leader to present their work package, and now we'll run into the problem that we are not quite decided who is going to lead which work package. So,, the best way to look at work packages and our commitments is to look at these,, compact tables. And that's why we prefer to have,,, the,, proposal organized this way. So the 1st work package,, is on data. And,, it was supposed to be led by ORGANIZATION14, but this is now changing. It could be us or it could be,, s ORGANIZATION5. And,, I'm,, happy to present it,, s at the beginning. And the person-month that I've put here. I think I've put also like the person-month for, for other research partners in. And for ORGANIZATION14 myself. So the treat these numbers as very tentative and consider,, any updates. And do any updates in the ORGANIZATION4 as, as you like. So overall, this work package. Well, there's one more thing. The,, maybe to give you an overview. We have a picture. You might not have noticed, but we have a picture of the project structure, and that picture fairly reflects this. This is the picture. It says that data provides,, input to all the research work packages,, and,,, then their research work packages,, the ASR and MT, c, contribute to SLT, And ASR contributes to minuting and data,, also contributes to minuting, and the work package on integration somehow get theirs all the results from these work packages. I may did this,, inexplicit because,, the ASR will also be directly used in the integration. Some people would like maybe to see just the OTHER5 subtitles without any translation, And,, we are deliberately not very specific about the machine translation service,, That we are delivering,, like for text,, documents. That's that's something that is boring to do and, in the worst case, we can do it, but we kind of rely also on the SEF, the OTHER3,, translation,,, facility run by DGT, that we will rather provide technology to them and leave the, the translation on them. So this is a there is no deployment of the translation service planned in the, in the project. But there is research,, plan,, th research plans. And the work package dissemination then,, publicizes,, all these,, results,, from the work packages,, and the management,, like stands on the side and checks that everything proceeds smoothly. So now let's,, move to the work package on data. And then the next one will be,, ORGANIZATION12,, presenting the, this, the planned task in the work package,, on,, ASR. So within data,, I've created tasks for data for speaker and accent adaptation. So,, here,, the idea is that,, we will,, record, re-speakers and,,, process this data and create the training data set. And then the ASR work package will use this data set. And,, we will also,, transcribe the data that we need to tr, to transcribe. So for example, if we know who will be the main speaker at the conference,, we can get some of his old speeches and transcribe these and thus get data for,, the speaker adaptation. So this is this is a task where the main partner should be ORGANIZATION12 because they know how to process the data. But,, we will, for example,, purchase the equipment to the recordings. And for the re-speakers. And ORGANIZATION11 will probably do the,, same. If ORGANIZATION5 would like also to have,, some of the re-speakers,, then. Like, a f coming from their side. Then,, they, they w might,, enter themselves. There is one related thing, so let me jump ahead in the agenda. In the,, ORGANIZATION1 sheet,, there is this,,, there is this budget,, the third sheet,, in this in this ORGANIZATION1 document, is like a collection of,, hours and,, number of speakers that we would like to record data from. That's for the adaptation purposes. And also the number of speakers or re-speakers that we want to have,, present at the conferences and workshops to actually do the re-speaking. And I've added only,, some for OTHER7 and,, some for OTHER5, and I actually,, forgot to include the OTHER5,, for the purpose of sitting at the conference. So I would like to ask especially ORGANIZATION12,, to, to add any lines,, for them. If they need,, to,,, if they need to,, record some,, specific persons, And if they,, want to, if they want us to do it, like so that it goes through our budget, that's also possible. So,, like then it, then,, enter us,, as,,, having the people in,, And here in the comments say that like this is for ORGANIZATION12 experiments,, or,, whatever. So we can do the, the recording for you, because we probably will need the re-speakers,, primarily in LOCATION1. But,, you,,, may have specific ideas,, like how many hours do you need per person. These numbers are now,, based on,, the estimates,, that PERSON12 provided me with. And PERSON12 is also, PERSON12 als should also put here some lines for,, for ORGANIZATION11 here, because they also want to focus on OTHER9, so there will be some speaker adaptation for OTHER9,,, as well. And one more thing. If you decide to actually run the, the recording at your side is that,, preferably, the speakers should,, also be recorded in a genuine re-speaking session, because then the voice is different for, due to the pressure,, that's put on the speaker. So,, so ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION12, please, consider,, how many hours do we need in the project, and how many hours do you want to record,, yourself. If you do not want to record yourself, then,, say that we should do the recording. And this will give us the total,, number of person-months. This is the total number of hours, which is something that the ASR people should check whether this is sufficient or. Well, this is a this is for also the attendance of the conferences. So,, for the for the adaptation, you should check whether these numbers are sufficient. And,, for the number of person-months per partner, this is something which contributes to the budget. So,, then this is the number that w I will add or you will add to the data work package,, and, this will then,, get po, propagated,, to the number of, number of hours here, and that will,, like,, contribute,, to the budget. Okay? So it's that clear? ORGANIZATION5 and,, and ORGANIZATION12?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "Sorry LOCATION1, I suppose one general question about the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Data operation is whether we need - Whether we need to have as a personnel budget or a subcontracting budget? As we were here we were thinking about the translation test sets, but -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Could apply to the speaker or at least -",
            "Yeah,,",
            "I'm not really -",
            "So, I dunno. Yeah, I don't have,, any opinion on this. So I think that subcontracting is covered as well. It's probably,,, just a different,, box in the in the proposal. So, -",
            "It's something you should you should -",
            "Announce.",
            "At proposal time. And -",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "We were very. They're not really like subcontracting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I expect to be difficult if you want to add extra subcontracters personnel's subcontracting, that's not really -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Possible. Probably -",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Personnel possible.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So for us, s, for us,, it's probably easier to have it as personal upfront,, because we can handle this, we do handle the number of annotators. That large numbers of annotators anyway. So they do it for us. If you if you yourself would like to have this as subcontracts, then,,, in this table, -",
            "So I think -",
            "I s. Yep?",
            "And I think we prob wouldn't produce any re-speaker data ourselves,, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Comes around that I think talk about who creates us the test sets, and we can we should also discuss that.",
            "Yeah, s that's that's a good question. So if, if it turns out that,, some data should be gathered,, like outside of LOCATION1, And,, ORGANIZATION5 or ORGANIZATION12 would like to do it through subcontracting, please,, say so here in the comment, and I'll see that, and I'll,, like make sure that these person-months are not there yet and but somehow,, we should have,, an estimate on the costs of that. So, if you make it a subcontracting, then, - Ours total. Yeah, well, I'll modify this sheet, this sheet is flexible, this is this is something that we can get away. So, so then maybe just create a column like \"This is subcontracting and it will be this mu this much Euros.\" And I'll create a summary table that assembles the subcontractings, And I'm like make sure that the person-months,, are not like added as person-months, but rather only as the subcontracting. So the subcontracting will not go through,, the ORGANIZATION4, the subcontracting would go directly into this table, into the,, into this part.",
            "The re-speakers that gonna be at the conference?",
            "Yes, so the res and workshops. So the workshops. That's there is the main event conference. And,, we said that we want at least one,, event,, before that,, and that could be like a smaller scale and that will be mainly the OTHER5,,, held discussion. But it's non-native speakers,, w and we need to adapt to them. And we have the re-speakers,, to, to help this,,, to help the event run event to run smoothly, So there is one before the conference, then there are several during the conference, when the plenary session is not running, And then,, in the proposal, we currently estimate that there will be 2 afterwards. Either during, one of them during already the 2nd year,, and one in the 3rd year or 2 in the 3rd year or something like that. So - Yeah.",
            "Just does that mean that so I suppose the problem is that if we hire re-speaker, we would have to get them out of LOCATION1? Which is also -",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "Problematic. So I don't know which of those options that's the easier?",
            "So I think it's,, it's it's easier if we do it, if we find the re-speaker, and if like you as ASR experts will say: \"We need the f to handle the conference and the workshops in the amount as like outline in the proposal, We have to have this many re-speakers, and for each re-speaker we have to have this many hours so that the system can adapt to that. ”. PERSON12 mentioned that this,, depends on the ASR system, like the number of hours that you need per person. And then,, you will say that we should,, find the re-speakers, and record it for them and we will do it. And it will be persons located in LOCATION1, and hopefully they will not get sick on the on the important days.",
            "Yeah,, okay,, so please populate this table,, and feel free to enter even like non-standard,,, information. Like,, \"I want someone else to do it, but I need this to be done\" and all that. So don't worry about that, but make sure the information gets, gets in there. So that was the 1st task and let's, let's proceed. So there is the 2nd task is calling external resources for machine translation and spoken language translation. And this is,, Yeah, this is the downloading work and,, polishing,, work for,, the MT part. I don't know whether we should have a separate task. We probably should. On like creating the ASR,, the training data, because the plan is that we will not really record,, and create any new transcripts,, for training data except for s adaptation,, for ASR. So for ASR we should rely on available data sets. But there may be some work needed to k polish them, accurate them,, for the purposes,, of the project. So this would be on ORGANIZATION12 to add such a task. And maybe ORGANIZATION5,, a t and to estimate how many person-months should, should be devoted to that. So,, yeah. There could be one more task. PERSON7, maybe if you could,,, could take a note and add it, Or if you think that this can be like easily done,, and doesn't need a task here,, that's also possible, but I think it's it's better to have that in. Okay? Then,, there is some,, non-trivial time for,, the minuting data. For the minuting data, we need to record,, or gather existing,, online meetings. And manually revise the transcript. So we should gather transcripts from some ASR system, but we should we should revise them. And we should a create,, or collect and polish the,, documents related to that. So the agendas and the minutes afterwards, and make it a data set. Both training and test data set,, for the purposes of minuting. So this is like major,, preliminary,, work before the research on minuting can begin. The deliverables here,, are. Yeah?",
            "Point to the test sets. Shouldn't we include that maybe in task 1.1 or so? Becau if we anyway collect this adaptation and development data, It would make sense to directly include the test sets, because they should be from the same domain and -",
            "Yes, yes, yes, that's good. So I when I wrote this, I thought that like test sets will be then taken out as a part of, from the data. But it's g actually better to,, explicitly say so in the task description. So, so please, add that comment,, here to the description to the short description,, And especially to the long description of, of the task. This is a kind of reflected in the, in the deliverables here. Because in the deliverables, I say that we'll release a the training data twice,, for all the,, various,, activities or the or the technologies. The 1st develop, 1st release will be,, very early, at month 6 already, So that we can use the data for training,, the systems for the ORGANIZATION14,, Congress. And the 2nd release will be towards the,, end of the project, well, at the end of year 2. So that,, the year th 3, models can be,, recreated on the much and large data sets. So this is the training data, and for test sets, I actually planned to have 3,, different test sets. And 1 on end of month 10,, then month 20 and month 30, to give us enough time,, to use these test sets,, for the evaluation. And I kind of assume that these test set would, would like be, be obtained for free,, by taking parts of, of,, the data collected in these tasks. But we should say so explicitly mainly for ourselves. So that we never release something in the training data that we want to use in the test set afterwards. Yeah. So that's that's a good,,, good comment. And then,, the corpus of the minutes,, is a task which is directly, a deliverable directly related to the task 1.3. So that's, that's the training data for the,, summarization. And,, wherever possible,, we will release the data,, in a public form,, but there will probably be a 2nd,,, level of deployment that will be within the consortium and,, as you know from the other part of,, of the proposal, there is also some data,, which will,, be deleted,, s, after the project. Well, there's there's other part of the data that will be published,, but only with some delay. So this is something which is already outside of the time spent of the,, project. So there is no associated deliverable with that. And,,, at the end of the project we will simply know which data are fine to be,, released now, and which data need to wait. Yeah. Okay? So, any comments on this? If not then let's move quickly. The time is really running up. Actually, we have 2 hours on this go-to-meeting. But I'm not sure, whether all of you have 2 hours,,, yourself. So,, that's,, why we should, we should rush. Let's move on to work package 2. And I'd like to ask PERSON7 to briefly present,, the plans here. I know it's not yet written, but what will be written when it's written..",
            "Yeah. I can try it, I mean,, it's not my main thing, since it's ASR and mainly it's done by PERSON17 to keep there. I try to do it. So I mean, we s have the other 3 tasks for the ASR, Where we think is like the main thing we have to,, improve to get really to the thing that we can use it in the conferences. The one thing is,,, the robust acoustic modeling, so improving the br robustness. A for example also for,, accents and things like that. And we have task 2.2, s and supervised semi-supervised the language model adaptation. And then finally 2.3, the lifelong learning during deployment, especially if we have something like key words or in the ORGANIZATION6 where it's used over time. The system should improve over time and get some feedback, and the system should get used to the speakers and get better. And that's mainly done in 2.3. So it's 3 different things we want to improve in the ASR in order to get ready performance which can be used in all the used cases we address.",
            "Yeah, so one thing that, Thanks for this brief summary. The one thing that is missing already on this page is the deliverables. So do you have any plans what will be the structure of deliverables? Like would it be a yearly reports, or?",
            "Yes, I guess something like that. I have to talk in detail, but I mean, either we do it by task, so not a report about everything, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But like by task, all we do is summary and then. I do not know if we need yearly or like twice, like after half -",
            "Twice.",
            "Of the project.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then -",
            "Yeah.",
            "At the end of the project, something like that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in with deliverables, it is probably wise to try to spread them,,, across months,, so that we don't have,, like,, high,,, s high peaks of too many deliverables that have to be delivered at the same month. And one thing, which is very much, s. It's now refreshing. Which is very much related to this,, is the timing of the tasks. And,, when this appears, eventually, I'll actually I'll probably download it as a PDF, so then we can browse it safer. So here is the is the timing. No, not any better. Yeah, so the timing here,, seems kind of very tentative for this work package. It seems that you will have a gap,, around,, the conference. Maybe that's intentional, maybe not, so -",
            "Now I think that -",
            "So make sure that. Yeah?",
            "Initial, yeah. I mean -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think most of the thing will be over longer time, maybe life-long learning will start a little bit later, and then be. But it's mainly more it will be more similar to work package 3 where mainly everything is done,, over -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The whole time.",
            "Yeah, okay. So thank you. So now let's move to work package 3, which is,, spoken language translation. And that's like in the middle, realized in both ASR and, and,, machine translation. So,, PERSON1, or PERSON15, can you please present that?",
            "So we have 3 tasks. Tasks 3.1 would, To transcript normalization trying to do together the ASR output and the machine translation system. It's quite standard.",
            "I'm yeah, I'm not doing anything, it's. Sorry.",
            "And 3.2 is,, trying to make the,, machine translation systems more robust towards noise in the input. We're thinking about things like looking at different architectures language representation, maybe latest input, output, also other things to make the whole thing quality when the when there is noise like speech dissfluencies or ASR, have less impact. And the 3rd task 3.3 will be end-to-end speech-to-text translation. The most research here with the 3,, tasks. It would bypass having separate ASR and MT systems.",
            "Yeah. And the deliverables? Thank you.",
            "We have 3 prototypes, roughly 1 per year, with the last 1 a bit earlier. We are a bit worried what these will contain. I assume the 1st prototype will mainly have transcript normalization. And we're and later, we will try to add,, also end-to-end speech and text translation systems. And,, two reports. One in the middle, one at the end of the project.",
            "Yeah,, so this is,, something that needs to be aligned with the integration in some way. So we should be aware of the linguist, the integration work package somehow. So, so,, check with,, PERSON12,, and,, maybe align the prototypes with, Or yeah, I d I don't know how to structure that, whether it, what the integration so far is, is like continuous, it doesn't say,, too many,, specific milestones. And you have definitely more milestones and, r deliverables that, than they have. So just make sure that these,, 2 things are in line.",
            "Okay.",
            "One question. D I mean just what I mean, can we just write \"prototype\"? Or do we have to specify who mis submitting it? Or if it's like which language pair and all these things? Or is it. I dunno. Or is it enough to just write \"prototype\"?",
            "Well, so didn't like -",
            "Why did you. Maybe I didn't see it, sorry.",
            "Yeah. So the, the languages are,,, kind of promised here at the very beginning,, within the object -",
            "Is all ready.",
            "If we say a prototype, do we have to build a prototype for all language pairs? Or can it be? Because maybe that's a lot, I don't know, or can we also say only some languages? Or I dunno.",
            "I would be make -",
            "I would assume as long we don't make a promise there, we can define ourselves what extent we want -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Prototypes to be. That's -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's definitely good.",
            "Yeah. So, exactly, I would. So the 1st prototype could be prototype because it's the full technology, but it likes most languages. The 2nd prototype could be all languages, but lacking the technology or someth. I think we,, should leave ourselves the flexibility. In general,, this is,, Yeah, yeah. Is, in general, this, there is,, like,, s types of languages. There is the primary focus, there is the covered languages which we promised to deliver, so that ORGANIZATION14 knows that they can use it. And, But we are not promising that the technology,, advances is used for these languages. So,, like we could use standard,, models and the quality will obviously suffer,, but we're flexible in terms of how much,, we we actually meant it. Something which we do not even promise that we'll do all. We can try,, but,, it will be mainly probes of languages. So,, PERSON1 s, suggested to include languages,, that have some business reason. And that's a question for,, ORGANIZATION6,, where the, whether dissemination is,,, possible. Like what woul what would you expect, what languages would be would be needed? The ones that I listed so far,, was OTHER2 because it's one of the ORGANIZATION8 language, and it has some data available. I've also listed OTHER6 because, -",
            "It. Yep? ORGANIZATION6? Please, go on.",
            "Yes,, no, I mean, PERSON16, are you listening? Can you, the stage already say something to that point? Yeah, apparently not.",
            "Yeah, so if PERSON16 is not -",
            "Not here at the moment -",
            "Excuse me, I was I was interrupted here, locally. So can you say the question again?",
            "What languages would be of interest for ORGANIZATION6 for a for,, business reasons. So we are like. If you see the screen now. This is very early. This is already the objective,, the very first part of the proposal. And here,, I say that in the experimental set of languages we have actually all,, possible languages. Well, OTHER8 is not there actually. So, I would like to refine with examples what languages we are likely to focus on from this,, experimental set, or even beyond that experimental set. So this is,,, something that ORGANIZATION6 could, could provide us with input.",
            "Yeah, so currently we're, we have the OTHER5 language and the OTHER4 language, but we can easily,, adapt to other languages. So we have a, a word-file and we can integrate where. And the user interface can be easily updated with other languages. When it comes to -",
            "Implementing the text-to-speech and the other,,, features, we are open. I mean, -",
            "Yeah, so the question is if you could ask for any, what languages would you ask for? And not for technical reason but for business reasons. So maybe that's another question for PERSON16.",
            "I would I would go for I would go for languages,, in the order of how they are commonly used. So this would OTHER5 at 1st, and then I guess OTHER1 and so forth. I'm not quite sure, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well OTHER8 would be great but I think you already mentioned that,, this is not,, included at the moment, not planned.",
            "Yeah, so if you have like if you would have some concrete plans to go,, for OTHER1. Sorry for OTHER8. Then,, we can put that in here, and that will kind of excuse us in case if we indeed do it. If we do not mention OTHER8 here, it will be very hard to, to defend it afterwards.",
            "Okay,, well, I mean, we are already,, happy with all languages that you are, well, provided, that you which you've mentioned before, So,, for as for business reasons we do not have to include another languages at this stage.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. So PERSON1 will probably just remove your comment because we don't have any things that's. So maybe, or maybe, well, OTHER4 is already primary focus, so yeah.",
            "But still I feel that the reviewers see - will see little bit of OTHER6, because at WSLT relation. That's not the -",
            "Yeah, okay, okay. So you should ha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the idea is that we should remove OTHER6 from this list.",
            "Yeah, maybe remove OTHER6 from this list, yeah. Maybe we can still to do it, but just for -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I guess ORGANIZATION3 -",
            "Yeah, yeah. I thi -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's sti what's exactly, it's one of the ORGANIZATION3 languages, and, and LOCATION2 is one of the countries who are, if I'm not mistaken, like trying to, to have discussions with the ORGANIZATION2 to potentially join them. I'm I'm not really sure about this, but I think so. So,, it may not be a, as strange as, as it seems, but it depends on the on the reviewer obviously, how, how knowledgeable they are about the yo ORGANIZATION2 very long-term policies or plans. Okay? So let's move,, on,, to the work package on multilingual machine translation. Here I put a task, which is,, the 1st task. Obviously, well, the goal of this work package is to,, support the, the project with the machine translation service,, and do the research in machine translation. So the 1st task, task,, 4.1 is the,, baseline supporting thing, and there I put,, ourselves, ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION12,, to train domain-dependent separate systems. And this task is actually,,, planned very,, early in the. Do I have it somewhere? That's strange, I thought I have I had the PDF,, somewhere, but it. For some reason. No. Yep. Well, I'm already looking at the PDF. So let's let's open this part as well. This task is planned very early in the project. So that it this baseline system can,, be used,, to test the integration and t. Where are they? Yeah, that's is the set of task. It's, so the baseline models should be worked on for, during the 1st half of the,, half of the 1st year. And,, not any further. So that's the,, that's the idea. So we should quickly do the baseline. And I'm here,, quite specific about,, the languages. And,, k I would like to check,, with ORGANIZATION12 and ORGANIZATION5 whether they can propose any better wording so that we are not that specific, But yet,,, we are specific enough for the reviewer to like the task description. So let's not discuss this, -",
            "But - Now, simply add comments. Or if you if you can say it quickly, say so now but w I think that we are just -",
            "Trying to find the wording.",
            "Yes, several langua. Also, I don't know if we need to build all them as single systems, or just can. For several of the pairs. Can directly go to a multi-target or something. Because it's just huge computation and we don't really gain anything. We can just select a representative subset of the language pairs, build their translation systems, and then for the rest only go for the multilingual systems.",
            "Yeah. So the reason. Yeah, so if there is. So maybe the wording should be changed, that if,, the multi-target,, is available in some way, and you say it is, we c we will,, consider it, But this is like the baseline, and the baseline search 2 purposes. 1 of the person, purposes is to deliver the MT to ORGANIZATION11 into the integration, So that it's actually available for the conference, for the dry-run event and for the for the conference. And the other,, purpose is to have baselines for the, for the research,,, afterwards. So how much do we lose of the performance,, if we,, put more languages together, and and other things. Or if we actually improve the, the performance,, in terms of translation quality. When we put, put the languages together. So,, I think we have to cover all target,, languages, all the ORGANIZATION3 ones, at some minimum level. I'm totally,, open to like having some of them covered by multilingual systems already. So pl feel free to modify this wording of the task, because you're you're involved in the task,, anyway. And,,, ts. Yeah. Yeah, so thanks for thanks for your suggestion and let's reword this. And if you if we can find if, a wording that is not as specific as I'm now,, but still specific enough, then even better. Okay? The next task is called document level translation. And there is,,, entering high quality of machine transition beyond,, level of individual sentences. Here, the focus is, it's it's not clear whether it is for speech or for text. And I think I should probably explicitly say that it is for both. They are different,, like discourse phenomena,, happening in speech, and different discourse, or longer,, text phenomena,, happening in text. So we should,, focus on both. In terms of timing, this task is the one that runs through all the 3 years. And then,, the other tasks are on multi-tar,, or om on the multi-languages-mul multiple languages. First,, we focus on the multi-target. And the reason is that we have the conference,, coming in the middle of,, 2nd in the s, in the middle of 2nd year. And for the conference, we need to translate from 6,, or how many languages. Into all the 44 if, or the 43 if possible. So this task multi-target runs in the 1st year. And then is kind of used,,, in the middle of the,, 2nd year, but the research has been concluded by the end of the 1st year. The 2nd year of the research is focused on the multi-source. And here, the primary,,, goal is to gain in translation quality,, when we are training on more source languages. And,, then, the final task,, which is planned for the 3rd year, is called flexible multilingual machine translation. So I've slightly changed this,, from the original,, division into task that we had into the ORGANIZATION1 doc. The flexible multilingual machine translation,, is,, designing in an system architecture that is capable of translating from 1 or more languages at the same time,, and,, into 1 or more languages on the target site. And,, the input should be flexible. If you have only 1 input,, language, then feed in 1, if you have 2 if you already have 2 versions of the document, feed 2, and the system should gracefully,, handle that and benefit from the additional,, source. So the difference between this multi-source and this flexible multilingual is that in the multi-source you always expect multi parallel input. If you have multiple inputs. Or,, that you focus only on 1 language 1 source language and but train on others and try to benefit from the multi-task. So the multi-source machine translation is either 1 input or multiple input, Whereas the flexible multilingual is any subset of the languages at once. So far, I do not have any deliverables planned here, and I think I'll simply mimic the, the reporting. So it's,, based on the,, on the timing by year. I think that having yearly reports is probably the most appropriate thing, and I don't think there will be,, any. Well, yes, there should the deliverable on the baseline MT models. So there should be 1 deliverable on the baseline MT models, and there should be the yearly reports. And that's probably it. Okay? So then the, then the task on minuting. And this is something that, yeah, I've done partly with, for. The main contribution comes from my colleague PERSON9. So I'll try to briefly summarize this, but I'm not sure,, I'll,, do it,, totally correctly,, so - PERSON20.",
            "Yeah, okay, so. Let's let me interrupt the, this presentation and let -",
            "PERSON20?",
            "Yep? You are also going to leave?",
            "I'm going to leave as well, yes. So,, I just wanted to add that we will,, add further information to the work package 7, and,, my colleges told me that you wanted to,, meet with,, ORGANIZATION11 tomorrow.",
            "Yes.",
            "We will be not office tomorrow, but maybe we can arrange something that,, will -",
            "Remote.",
            "Add the passages and all the texts and we will go through it. Could you tell us,, when you will need the answer by the latest?",
            "Y w yeah, so well, I will I will merged it during the weekend, but I don't know when. So I think it will not be like a set of question and set of answers. So,, try to provide the input to PERSON12 early in the day or even today, and then he will probably ask and you should have a look and try to answer. I'll send an email,, to find,, out if there is any time,, point where we could like meet,, remotely, remotely. Yeah,, okay. So let me let me then quickly, quickly present at least this. So the gaps in the introductory sections. So,, I've seen that most of the people,, have already partner descriptions. It would be good if could,, list 2 persons per partner in this, in this setting. And then,,, for the, So that's like the actually the tail,, section of the proposal, and there is the introductory sections. Everybody please read and comment the objectives,, the relation to the work program and also the early parts of the concept. The methodology needs a lot of polishing. Sorry. And,, I would suggest to do this like by 2 partners in for each of the,, paragraphs in there. So the remote conferencing is something that,, comes originally from ORGANIZATION6. I've edited it. So maybe if ORGANIZATION12 could review whether this makes sense. The,, ASR,, the state of the on ASR is missing, so I would like to ask ORGANIZATION12,, to write it and review it by ORGANIZATION5, Or the other way around if ORGANIZATION5 is still available and ORGANIZATION12 is busy. The machine translation is still incomplete, so I'll finish that. It's it's a bit sorry, but it's not finished. And I will probably ask would like to ask ORGANIZATION5 to like we review that. And,, the,, spoken language translation is written by ORGANIZATION5,, I believe, and so I'll review that. The summarization is,, probably quite finished. I haven't talked to PERSON9, but there is a lot of text. So maybe if ORGANIZATION5 or ORGANIZATION12.",
            "Till when do you need it?",
            "Th well,, over the weekend?",
            "Yeah, I think can have look at least. I don't know if I can do it over the weekend or on Monday, but I'll try to do it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. So I should I should. I dunno if PERSON1 is still here. But I'll write ORGANIZATION12. Remember, PERSON7, that you, you need to write your sections as well. Then there is a section on minuting tools. And I think that it would be great if ORGANIZATION6,, could review this, because they would see what is out there, and where is the room for their potential product. So, that's maybe for PERSON20? I dunno if PERSON16 is still -",
            "Yeah, can ca yeah, I'm listening, I'm I can do that.",
            "O.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I'll remove the question marks and. Well, PERSON1 was silent and that means that he was fine with that. So I'll remove the question marks. And then there is a section on handling humans. So I would like everyone, especially ORGANIZATION6,,, but,, everyone to, to see whether this,, makes sense, yeah. And then, the concept is still rather weak,, so if ORGANIZATION6, while populating they their,, dissemination work package, can provide further activities. The ambition is missing, so I'll,, s I'll,, try to, to cr to write one, and early next week,, it should be ready for, for review by someone, so. And the expected impact has many impacts that I proposed. So I would like everyone to review them, to t like think about them whether they make sense,, or not. And possibly to, to suggest more. And I will,, finish,, this section,, as well. And the impact maximization,, thanks to ORGANIZATION6 for their paragraph. So I'll I'll maybe restructure it,, a little bit,, but I would like to ask ORGANIZATION6 to derive specific tasks from this. So the work-package on, on dissemination is very unpopulated yet. So I'm suggesting that you could derive tasks such as managing social media, so promoting the project and the research results,, and that should run for some months, and there should be some description of this. And you mentioned local press releases, so again if you could provide any details. And you mentioned C, ORGANIZATION7 or ORGANIZATION7. Then,, my question is whether we can actually promise to be there? Is it just a question of money? Or is there some competition that you have to win in order to be able to,, present there? And if it's just a question of money, should the budget be,, allocated for that? So this is all for ORGANIZATION6,, because I would like ORGANIZATION6 to populate the, the,, dissemination work package. The website is something very easy to,, to do and,, yes, they we'll have the website. But there is other tasks that you have listed, suggested, but,, they need to be also in the tasks. So ORGANIZATION6, can you can you confirm that, -",
            "As we, we will form this with the months,, we will give them more details. And I think we can,, technically go to the ORGANIZATION7. I donno, I've sent you an email about the marketing bu, budgets. Maybe you can -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Have a look.",
            "Yes, sorry, that's. I remember that you have e reminded me of that, yeah. So,, I think,, the short answer is that,, everything which makes sense, is like good value for money for the ORGANIZATION2, is okay. So I b so I haven't I sent you that in one of the project,, the10 000 Euros in the end were spent,, on some like promotion video. This is something very uncommon. But if it makes sense, it is probably,, okay to put such a thing there as well. I thought that I've written that e-mail. Maybe it ended up in my drafts only and not,, yeah. So,, think for yourself and,, of think for yourself as a,, ORGANIZATION2 tax payer, what makes sense. And,, then propose any specific activities and propose them not only in the pros, but also as tasks. And if you have any technical issues, then send me a list that \"I would like to have this task running for these months\" and I'll fix that. But,, the structure, the structured information is important.",
            "Okay, alright.",
            "Yeah,, okay. So that was that was the list of kind of to-do lists, and,, then, yeah. We ha we have been discussing deliverables. And,, we h I've already started discussing this, the recordings and the hours, hours of usage of re-speakers. So,,, we are now, we have quickly jumped through the rest of the agenda. So please, use this list and do what is necessary. And those of you who have to depart,, you probably may depart now,, otherwise, if you still can stay on, please stay on, because we will,, get to the integration and the dissemination as it is now. So, who is leaving? And who is staying?",
            "We're leaving, bye, PERSON20. Yeah, I also have to leave.",
            "Yeah, thank you, thanks. Bye.",
            "Okay. ORGANIZATION12 is also gone. And,, can,, someone from ORGANIZATION6 stay? Because I know I know that,, PERSON11 was leaving.",
            "PERSON21 has left,, I can stay -",
            "Okay.",
            "But I'm I'm not able to say anything to the technical,, details.",
            "Yeah, that's that's not a problem. And PERSON16?",
            "Yeah, I'm still here.",
            "Okay, yeah. So let's, let's make use of this because now it's only me and,, ORGANIZATION6. Let's make use,, of this time to discuss the,, dissemination work package. So we, Or, well, actually,, that's perfect timing. So,, here,, the minuting. So I'm not going to talk about,, how do we want to do the minuting under the hood, Which is the discourse segmentation, segment-level summarization, document level summarization, and sequence to structure. Maybe the sequence to structure. So the. To give you a big,, overview of what we want to do is that we will,, have a transcript coming from the ASR, and this transcript will be first like split into individual items, And then these items will be shortened,, and then some of these items will be removed,,, because they are not important for the summary of that, of that,,, discussion. And then,, these shortened,, and,, s reduced in number it, items will be,, put into the structure that was created, that comes from the agenda already. So this is this is an overview of what the tasks are supposed to do. And there is one task, which I planned,, to be a direct collaboration between you and,, us. And I call it the Live minutes platform. And this is something that I need to,, check with you, whether you would like to work on this, and whether you,, indeed do want to have many person-months on this. I've I've put there quite a few,, 24. So well, 24 is the total, but you don't have involvement in at a in another of task. So that's like for the live platform. And my idea as a potential user of this would be that, while we are talking, I'll be,,,, I'll have also like one more tab, which will be the live document, and this live document would have the transcript,, appearing at the bottom, And then at the top, there will be the agenda and the agenda would get populated automatically as we speak,, and as the system decides that something is important. And something belongs here and there. So the question is,, this live document, it's like redoing ORGANIZATION1 docs or doing a plug-in for ORGANIZATION1 docs. How much of the programming for this would you like to do? What should be the promised result for the ORGANIZATION2? And how much,, of,,, of this,, online,, part, like how much live should it be from the technical point of view? We could run it in the baseline mode, where we get the transcript offline and we offline create the summary and populate the agenda and this document one short will be shipped to the participants by email. And that's that's a perfect solution as well. But if you,, are interested in getting ORGANIZATION2 money for developing this online interface. And the live,,, capacity, then this is the place to put it. So what is your,, take on this?",
            "So, first of all, the, the output of the of the live minutes,, comes from your side, right? So -",
            "So what i what is the output? The output is the summary, right?",
            "The raw the raw data that should be displayed, for example -",
            "The raw data.",
            "In a in a in a ORGANIZATION1 doc.",
            "Yes, yes, the raw data is something which will come from a research prototype that we will develop and I have obviously no -",
            "So why -",
            "Idea how -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, how this will be good for practice.",
            "So,, why don't you access the ORGANIZATION1 API and then put it put it into a into a ORGANIZATION1 doc?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Why -",
            "Who put it yeah?",
            "That's like a that's the baseline solution, and that's what -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But if you saw it as like a nice extension to the ORGANIZATION6 platform, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So that the document is part of,, the environment of ORGANIZATION6, then it makes sense for you to develop that and we -",
            "Okay.",
            "Will be interfacing you. So that's -",
            "I understand -",
            "Something we have -",
            "But -",
            "Yeah.",
            "But that would require us to have a, you know, a coll kind of a collaboration tool inside the ORGANIZATION6 client.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So -",
            "Yes.",
            "That would be preliminary work. We would have to do and it is quite it is quite a big thing, so. I'm I'm having this something similar t like a ORGANIZATION1 doc,.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "It is I think it's not doable within the scope of this project. So we would have to look for something that we can adapt to, maybe an existing open source project, which allows for -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Coedi co-editing, which can also be integrated into the ORGANIZATION6 client. And we have not done any research on that yet.",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
            "So this could be this could be a potential,, outlet for the,, meeting minutes data, that is true.",
            "And I would also like to see that. And not have to go to a ORGANIZATION1 doc for that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So do you think that 2 years would be too little? Or,, or even if we say that it needs the preliminary work, it would be the full 3 years, So that you would,, -",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
            "Allocate. Well, I know that there is shortage of programmers,, across LOCATION3 I believe.",
            "Yeah. I mean the. It's I think it's not a matter of time. It's it's just how many, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Workforce you put behind this. I mean, 3 years sounds long, but,, if you reduce it to the to the man-hours here,, some co-editing tool is yeah, it's quite a task. So I think we'll have to do some more research on that.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "How it's finally gonna be like. I mean, if we if we add a co-editing feature -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "That is not within the scope of this project, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Then I could yeah, I could I could think of,, using it for this project. If we come up with a with the co-editing solution, especially for this project, I think it will be something quite,, basic, okay?",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's alright. I think it's that's totally okay for, to have it like,, the co-editing. The core word processor that is edited by more people at once -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Could be,, any basic,, thing. So,, the task, if it is if it if there is any task,, as such,, at all, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Can say that,, first during the first year, we will investigate what are the online solutions, because we are aware of the fact how much effort it takes to develop ORGANIZATION1 docs. Or if we want to interface one of the existing ones, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Or if ORGANIZATION6 decides to develop on their own,, their,, one, if that would be the good,, one.",
            "Mm-hmm. So the like design of the interfacing with that,, and then in the 2nd year, implementing the interfacing to whatever,, we decide to use. And if -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "If we in the 1st year, if we find that there is no such solution that we should sta we can start from,, we will, we can even,, do like a change in the,, in the plan.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So,,, I think we can we can easily extend this task,, this task as you see it now on the on the screen, is like,, 2 lines,,,, and it's it's very unfinished. So,, it's. We can, we can add,, a few more ideas here and we can change it, so it find,, solutions for the editor,, prop design interfacing with the editor,, and,, implement this,, integration and evaluate it throughout the 3 years. And there is also an associated,, longer part of this, as you know, before,, these tables. And the longer part is not written yet at all. And this longer part,,, that can be v even a page of text,, saying,: \"All the complications that we see at the moment and all the challenges that need to be,, resolved.\" I think Open office had, had some opened,,,",
            "S I'm not sure. Yeah, so,, so -",
            "Yeah, I'm afraid it's not gonna be as easy as that because we have to lo, make a l, take a look at,, you know, the interface. It's gonna -",
            "Yes.",
            "It is it's gonna be a C + +, application. We cannot use make use of,, web-based tools at this point and.",
            "Well, 10 minutes will be enough to add the links to the potential,,, s tools to the proposal. And then,, the task should review them, and this review is a planned activity that should run for the 2 or 3 months even. Part of this task.",
            "Okay..",
            "So does that make sense? Like it's, -",
            "That's point. I would put more effort in potential solutions.",
            "Yeah, so this is like examples. So y.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, so it's not that -",
            "Okay, I see. Okay, okay, I see.",
            "So, so we are saying: \"We plan we want to have this g live document that gets automatically populated and at the moment we don't know how to,, do the live document at all., we know that there is these 3 solutions, but at the moment, we have not really checked the details and,, some of them may become -",
            "Alright, I see. Okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Mm-hmm, okay.",
            "So if you could if you could write this text, either in the ORGANIZATION4 or in a separate ORGANIZATION1 doc or the anywhere, -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "That would be great because I need the input from ORGANIZATION6. I need to know what is your thinking about this,, And you mentioned that you are potentially planning to have -",
            "Yeah.",
            "This live document,, the shared space.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So that should be there as well. And it's totally okay to say that ORGANIZATION6 is still considering a j is still only considering that feature -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Because,, it is risky, it is a lot of effort -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And other competitors have that partly, but they don't have the obviously the conferencing thing.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So it's it's still a business decision to make.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But for the project,, we if ORGANIZATION6 doesn't decide to do it on their own -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Then we will find a substitute solution. And even as a fallback, we will do it like with some baseline,, solution.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I think it's, it's it makes sense to have this task, because it, it will show the,,, the overall results,, of this to the user.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And that's that's something which, which is very good for the proposal.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I agree, it the output of this live minutes, I mean, it's basic it's it's the essence of this whole project, right? And it has to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Has to live on a kind of stage and not just -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Be put somewhere and yeah.",
            "Yeah, in the deliverables, in the in the reports that we -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. So here,, the, the reports that I planned here are exactly 2 research reports. Oh, sorry. That's it's crazy it's scrolling for like. I'm not doing anything but it's the button is stuck. So,, I had this initial report of summarization at month 18, in the middle of the project, And final report on the summarization on the on the,, back-end,, technologies,, And all the problems they have. And I also have,, the, the, the proposed deliverable,, to, for the software,, so we can rename it in any way. So we can call it like a Demonstrator,, which is the standard word used,,, And the demonstrator in the longer description of the ta. Like this would be the result of task 5.5, and the longer description would say that,, \"At the moment we cannot really say what the Demonstrator will be based on because that will be the research of the 1st months of the project.\" And there is an associated milestone, which will be like,, at the end of year 1. Decide what is the platform for, for this demonstrator. And then in year 2, the integration with that will be, will be implemented,, and year 2 and 3, the implementation, the integration will be implemented and tested. So does that sound reasonable?",
            "Yep.",
            "Yeah, so if you yeah, if you can please create this task description. I'll make,, sure that we cover the other task and I'll make sure that I integrate the text from you, but,, the more you write,, the better. Yeah, and I'll I'll yeah, I'll I'll polish that in anyway,.",
            "PERSON20?",
            "Yeah?",
            "Would that be possible for you to add the task description?",
            "Yeah, we could work together. Or we should work together at the on this thing. I will do the basic research but maybe you can add bring it in form.",
            "Yeah. And,, regarding,, generally our edition to the ORGANIZATION4, PERSON20.",
            "Yep.",
            "We will be out of office until Monday, so -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "We will have a chance to add a the content on Monday. Would that be okay for you? Oh well, I mean it's for us it's difficult, I don't think that we will have a chance to add today any details,, overview -",
            "Yeah. And any documents and,, tomorrow we are not here so, -",
            "Yeah, so it is -",
            "We will -",
            "Yeah.",
            "On Monday if you like, that would be,, if you think that will be a good idea, but,, just so that you know that,, we cannot -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Work, -",
            "Yeah, it's all it's all online, so if you, if you talk with PERSON16 directly and if you create a force like if it makes things easier for you if you create a separate ORGANIZATION1 doc with this task description and you edit it online with PERSON16, then I'll can at least see it during the weekend and I can write texts, other parts of the text based on what -",
            "But -",
            "What I see in the, in the proposal, which c, can help me. If you -",
            "Really cannot work, if you are offline,, and you do not plan to work on this,, then yes, just give it to me on Monday, like what else?",
            "No, we c we can s instruct a thing on Monday, but we will not be able to work on that until Monday, it's just that you know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, so the sooner I get it,, from you the better. And the form is not that important. If you do it in the ORGANIZATION4 that's great because it save my time. If you do it outside of ORGANIZATION4,, I can put it into ORGANIZATION4,, myself. I'll have to read it,, and like process it anyway. So it's, it's just the editing,, work that, that like I have to do again. If you do it in ORGANIZATION4,, I don't have to do it myself. So do whatever is easiest for you,, to provide the content, and the sooner you give it to me the, the better. I'm aware of the fact that you are,, going to be offline and not available for the next 3 days. Okay? So let's quickly s, move on to the. So the work package 6,, is the integration, and we have discussed this, so the integration has the separate,, ORGANIZATION1 doc. That's this one. So this is something, that hopefully we will get some input from PERSON12, or you can provide some,, suggestions and question to this ORGANIZATION1 doc,, for PERSON12 to,, to look at tomorrow. So this is, There is 2 p, parts. One part is the integration with the unified platform. So that is delivering the translations,,, like the, getting the speech from, from ORGANIZATION6, and,, translating it, interpreting it at ORGANIZATION11 through our systems in the end,, and then,, shipping the subtitles,,, to ORGANIZATION6. So that's probably the unified communication platform. And there's has to be some description like when and what will be done for this,, to happen, and to be to be ready for ORGANIZATION14,, to use. This is for the online meetings, not,, for the,, live meetings. And then the integration of the minuting,, which is something we, that I'm totally not sure about because right now, we have discussed like a direct integration of the minuting backend to the to some of the ORGANIZATION1 Doc thing. And,,, maybe I'm I'm not sure,,, how much ORGANIZATION11 should be involved in this,, or not, so they now like it falls into the, the integration work package because it's some integration work. But it, it's not clear to me why would we need ORGANIZATION11. So,,, so maybe r if, if you could,, s like. When thinking about this integration task from the global point of view,, When if you could write here for PERSON12,, like w, where do you see,, ORGANIZATION11 role here, or if you don't see,, any, then ask him where does he see it. Yeah, so -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "If it is formally, it can also be that the task that we have discussed,,, a second ago here, when we were discussing task 5.5,, that the task will be,, there as we've discussed it, but not as 5.5 but rather as 6.3. And it might exclude ORGANIZATION11. So it could be within the integration work package with ORGANIZATION6 and ourselves working there, and,, put into the work package overseen by ORGANIZATION11 because it is integration activity, but we will actually just report to ORGANIZATION11, \"Yes, we're working on this.\" And ORGANIZATION11 will be not involved in that task at all. So that's that's also,, a possible,, setup. So, yeah, we need to discuss this is something that we need to discuss with,,, ORGANIZATION11 to see how much they,, want to be in that. I think that, yes, they are involved, yeah, they are involved in the transcript generation. Because we assume that we get transcripts. And we don't -",
            "Exactly, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think they are needed here.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So maybe the task 5.5, as we have discussed it, should not be 5.5 but rather 6.3. And,, it should include ORGANIZATION11 because you will ship the speech to them, and then we will get the speech from them and we will interface to something that you will find -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And modify so that it accepts,, the, the minutes.",
            "Mm-hmm, yep.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we have resolved this. So this is a yeah, tha this is. I'll I'll write it down immediately. So,:, this,, will stem from task 5.5,, that ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION13 discussed,, and task 5.5 will be,, deleted. Okay? So let's,, move on. Then,, the,, running the ORGANIZATION14 events. You are not really involved,, in this,, and,,, you. Yeah, this is the so the integration,, work package,, is the integration of,, all the technologies. And ORGANIZATION6 is here mainly to make sure that you are working on the interface to connect to ORGANIZATION11.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So the integration of the s ASR and SLT will be done once between ORGANIZATION11 and ORGANIZATION6 and then it will be used,, for the online meetings,, and for the life meetings like separately. And you will not be involved in the, in the live meetings happening. And then you are involved in the,, in the running of the event. No, you sorry, you're not involved in the running of the,, events at all. But you are involved in the dissemination part around that. So the dissemination work package is the one that I would like you to populate with as many tasks as,, you can,, find out. I like not many in number, but,, but -",
            "Clearly specified activities for those tasks. And the only one that I have so far, is,, that we could run a workshop on NLP technologies at the ORGANIZATION3 Congress, so that we will have all the representatives of those countries. And we. This is a nice place to promote, promote the technologies there. It will be in the middle of 2nd year. \"so and we are starting on the automatic,, minuting, so,, aside from the recordings of the session and its transcript, which is already available, you will also get an automatic,, summary.\" And, and then,, we can collect,, user feedback, so what would they like to have. And,, this is all the,, if, uf if we promise to this, I hope that ORGANIZATION14 will. Like ORGANIZATION14 h supposedly have seen this. So,, then,,, we will have access to the 50,,, ORGANIZATION3, the ORGANIZATION14 ORGANIZATION14 ORGANIZATION14 across LOCATION3. And this is people who have their meetings,, l every now and then with various partners. So this is a great,, great venue to talk to. So hopefully, we'll have,, this chance and it's good to, to plan it. So this is something where ORGANIZATION6,, should be active,, in the dissemination,, of,, the other work, not in, not in running the, the, the actual technologies for the, for the workshop. And for the conference. So is that clear? So for this is like a little conference,, only for ourselves, among totally like nontechnical people.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "The s the ORGANIZATION7,, activity is a different one. It's among the technical people,, who,, already like are partly interested in these technologies,, and they are like looking where to where to use this. This is for the potential users who are not aware of the fact that they could even use GoToMeeting, like ORGANIZATION14 is,, is pretty advance probably, That they use GoToMeeting.",
            "Hey Kitty, can you can you answer that question or?",
            "Yeah,, yeah, we're,, working on this work,, package.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "We will define a bit more about the task, like ORGANIZATION7 and the other things you've mentioned and we've mentioned,, already. I'm not sure about the feedback you've,, mentioned in your task.",
            "Yeah, so that's.",
            "Yeah, that's something that it's usually, th when you already have the people, it's it's good to ask them something and,, you can easily do it with ORGANIZATION1 forms. And then you gather something and you add it as an attachment to report. So I proposed a deliverable. Again, you can, you can propose any other,, thing. But I proposed to have a deliverable that would say:",
            "\"Yes, we've present it, we have this many attendees.\" And then we. In the discussion it turns out that someone like this, someone like that. And then we ask everybody to fill this, and they like came back home and we first them then and then indeed they filled out the form so we know that,, they run 3 meetings per month and they need these languages and,, the yeah they've they are very interested in or they are not at all interested in the automatic minuting. And for the automatic minuting their agendas look very different from what we see, so. I think it's it's good to ask them and to record what we get. And it's not too much w extra work tha it is some editing work, obviously, and some organization work but it's, it's, like it's worthwhile because we get input,, so I'm happy to,, to like,, s take part in this preparation,,, of that workshop and,, of the feedback,, collection as well. So I shouldn't -",
            "PERSON20?",
            "Mm-hmm?",
            "Do you want to sep participate on the workshop or is it just,, preparations?",
            "So,, for the wor well, I'll be here definitely for the, for the conference because,, that's,, t yeah, I'll be,, checking whether the MT systems run and all that. Whether I can like personally present at the workshop is something that we should leave,, for future,, decision, like depending on how many people have we have in the team and all that, but in principle yes,, but I'm afraid that I'll be also,, like. I've I know, I've organized several,, similar workshops, and when I'm organizing it's hard to find time to actually present. So if you do,, the organization or ORGANIZATION14 does the organization. And this is something that,, should be l kept flexible. So, so far, the number of person months here is very limited. So you say how many person months do you want to work on the dissemination overall, and how many person months you want to work on this particular workshop. In the preparation in the presents and also in the reporting. And,,, s based on that, well, the you or ourselves or ORGANIZATION14 will do it and,, I can contribute to that. If it's in the proposal and if you don't do the work, then well, I'll I'll have to as the coordinator, I'll have to somehow have the work done. So,, yeah, I'm I'm I hope that I'm answering your questions, so. I'm happy to contribute ideas. And but when the time,, is running out and I'm I'm totally busy then yeah, I might be silent as well. But if I promised to give a talk at the workshop, I'll be there. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it yeah, so one thing, that is, when working on these tasks,, please,, always keep in mind that the task should be put into some specific time. So for example, for the ORGANIZATION7, if we can note dates or the particular part of the year,, We can plan the task for that very occasion, which is done here for the congress. The task should be actually longer, because it should,, digest also the results from the, the congress so I'll I'll probably extend this ratio. If the task is something that's,, like totally,,, s what lasting over,, all,, we I don't know the word, so which runs all the time, such as the, publishing,, posting some tweets or, or whatever then make the task run through all the project. But it I like to h see some structure in the timing, so if the task that you come up with,, have a sensible time placement, please make use of that. If there is no sensible,, time constraining, then make them run through all the project and that's that's fine too.",
            "Okay.",
            "The one task which is kind of missing,, is the website. So the reason is that,,, I've copied the management,, work package from a project. And the,, management had this, Where I saw that? Internal website, yes. So it has internal project website and a public project website and updates. So there is no task in the management on the website, but there is a deliverable, which doesn't make much sense. So I'll move this deliverable to the dissemination and,, I'll,,, also create. Or you or I will create the task for the website. So there should be one task in the dissemination for the for the website. And the associated deliverables is the one that you have just seen. I don't know if, yeah. At least,, if nothing more, we should have like annual or,, -",
            "Yeah, annual reports on the dissemination which would these would be shorter documents, but they would just say like: \"We have attended these conferences.\" And,, the that's that's only,, to, to like justify the costs that incurred. So remember, in the budget, there is the direct costs, and you should plan,, roughly the spending for, for the travels to whatever occasions. And then, if you want to claim these, there it's nice to have a report that mentions that we were there and we presented this. Because then in the in the like spending declaration receipts there is the report and,, the report, yeah, it just fits together. So that's why the reports are good,, but they should be short. We don't want to like spent too much time writing them.",
            "Okay? So is that all clear? I th, I think that I should really stop, because it's too many the more I speak, the more,, items,,, is there on your to-do list and that's bad, so the.",
            "Yeah, I think we've we've gathered quite some tasks now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the please, I think PERSON16, you should probably focus only,, on the platform,, like w, because this is something that I'm relying on you. So you will decide how do which base which bases do we choose.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And in that case,, the demonstrator will be, well, just a web page that,, reloads and shows the, shows the minutes or,, the -",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So there is simplistic solutions,, everywa ev yeah..",
            "Yeah, so first I guess, we will do the best-case scenario.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Talk about that, talk about that tools, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Talk about the implementation and then maybe -",
            "Do the fallback.",
            "Yeah, do the fallback solutions and, yeah.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly, yeah.",
            "Yeah, and PERSON11 and PERSON21, if, if you could work on the tasks in the dissemination, that would be,, the most useful,, bit. Like to structure what you've you have already proposed many of those,, in the paragraph that you have written. So just try structure it,, so that we can populate this, this work package with a s with the structured information.",
            "Yes, alright.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, yeah, so thanks a lot. Sorry for so many items on your to-do list.",
            "But,, I'm not showing you my to-do list.",
            "I imagine.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll again send a Doodle poll for a call next week so we'll. And I most importantly, I'll send an e-mail f, to PERSON12,, to learn where we can synchronize,, on the on the integration,, work package.",
            "Alright. this.",
            "Okay, so thanks a lot, thanks a lot for, for joining and,, best luck with,, this thing of course that would be write it well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thank you too.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I'll see you soon.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Alright, bye bye.",
            "Yeah, see you. Bye bye.",

            "No, if he is available or otherwise, just leave it so we are finished from our end. That will be better, right?",
            "Uh-huh, what? Sorry, I didn't hear.",
            "So I think that let's. So let us finish from our end, first.",

            "Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Now I'm looking at the proposal.",

            "At the section,. PERSON4 is here. I just re just a moment. I will re, re. Forward her to us. I think PERSON4 is wanting to join us.",
            "PERSON4 is on the 40 minutes link.",
            "Yes.",

            "No, I didn't tell her. I put a question, if we are meeting or not.",
            "Okay. She could join, no problem.",
            "So,, so PERSON2, I will,, require your input in the following sections.",
            "In fo.",
            "In section four point three.",
            "Four point three - data description. Technical meetings, technical? Project meeting. Meetings.",
            "Okay.",
            "Go there.",
            "We can..",
            "Technical is strange. We collect our data from our technical mutual.",
            "Project meetings.",
            "Manually. So you want me to write a little bit more about that, or what is there?",
            "Maybe. A little, if you want a little bit more, and also the data statistics for, for only the PROJECT2 one. I will do for the a ORGANIZATION5 one.",
            "Aha, so the ORGANIZATION5 is not ready, yet?",
            "We will give a tentative thing.",
            "So.",
            "Like we will give a. Are ready. So I think we can.",
            "PERSON1, I'm sorry. I I kind of need that we speak about,, it a little bit slower and more structurally. I, because I'm a little bit lost in all these things. I.",
            "Okay.",
            "I guess that I miss some basic information. So now, now,, I really don't what to do. So the first thing is, my question is now is, if are we supposed to include into these four point three section, some,,, statistics data some table about our data, how large the description should be.",
            "Okay. So the thing is PERSON2 you can,, like,. If it can be four to five sentences in text. And even if it is even if the table is not available. The number of instances of the meeting and the number of hours for Emglish and Czech that is available. Would be great.",
            "Okay.",
            "And also fow how, like,, like some of the meetings are doubly annotated, right? Like for some of the meetings.",
            "There are for some of the meetings. There are more than like four, five annotations, right?",
            "So, we don't specify for how many minutes such things are done, but we say that for tasks D and C, especially for task C we have annotated. Like, we have created multiple minutes for the same meeting.",
            "And,, was it a bit clearer PERSON2?",
            "Yes. That is why I said I didn't want slides.",
            "So in which section, you are currently in, PERSON2?",
            "I am look. I am I am in in another ORGANIZATION2, I am looking for this short description. I have already done it for some VP. For some,, deliverables. So I'm just trying to find it in the ORGANIZATION2 and copy paste the data. So I have already written it once so I'm looking in the list.",
            "Okay, so PERSON2 so can I like say the other sections that I need your help, maybe?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So,, you are clear with this portion. Right PERSON2? For the data description portion, what I like, what you need to put?",
            "I'm, I'm clear with four point three.",
            "Okay, okay, wonderful. Then I require a few lines of text on the ethical,, things. So maybe a link to the ORGANIZATION6 Drive would be great. ORGANIZATION6 form, that we are collecting. The content from the participants in our project meetings.",
            "To release the data. And since the ORGANIZATION5 data is already available in the public domain. So there is no a point of picking content.",
            "That what's released to the public domain. What did you say?",
            "The the ORGANIZATION5 data is already available in the public domain.",
            "Uh-huh. That ORGANIZATION5,.",
            "Yes.",
            "So,, there is no point of asking content right? Which is already available. So anyone can see and view.",
            "And,, the third thing that I would request from you is the manual metric. So I'm not sure which three, four criteria we should include here.",
            "Uh-huh okay. May,, yes. Okay. I will look at it. Probably now.",
            "And will write something and proba. Till what time are you available? Maybe we could speak once more. For shor. Shortly after I create the input, and you will look through that, and we could discuss on. If you need to add something. So I understand that I should,, enter some information into four sections, including my own,, biography sentences.",
            "Yes,.",
            "And then then you look at it.",
            "Yes, yes, okay.",
            "Probably I will start now, yes. Or do you want to any.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Do you want any?",
            "And the other. Yeah, the other thing PERSON2 I wanted to discuss with you is actually section four point ten. So here I am a bit struggling that.",
            "Four point then.",
            "I - Why? Why a special session is required for this task?",
            "What is a special session?",
            "So, the question.",
            "What is special session?",
            "So this particular shared task is going to be a part of the PROJECT1 special session. Okay, so whatever,, challenges of the shared task that are currently in in the speech, they are in the special session, not as part of the main conference.",
            "Oh, I don't understand at all. So what is special session of what? T, okay, let me share you the link.",
            "So there is some PROJECT1 conference. And our shared task is in the whole sh PROJECT1 conference, but within a special section.",
            "Like,, the challenges are they usually held in special session. Which are run parallel with the main conference.",
            "Why,, we are in in a special section. Do you know that? So I don't understand at all. What does it does not mean to be in a special section.",
            "So okay, let me to you. Do you know that in a conference, there are parallel workshops as well as a main conference, right?",
            "Yes. And I suppose that the official section.",
            "So what?",
            "Because we were not accepted to the general session, isn't it?",
            "No, the general session would not allow for you to float your own task. That is a general conference,",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "We would bring our own task in parallel with PROJECT1. So PROJECT1 won't allow like. For example, for example, why do we do workshops, because in in the conferences. The reason being, we want to focus on a very particular thing. Not in the overall conference, right?",
            "So this is the reason that why we go for workshops or special sessions. So you can check in this link.",
            "So all the challenges and the shared tasks in PROJECT1, are held in as part of the special sessions.",
            "Okay, so why should we? In this case, why should we answer this question? It is just clear, because we have shared task and all share tasks here are in special session.",
            "Okay. Yes, yes.",
            "So that is the question that they are.",
            "I don't understand it.",
            "Asking as part of their submission. Yeah. Like. The question is.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know. PERSON1 I know. I think we could say maybe. So. It will be very rude now. But the idea is that making a summarizations of project meetings and making minutes automatically. And automatic minutes of,, project meetings is a very, very, very, extremely hard task, not realisable. And we actually don't really believe that it is realisable,, and nobody can do that in at least a little bit appropriate way. That's why we don't know how to do it. And that's why we want to organize a shared task, as probably some will -. Somebody can try. So we organised shared us because we don't know how to do it ourselves. This is the reality.",
            "Yeah, this is the reality. I totally agree, but this has to like sugar coat it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But probably we can say something like that. This is extremely hard task. That is that no. That is. That I do not know. Today's level of,, technical possibilities not reached yet. So our first try is to open it with, with a shared task. We cannot open it resi in a normal session, because normal session supposes that some people already have some results and compare these results. And we ju want to give a try. So we are, we are not comparing the resu. We don't have results yet, but we want to give this task a try.",
            "Um-hum,? Yes,, because,, this question. And another question that,, that is there at the beginning. Like,, why is this special.",
            "I'm really unable to answer this, these questions, and it is really awkward.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's not my field. Sorry.",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm very direct. This is the only possibility though.",
            "So, but like, I have to include five points on why this session is special. And then, why a special session is required in spite of the main conference. So that we have to clearly explain. Fighting on, which can also help us here a bit.",
            "Yeah. But this, I do not think that my idea is bad. So why not to say.",
            "Your.",
            "It is so hard, that we cannot demand ready long papers, just not ready from long papers. So the task is so hard that,, first, to people should give it a try. And that is why we give more than one task, we gave these three tasks? So that we let people approach it from different sides. I don't know blah blah blah. But, so,,, really use this? This, compli,. This,, hardness of the task but, still that it has, sense, because,, it will help i don't know what. So, I, I, really, kind, of, believe, that, it, this task, has sense and I even believe that, it may be sometimes have some results. But not at today's level of I don't know what, the neural science. So let's give it a try. Why not? Well. Maybe, maybe I am not a good person to ask about it. PERSON3 will be definitely better. He's all.",
            "I got an. I got an important point from you.",
            "What?",
            "I got an, I got an important point from you to write. So, so, the point is that,, the task is hard so our attempt is to lower down the entry barrier towards this task so that it can get popularised in the community.",
            "Probably, yes. Yes. I don't. I didn't understand all the words you say, but I think the idea was the same.",
            "Yes, so, we want to make it is simple.",
            "Yes.",
            "So we want to lower down the entry barrier.",
            "Yes. Yes, you want to make it closer to people. So if you are just. If we put it as a normal call in, as a conference session. Nobody will kind of apply, because nobody does it yet. And this is our to to. Kind kind of get closer to programmers. So when you. So when I now address the Russian colleagues,, if I address them,, With the proposition to write a long paper to the conference session about summarization of meeting, nobody would apply. Because nobody still does a summarization of su, me, meet minutes of meetings. But if I. If we form a share task, trying to summarise whatever, dialog texts, a min, minutes. So people may say, okay, I have worked with dialog texts, and I may also try things. Why not try, why not to try making some minutes. If I already did something like dialogue summarizations. So that's why the shared task is kind of really approaching so we ha. So I have got three Russian colleagues, just, for two days. Because. And these are not people who are do, who are doing minutes for meetings. So this is like. It has very strong reasons to make this special sessions. So if, if you. If this was the question, I'm not sure.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I think some. I think,, that was like really helpful. I will input this.",
            "Okay, perfect. Thank you. I'm not sure if I understood the question correctly, but if you got something for that I'm happy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I think I got something to write. And then PERSON3 can work on that.",
            "Yeah. Okay. This, this. By the way, this understanding each other feature is very, very, very interesting linguistic item tools.",
            "And it is also important for the status of the project, you know.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, anyway. So these are the things that I request PERSON2. And yeah,, and PERSON4 are you there in the link.",
            "Yeah, yeah I'm there. I am listening to both of you.",
            "No, I'm asking, are you there in the ORGANIZATION2 link. I can't see you.",
            "Oh, which overleaf link, where is the ORGANIZATION2 link? I don't know.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Just send her again. Maybe it. In ORGANIZATION4 you have to send it again. Because if she. If PERSON4 haven't been there, she can't see it.",
            "Yeah. No, I can't see.",
            "What can I want? I would need your bio here.",
            "Yeah, they will attach it. So I cannot. I am logged in with my phone, and I cannot open it.",
            "So.",
            "Okay, no issues. So I will send it over chat maybe?",
            "Yeah, maybe.",
            "Can we create another linqua chat? Is it possible?",
            "Yes, of course. Why not?",
            "Like a group chat. How, how, how do we make it?",
            "Just this little chat. I don't know how to do that. PERSON5 did that.",
            "No, I just go to,,, -",
            "Conversation. View. Aha. I have new. I can make conversation.",
            "Connect, yeah.",
            "Speak to your. Aha.",
            "New conversation. And.",
            "No. It's something different. No, it's not. Something different.",
            "How can we add participants?",
            "I do not know, I never did it. New conversation is something different. It's. Aha. Maybe. No, it's different. New conversation isn't. It is not creating group. It is creating just dialogue.",
            "But he can send in the group of, I think.",
            "Yeah, we can send. I thought, like the group to create another,, like chat. Like the way one we have we hang out for this. For quick communication amongst us. Anyway. Yeah. Well, PERSON1 I will just start working on these four points, before I have to go. So that I manage to do it today.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, like.",
            "Do we have other issues?",
            "No.",
            "So, I'm still.",
            "Well, so I'm going to this overleaf and starting to write something.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. So.",
            "Okay.",
            "I leave to ORGANIZATION2. Bye, bye.",
            "Okay.",
            "Another thing. PERSON2, like,, if you have some,, like points to in, like, put in the introduction and. Background that would also be great.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like if you want. I'm like, anyway, I'm writing. So, if you want I can also.",
            "Okay, I will. I will look for that. But i am very very bad at all this formal advertisement and kind of kind of,, speaking things. I really, really. I have never did anything like that and I have kind of anti. Kind of. How to say that. Frustration about creating such popular thing. I'm,, well.",
            "Okay. Don't worry.",
            "I will try to write some ads but,, psychologically, I am very bad at addressing group of people, groups of people. So I am I am good in the individual communication. But in this group communication,,, I will try to, but. I'm. Don't expect great results.",
            "Don't worry. Absolutely don't worry,, like three, see two sections four point three and four point four.",
            "And yes, it takes four point three - manual metrics and biography.",
            "Yes, that would be enough.",
            "Okay. And then we will go for the rest. Ok, well, bye, bye. I'm trying to do. I will try to do something.",
            "Okay, okay, bye, bye. So, PERSON4 are you there in the link?",
            "Yes. I did you send it on the chat?",
            "Yes.",
            "ORGANIZATION4 chat?",
            "Yes.",
            "Oh. Can you, please, send it on the ORGANIZATION4 chat? I cannot see the link. Did you send it?",
            "Yes I did.",
            "In the ORGANIZATION4 chat?",
            "Yes, yes, I did.",
            "So from me, you need only bio, right?.",
            "Yeah. And if you have some inputs. That would be great.",
            "Actually, my WiFi is not working right now.",
            "Okay, no issues.",
            "Okay, I will check it and I will revert to you.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay, maybe we can talk about it in the chat?",
            "Yes, yes, sure, sure.",

            "So PERSON3 has a presentation right? PERSON3 can you see it?",
            "Yes, PERSON3 presentation?",
            "Yes and we didnt include the video.",
            "Yeah, because we do not have any. There was nothing to, to include and the moment. The one, which would be most for one would be the video.",
            "Sir, there is a 90 seconds space, what do we do?",
            "90 seconds, that is good. 90 is quite a lot. And can you edit it somehow?.",
            "Yes, we can. We can append to the end, and and they will, they will, they will paste it together for need to paste the videos.",
            "Okay. Thats is good. So can can I see the the presentation, the recording is it available anywhere or, or not?",
            "Yes, I can send your the link and confine it among the uploaded videos.",
            "So that there are other presentations, also available right for by other teams?",
            "No only by me. And i worry that you need to play the two videos separately, because there is one video of me talking, and the other is the recorded screen.",
            "I see.",
            "And they are in webm format, if you download them.",
            "So hopefully will play for me, i think, I have seen some webm, webm files, so thats very good. Ok. So. So you know, there is there is a rage. They not results of flicker. PERSON5 youre again,. Or maybe its not PERSON5, maybe someone else's is look at me.",
            "Its me, because my laptop is stuck in this moment. I borrowed.",
            "Okay, yeah thats good. Yeah. Thank you. So I will have a look at the presentation. The deadline is tomorrow, right? Tomorrow anywhere on Earth, or are those any, any specification of the time zone?",
            "No. Maybe tomorrow, tomorrow, AOAA, AOI.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So I'm now looking at the evaluation, the this link, the scores and im still curious like confused, its video name. So maybour so is the one that we were subtitling. And how do we know. Okay so we do know the reference for the English maybour. Okay. So this is, this is what we can present. But then I'm really surprised to see the is like points to into one and two point 19 and thirteen, or fourteen into, into German. Why is it Is it correct? It is in this, this big,, like it is the check that bad, or is it an issue with the segmentatio? In general, the checks course, look look strange. Also very very bad like.",
            "Yeah,",
            "Yeah so.",
            "I would like to point here ASR.",
            "Yes, exactly this only translation, and also need the world error rates.",
            "So here is the the demo. I'm opening the demo document now, and I'm searching for that Mabel, Mabel.",
            "The demo document in the in the scrolled.",
            "Okay, okay. Yup, yeah, okay. So the rate for English ASR, shefers is terrible order rate. Ok. That would explain why the are so bad, the are not so bad. And, so this is,, this is what we can report, for the check. And this is what we can report for the marble English speech, and actually which of the systems have we used for the demo as well.",
            "I don't know wha that domain has.",
            "Yeah. So. And so there we would need to look at the the file. So please,,,, PERSON5, please provide to the ASR outputs as well, as the references. And same for the bless course here. So in the ORGANIZATION1 sheets and I'm adding two lines among, and would like to know the base directory. So if you could paste here. But I do not know, where the source is. And then.",
            "Lots of noise, if. PERSON3 are you using headphones or not.",
            "Yes, you can see.",
            "It is strange that is that its making so much noise.",
            "Yes its quite, quite. So I can paste.",
            "The translation into czech was like I would not say that this was so, it was so bad that it would deserve, it would deserve such a low score. And also in the German. German one were used for the translation for the demo itself.",
            "Come again sorry, i didnt hear.",
            "Which So we have now, for example for the German two versions, which one was used. It was system like this one.",
            "So for today, we are used ASR system.",
            "And the empty is the same in all cases right?",
            "Yeah theyre.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this missing cell, this cell C5. Is it also the ASR, and then empty output so should it be the same as, as C7?",
            "Yes.",
            "I'll have a look at the and and the files and for the czech, this one was also used. So here in vaguely seems that system work worse, but I do not trust these numbers. So we we should double check.",
            "Actually I should double check the domain adaptation, maybe that could be the reason.",
            "Yes, but youre talking about ASR scores, and not the bless scores in in this bullshit. You are talking about the the world error rates in the table from last surgical from the 90.",
            "Yeah yeah so basically I used the sync to get to get distance script.",
            "OK still, I Do not think that there is so far any like a new information that so the the general, this is what was used for the demo right? So we can safely use these numbers in the presentation. And for the czech we used the general one. And not the adapted one. Right?",
            "Yes we used he general one.",
            "This morning. No. I'm talking about the czech the czech ASR because we also further.",
            "And so that was the the the general oneone. So there could be some little.",
            "Ok. So that is for this. And that there is only numbers, which should make it into the demo presentation. And there is no change in the plans like choice of a different video does not really goes like coming to a question at all. I think this is. This is perfect. So that is the the minor than things like fixing the the the. I did not know what the you go to it or.",
            "And what is important is that you run a test the with the video and the video acually finishes."

            "Oh, it's,, interesting -. It's a strange situation,, actually ORGANIZATION4 is pretty lucky as a company, because our work,, can continue even if we work from home. In fact.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Commercial activities it's really,, a difficult moment I have to say. But,, don't worry. We are all fine. No, no one of ORGANIZATION4 is sick, we are all fine, really.",
            "Yeah, that's good.",
            "That's good yeah.",
            "Well we can continue our work from home. It's not that comfortable.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So, that's that's -. I am, I am very happy to hear that you are not affected personally. Because,, what the news say about LOCATION1 it's it's terrifying. Like it's, it's really crazy.",
            "Yep.",
            "People queuing -.",
            "But,, that's a problem with the medias so, so be careful -. Of course it's asked for us to stay at home.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In order to avoid,, sanitary problem,.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Probably as you wrote, wrote us in your in your email the,,, the amount of people sick will increase in the next two weeks I think still. And this is really -. It's it's terrible actually. But don't worry really. We are Italian. We are able to take also bad things with irony.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the last resort. We we do it as well -. But it's. Yeah.",
            "It's it's peculiar actually,, it,, we start singing from the balconies of our homes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "All people are on their balconies and sing along Surro.",
            "I've seen a lot of videos of that.",
            "This is really really an Italian thing.",
            "Yeah. So the problem is, that here not everybody has a balcony and,, we are now. We are now stranded as home, at home as well. Like we can only. We're allowed to go to work and then back and that's it. So we have the quarantine for everybody. The whole Czech Republic is in quarantine, like every hou household, every, everyone. For 10 days at least,, something like that. So, we'll see. Yeah. But I think it's it's important to do it. Because I don't want the situation to escalate as far as as it's got in LOCATION1. So, as as you said -. We are in lucky field of,, work. Because we can do ev everything except that I have my kids around here and they tend to disturb me often, so -. I am at home and I have to take care of them. So we are like doing all the work that schools normally do. So they are giving us their home works. But it's not only the home works. It's also that you have to read with them. So simply like basic schooling.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yeah, okay. So it seems that we have now everybody. Except ORGANIZATION5 and I guess I have confused them,, by,, sending an email this morning that as a last resort we, we would consider ORGANIZATION5. So they are probably waiting for us in the. But also PERSON4 said that they are, they are under pressure, because they have too many requests for the ORGANIZATION5 platform, which is common. So there is areas of business where,, this is useful, so. Is helped.",
            "Me some document?",
            "You are here. Oh, great. Okay. You made it. Excellent PERSON4, hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Yeah, we have ORGANIZATION5,, we still don't have PERSON11, but I'm not sure if he would be connecting. PERSON11. Yeah, yeah. So I don't know whether whether PERSON11 is here but never mind. We have PERSON1 from,, ORGANIZATION13, we have PERSON1 and PERSON6 from ORGANIZATION1,, and,,, and there is us, so, so that's it. Thanks,,, to everybody. It's great that you were able to join, actually,, remote meetings are now more common,, and yeah. More popular than regular meetings these days, so let's let's take one. As always, we are recording this. We have unfortunately lost the ORGANIZATION5 recordings,, because they have to be downloaded within 30 days and we were too busy with other things that nobody took care of that and the automatic downloader was not yet set-up. So, I don't want to name the persons who has done it, it was not me. But.",
            "I hear someone. It's probably PERSON4. So PERSON4 if you can mute yourself when you are not talking then it would be,, then it would be good. Yeah, okay. So if you are all on the,, call on the remote call today. So then there is financial table something,, which is something that PERSON18 will probably present, right? And then I will talk ab briefly talk about IWSLT preparations and maybe joint submission and otherwise there is not much in the,, in the plan for the call. Because,, the very next deliv deliverables are at the end of June but they would probably be happening earlier, so at the end of May, so that's what we should thing and that's still quite far away from now. But still everybody remind themselves of of that. And,, we are still heavily preparing for the ORGANIZATION6 workshop,, ORGANIZATION6 congress and the workshop associated with that,, but whether this will take place or not it's totally undecided. As I wrote in the email, I can't imagine that the ORGANIZATION8s will say that they are something better than regular citizens and they will not obey,, the,,, the regulations. I think they have the, they have the right to do so, but at the same time they are definitely not going to risk anything. So,, I expect that they will in some form run the congress and they will probably switch to remote one. If we had PERSON11 on the call, then he might be able to tell us. If he knows. But he probably also doesn't know. Okay, so now I will mute myself and, and PERSON18 will,,, present the financial table.",
            "Yeah, okay. Well, hi everyone. The financial table,, it's something what I will send to,, to you all. And will need to to, to for you to fill it before the financial, before the review which will we have in a in June. It's nothing scary, it's just,, it's just two sheets. But,, the division is quite nice. So,, please fill in who will be your responsible person for this, because I don't want to bother everyone with it. So just ORGANIZATION5 is now missing the person and,, I will probably solve this directly with the responsible person, because yeah the other usually don't know about these things. So, it's actually PERSON16 very short.",
            "Yeah. It's it's kind of preparation for the review meeting, right?",
            "Yes, well it's also the preparation for the financial report we will have to submit by the end of August I think.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this just to. Also for you just to summarise whether is everything alright, and if you need to do some changes so it would fit nicely. So it's like.",
            "Yeah. It's like a head up, a hea, a heads up that there will be this table needed. And it will be needed in some preliminary form for the review,, and the final form after the end of the period. Which is after June,, due end of August. So this,, is this is like our first,, synchronisation on this. So that we are sure that,, you know what numbers to to look up and and how to organise them for us.",
            "Yes, they also want to have them their specified so it's good like. It's overview of everything what you should have been tracking so it's like. It's very, yeah.",
            "So if you forgot to track something then you still have couple of months.",
            "Yes.",
            "To, to recover from that. So this is like a dry rung. And there will be preliminary but already official information to the reviewers before the meeting. And then the final which,, will be submitted through the system. But, but it will be in the same form,, the same type of numbers.",
            "Yes. So PERSON4 PERSON19, whom who should I send from ORGANIZATION5?",
            "Am to me. Can you hear me?",
            "Okay. Yeah? Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay. That's all for the financial table, basically.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay,. Yeah. So we have, we have everything. So now the IWSLT preparations,, yeah, so,, okay, thanks for the answer. We are preparing the test set for the for the shared task on the non-native, non native speaker, non-native spoke language translation. We have to release the test sets,, tomorrow. That is the source side of the test set, the English audio. So, we will release it as as this 16Khz wav files. If that is the format which we have, from the from the,, if for some of the data sets we have only the Mp3s but we we'll try to do the wav files. And,.",
            "But, sorry PERSON16, this is just our suggestion. Maybe,, it's better to ask also to the ASR people.",
            "Yeah, so maybe if PERSON1 but I don't know if PERSON1 has some long term experience like what what what would people. Wh wh whether PERSON1 has some numbers. Whether Mp3s are worse then wav files.",
            "No, the Mp3 is okay.",
            "So Mp3 is even okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, so we will, we will probably release,, both,,, allowing people to use everything. But in the long term I am happy to switch to Mp3s because,, these files are smaller and you can version them. So they fit in Git in GitHub repositories,, so that's. That's why I prefer them.",
            "Sorry PERSON16.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Look at the F-L-A-C,, format, which is also a compression but it's not.",
            "It's not sorry. It's not what? It's not?",
            "It's so ac accumpressed file but it's not and usually it's better than the Mp3. FLAC the FLAC one. Okay.",
            "The FLAC one. Okay, thank you. So will check. Will check this. Okay, thank you. And we are also working obviously on the target sides. Both, the transcriptions and the,, and the translations. Everything of this should be, be ready,, well some of the files,,, the very small, a very small number of files are to arrive only on the 30th of of March. Of the translations from the agency, this submission date deadline is the end of March,, and then we have some time to evaluate it. So it's like we're we're, we're on track,, but not not so comfortably as we wanted to be. And the main reason,, is that it tooks it took months until the ORGANIZATION8 actually decided that we can use some of the recordings so,, that's we are, we are so late with translating them. But we have some. So if, if it. If the full set works well,, works out well then we'll have, where is that, about an hour to. About two hours of our domain,, of English sound and translations in for German and, and Czech. And then we'll have actually any number of if you like of Khan Academy vi videos and also an half an hour I think it's half an hour. Something between half an hour and an hour of Antrecorp as the test set. So that's what will be released,, tomorrow. So I am getting towards the joint submission. This is something that PERSON12 is overseeing. And PERSON13 will run it. So all of you,,, your systems are going to be put to use. PERSON12 has sent the leader board, first leader board table on some other test sets. So we will move to like similar type of evaluation on the IWSL desk IWSLT dev set. Which is very small because we failed to deliver it in in larger,, volume in in time,, and will be choosing which syms, choosing system to chose,,, which system to use in the end. And then we'll,, we'll do the submission. So this is going to happen even if you like didn't do anything special. But obviously we, we would be happy if you did something special about this. So if you had the time, please speak to PERSON12 and synchronise with him, like at what time we should run which workers. And the most important thing, this has to be documented then in the system paper for for that. So please take notes what is being used and what is, what is under the hoot.",
            "And I just assume that PERSON12 will just let us know when these tests are running so we we know which workers we've got running?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is.",
            "Good.",
            "Yeah. And maybe actually, do do the workers have like the version signature? Is anything recorded in the log files?",
            "I don't think so. No, no it isn't.",
            "No, no, no, I don't think so. So one way we could do this is just to use, different finger prints I guess or.",
            "Or alternative systems,, I don't know how easy it is to deal with the multiple pipelines that make use of different systems. So for example I have one English to Czech system, that is currently running,, which uses the ORGANIZATION3 fingerprint. But I've got another model, which I think will probably perform better.",
            "So I could, I could just set up another worker with a slightly different finger print and let you know where that is and then I can keep it running. And then we don't have to synchronise about time, so we would have separate logs.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Would that, would that work?",
            "So maybe that is. Yeah. Maybe that is indeed the safest. But,,, if it's, if it concerns the translation system it's jut one final finger print. If it concerns the ASR system, then it,, it makes it trickier, because you coul, you would have to multiply,, the finger prints. Finger prints have to -. Essentially the last finger print has to identify the full path.",
            "So, so.",
            "And you have,, and you have ASR times ORGANIZATION2 paths.",
            "So I suppose what we have been I guess that we don't have that. But if each component could put some kind of version number into the message as it is passed along?",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "But that's not.",
            "But that adds. But that is one more variable in mediator. But in fact and ORGANIZATION2 for all the workers and this is. The information can be about the version and we we can download it from admined web then.",
            "Okay, okay. That's that's easy to to change from my end.",
            "So please please please synchronise on this. And please, and like PERSON12 please,, supervise the creation of of this. Actually as soon as we release the test sets, let's do,, final run,, like a complete run, end to end run of everything. Because that will, it will break in first three attempts I am sure. And the versions will be wrong in the in the first three attempts and so on. So, please consider Wednesday the day where everything should be run for the first time. And then we will have every, every other day,, some new update,, and so on. So,,, PERSON12 and PERSON13 should today and tomorrow get ready for,, for this run and you should try to add the version numbers to this information that is passed through the mediator. And PERSON12 and PERSON13 need to be sure that it is recorded in the loggers. And then on Wednesday, when the test sets are out,, we need to run it,, and have the first loggers. And them in the subsequent days we should, we should do the better versions.",
            "Okay and.",
            "Yeah, are we going to have different versions? Are you going to update the ORGANIZATION2 workers and the scripts?",
            "So PERSON1 just said that. So PERSON1 just said he has one version and,, I think it's worth trying out more. Like, why not? If it's, if if they are trained. And also remember that there is some overlap between,,, the available German versions and available Czech translations. And there is possibly some choice of the ASR system. So there is quite a few combinations that we should try out and,, then chose one of them based on well. Not the perfect dev set but on some dev set,, to to submit to submit it. But I think it's,. Actually I would suggest that we submit more versions because IWSLT in my track,, does the same policy as WMT. So we can submit as many non-primary submission as we like. And and one needs to be marked as as primary and and that's it. So the more we have the better. The more we learn about the evaluation. Yeah, okay. So that is that is like the joint submission. Here the remarks are that PERSON12,, plus PERSON13 get ready today plus tomorrow first full run on Wednesday,,, then, improved version loggders need to record,, detailed versions of each component. Okay. And then, the other the other question is other IWSLT submissions. So, I have a student who is working on English ASR and,,, he is,, hopefully he will be able to try, he is working on that,, to try out another set up of English Czech. So he is not targeting German and that will be like an independent submission. So I was just curious if any other side is also trying that or if you have,, like other colleagues in other departments who you could ask to take part. Because as PROJECT1 we would like to know what is the best solution on the market. On the research market I mean. So,, the,, the more teams we get in the better we will know who performs best on the domain of the ORGANIZATION8s because that's substantial part of our test set. So, please ask around. I have asked,, well sent an email but they didn't responded it at ORGANIZATION9. I have asked at ORGANIZATION12 and then I've asked two Czech teams who do ASR. So far. That was before the,, the the Corona virus got so bad. So far they didn't answer. I'll notify them that the test sets are out and hopefully they will do something. So if you have other teams that you could contact -. And it would be only like run it,, run it exercise for them, please do so. So that's, that's like foreign IWSLT submissions. And is anyone planning,, their own submission? So, so nothing from ORGANIZATION1. No? I've seen some registration of ORGANIZATION13 in the overall IWSLT task. But I don't know whether it was also for this task or not. Or whether it has managed to cover the joint submission or whether there is another submission,, by ORGANIZATION13. So PERSON1 do you know more?",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so,, and I don't think we will submit something for this task. But for other and also I used to involved in IWSLT but this year I I I just support peoples. I'd like to do that so.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that's. So there is nothing,, yeah. So only, only us, yeah. No ORGANIZATION13 no ORGANIZATION1 but still please ask around,, outside outside of PROJECT1,, yeah. Okay. Well,. Thats seems like the end of the agenda. Which is great. Do we have any other things to discuss? I think we'll be in touch at the end of the month because then there will be probably news. Like the conference for example is deciding whether to run on when to run. Towards the end of March. And I guess the similar update will be on ORGANIZATION6.",
            "So you still think that the ORGANIZATION6 still may go ahead?",
            "I think it may go ahead, yes. I am not sure.",
            "Oh, okay, but I as a physical conference? Yeah, but even if it does, we will not be travelling to it.",
            "Is that fair?",
            "Yes, that's. So like. It it was never a, never a requirement that you would travel.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.",
            "So,, it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So if you if you are already certain that you would not travel, that's. It's good to tell us right away. So that so we know that.",
            "It would be. If it actually does take place, then it will be good to have someone from ORGANIZATION4 around. That would be most important. But even if it, if Italians still cannot come to the Czech Republic, now now nobody can travel at all.",
            "We plan to join you for ORGANIZATION6 congress of course. But you know that at the moment the the situation it's not that clear.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So that's. Yeah i just don't know. The end of May is still quite some time ahead. Well the problem is that the Germany is going very bad, LOCATION1 is hopefully near the peak with Germany the peak will arrive in two weeks at if not later. And the UK is also going to explode because -. I'm I'm sure, because -.",
            "Yeah,, I'm will predict that the peak is early summer.",
            "Early summer you'd say? Oh.",
            "That's what they're saying yep. But it's changing every day so we don't really know. To be honest.",
            "Oh, so early summer it's like early July, right? Or June.",
            "I'd say. Well that's another question. I don't know when that is. I'd say more or less it's May or June is early summer.",
            "May or June.",
            "To me, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah. Beginning of June. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I, my, my my.",
            "He says many things.",
            "He says many. And another thing was that,, everybody has to die one day anyway. So it's like -. The way. The way your Prime Minister says it is not too, not too optimistic.",
            "Yeah, he doesn't inspire optimism. Yeah.",
            "Okay. So, so then. Well if the congress does not take place,, at all. Or if it does not take pla, if it does not take place physically, then it puts the most burden on us I'd think actually. Because,, we'd still try to do all the, all the translation but it would be much more difficult conditions in terms of all the interpreters at various places like. It's. The interpreters also has their technologies for remote interpreting. But we would need to be able to attach to those channels and and all that. So it will be like a new set-up.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Getting ready for very new set ups.",
            "Then there is. Then there would be more pressure on them to make sure that things like microphones and network all wall all works correctly.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the,.",
            "Which is what we need.",
            "So the focus the focus will have to change quickly,, so far we are focusing on the on the like getting the input from the physical pipeline and and then the the normal and then the normal networks. And now it would be the acquisition of sound would be also complicated by network traffic.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this, this is the the hard part,, and if,,, it is cancelled altogether then we will have more time to focus on the deliverables. So,, please,, do not leave the deliverables,, for May. Start working on the deliverables,, already now, or,, or in April. The list of deliverables is already. If you scroll down in the in the document PROJECT1 Remote Meetings. This is what we discussed in the last call,, so the publishing platform that has been delivered. Then we have report 1 on initial ASR system, report 1 on spoke language translation, initial report on summarisation,, and then the report on NLP technologies at the ORGANIZATION6 congress,, and report on dissemination,, and project management,,, guide and update of that. So there is a lot lot of texts to write. So especially for the technical deliverables I think you can start with writing right away. If you have papers, these,, that's the best thing,, if you have,,, papers -. All of these reports are public -. So it's not good to put there anything which is under review yet. It's it's if if you have material,, that is not written up as a paper, I would put it there, because it like doesn't steal the the publication opportunity as it's the that I would say so.",
            "If it's already organised into a paper but not reviewed yet, then I would not include it. And if it is published, then it's ideal because then you can include it directly.",
            "But, but that creates bit of a problem. You said written up to. I mean if it's written up to a paper, we should not include that. Say for example it was submitted to which crosses this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "This, this, this deadline.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But yeah that that creates a bit of a problem. It's like either we don't put it in and then the deliverable is extremely thin or we just don't submit. Or we will have to wait, wait.",
            "No, no, no, no.",
            "Wait, wait for months after the deliverable is published in order to submit. So can't we just push the publication of the deliverable out a bit? I mean it's poss.",
            "Oh, it's totally po. I see, okay.",
            "Yeah, I mean. I mean it's supposed to be public but doesn't have to go out immediately. That.",
            "That's a good idea. So that's probably something that we should,, ask. Well, there is I think there is a risk that the Commission publishes the deliverable. In their databases righ away.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think that it could be negotiated. So.",
            "That's also a point, yes. But,, I mean. It it it it's a theoretical question at the moment but it it could become a practical question and the we need -.",
            "I think. I like your proposal. I think it is the best way to to it, to,, to have it delivered to the Commission on time. Including the draft version of the paper as it was submitted as is under review and then publish it,,, like later on. So it's it's yeah -",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's probably the best option. If the paper on archive,, including your names,, then again you can put it there right away.",
            "Then it's fine to include it, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, it's just.",
            "If you, if you, yeah. So PERSON18, please talk to PERSON8 and ask him when the deliverables are published on the web. And if there is any way to de to delay that, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't. PERSON18 is there, okay. Yeah, so,, so then that would be ideal. We would put everything what is already in the form of paper into the deliverables,, and,, we would just ask for a later publication. I think I think that's a reasonable thing to ask for.",
            "And it's no good the I mean the EMNPL verification? Or it's jut? I can't remember but it's not it's not going to be delayed any longer than that.",
            "Yes, and also for PROJECT2 there is probably ORGANIZATION7,, anonymity period. So if you put the paper on the archive early enough,, -",
            "Yeah, then. Then it's fine.",
            "Then you can include it as as an archive paper. And have it then under the review for PROJECT2.",
            "Yeah, so. Then there should be quite a small amount of content that's gonna be affected.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway, please start working on these soon. I think that we will, we will probably make the initial step and we will prepare the overleaf links for for each of these. So that's something -. So PERSON18, please make sure and distribute, that we create and distribute these overleaf links,, and,, sh,, everybody can start with writing. Right, okay? So that's that and add one bit here, and that's the upcoming deliverables and I think. Yeah. Deliverables plan., include papers. Ask PERSON2 for a later publication of the deliverable. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. That's everything from me. If you don't have any further questions then enjoy your quarantines. And we'll we'll have another call in approximately a month,, from now,, because by that time we'll have like the final decisions on all that many events. When. Whether they take place and in what form. Yeah. Okay. So thanks and take care. Thank you. Bye Bye.",
            "Thank you. Bye bye.",
            "Thank you. Bye bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Bye, bye. Hi PERSON18. Bye. Okay.",
            "Yeah. Hi PERSON16, so I'm here.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great, yep.",
            "Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you. So,, first of all how are you doing? Have you understood the the regulation that now applies to you?",
            "Yeah, I think so. I understand that I do not need to go outside except for work or buying groceries or medicines.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "And no one necessarily walking outside.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I was working on the karaoke and I didn't understand what exactly needs to be done here. So I have,, written here few,, a few of my doubts.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, I'll start with the first of them. So, okay, okay, okay. So,, I need to understand like what exactly,, the forced aligner does. So in the forced alignment review that input as adjacent file which has multiple adjacent objects during the duration of the audio path you know. That's the test segment.",
            "Yeah, that is, that is just like a file list. So the adjacent is essentially just a file list which tells tells you what all files should be processed. And it paralyses them as it as it likes. And,, for each of them you provide the text and it it will emit the words aligned to some positions in the time. So this is only like a batch procession of of a a large number of files.",
            "Okay. So,,, am, so as far as I know the forced aligner it also does ASRs. So are we deliberating the ASR in any way?",
            "Oh,, well in internally it uses ASR because it searches. It tries to process the input and then it finds in in the full of candidates where the words that we require are located. So we we don't make the use of this ASR ourselves. It is being used by the forced aligner. And that's it. So we only want to see the time stamps.",
            "I I am not sure if I understand that. Like,, what does,, the how does the forced alignment uses the ASR?",
            "It it processes the input sound. It creates like a lettuce like a set of candidates and then in this set of. So the good thing about this set of candidates is that it knows where the words were found. But it doesn't know which words are the correct ones.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And,, by itself. So if it's only the normal ASR it will then emit the most likely candidates from this set. But in the forced set up you are telling it pick this word pick this word pick this word and so on. So you are choosing path in the lettuce but the lettuce is all time stamped. And when you chose the path, you will know the time stamps at which these words occurred in the, in the, in the, in the speech. So that's exactly how you obtain the alignments.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. So basically the times, the time stamps after each word that is done by the forced aligner. And yeah, okay, I start to get some sense out of it.",
            "It's as if if a human was doing, if a human was doing it. You would you would be like listening. If it was like a very slow pace, you would be writing down a time when you heard the word and as a human you would already get the single best path. You would understand it perfectly. So then you would only like copy form your time stamped record the times to the, to the expected output.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay, I get it.",
            "Yeah, so what it, what it. The the karaoke. The reason why we want to do this karaoke is that we want quick visual inspection of this word,, word aligned, or word time stamped transcripts. So imagine -. This is what I was just doing,, for the IWSLT test set anonymisation. I was doing only the text part, so I was,, like reading the transcript and whenever I saw like one of the names of the participants of the meeting I replaced that name with censored, with with some key word only. And now the next step is for PERSON14 and he needs to find the appropriate position in in the recording and do the of that.",
            "I get it, yeah.",
            "And so if if he would be able to like scroll the movie which highlights the words then he would scroll the movie to the point where it shows censored and he would listen whether it's the right position. And I also kind of needed this facility. It is essentially,, like a full text search within audio. So,, I also needed this because when reading the transcripts, I realised there were some errors. Like some nonsensical sentences and I wanted to check,, whether the person has understood it the best way they could. So I had to scroll the movie, the the sound and it was like jumping and then searching where I am.",
            "If by playing the movie a I would see in the text the word highlighted.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "That would be perfect. That would have saved a lot of time.",
            "Yeah, I get it.",
            "So, so I think the. The most promising,,, approach is indeed the web based subtitles. So there is one more thing. IMSC1. I don't have any. I'll I'll paste the link to to chat window now. There is some render there. Have a look at that. I'm afraid that. Is downloaded here, okay, so there is there is some. Oh, the file is not found. So I'm not sure if this works at all. But. Media in seconds. Yeah. So this is some render of one of the formats of subtitles. Yeah and it is XML based TTML playing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is another important link that I found yesterday or the da day before yesterday and that's,, the jungle of video streaming. And it also has,, a section on. Oh, that's already about subtitles, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there is the. If you scroll like to the fifth of the document,, quite early. From the Monty Python and the Holy Grail,, there is four,, four formats. So the burned into video, the open captions is what we want to achieve from something which is easier to produce for ourselves. So the TTML looks,,, like reasonable, that's what the render, that's what the render would be able to, to show. So yeah, this is a subtitle. The idea is here. So, there is -. The the oh so there is some diagram of different T, TTML profiles. That's crazy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "It's really like haven't read it yet. So this is obvly obviously overly complicated. Finally to bring some sense of the circus of profiles, yes. Recent specification, yeah,, IM, IMSC1 which is a new recommendation. So this IMSC1 is probably the best thing. Specification. And then fortunately -. And it,, consists of plain text but it can reference CSS for styling.",
            "Okay.",
            "So in one of the demo queues -. Start may be applied using simple mark up to appear at particular times. Yes, so if you search for the word karaoke in this document you exactly get the.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the section web VTT.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So there is a specification. Supports play out of web PGE in a ORGANIZATION16 HLS and MPEG dash. So web VT web VTT is the best thing. Unified packager can convert SRT.",
            "When preparing content as intended for use on the web only, web VGT has deeper integration which will probably make it better suited than TTML. Yes, so we should go for a web VTT.",
            "Okay.",
            "By doing this, we are already preparing for,, like the,, the sessions, the remote conferencing for example.",
            "So if we know how to produce web VTT then,, it's,, it will be useful,, useful later on. So this this IMSC1 is probably more complicated than needed. I don't know if there is any web VTT renderer. Web VTT renderer.",
            "So this karaoke will have the audio playing. I mean,, so like last week I chunked the audios, segmented the audios. So I need to, I need to concatenate all these audio segments. I mean.",
            "So, so, so, what you,, you you are talking about the ORGANIZATION10, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly, I am.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So exactly, this is this is now needed. So, well I would first debug the the karaoke viewer on the individual segments. So do it segment by segment. But then, after,, the karaoke,, preview is is ready,, concatenate all the segments back.",
            "Or actually use the original the original file and concatenate the forced,,, the,, like time stamped,, captions.",
            "Okay.",
            "With concatenating of the,, of of this of the transcripts, you need to shift the time stamps obviously.",
            "Shift. Like what do you mean shift.",
            "Oh well, the problem is that in segment 1 time 0 means 0 but in segment 2 time 0 means something else. It's at the end of,, segment 1.",
            "The forced aligner runs always like from the beginning of the segment.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the timing of the words is relative to big relative to the beginning of the segment.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "But the beginnings of the segments like grow in time as as you proceed through,, through the recording.",
            "Aha. Yeah I've seen like I've just I was just playing some of the audios and it would I don't remember the word. It was. So the the audio is not properly captured inside that very audio segment.",
            "And and it's too little.",
            "So.",
            "So so the time stamps stamps were not exact so that's I I had to like,, you know play with the time stamps to get the actual audio captured. Or to hear the audio actually captured.",
            "Yeah, so I've played the set, the sequence of files that you have created the the simple karaoke.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And I've heard that it's like the word has been already said in on the previous word and only now the caption comes. So the captions are late.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "And I think the reason is that,, the neural network,, takes some time to process it in a way. So it is confident about the word only after the word has been finished.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "And I think that we can live with this. So the karaoke will will show this to us. And we could do some like a general little shift if we really like but I I think it's safer to to stick to what network has provided us with.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So,,, so,, there is two things the conversion of the output of forced aligner, which is the time stamped words. Into,, into the ka.",
            "Time stamped.",
            "Into the karaoke, into the VTT.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And and talk to PERSON21. So think.",
            "Okay.",
            "Is there already a script that converts the output of forced aligner to PERSON21's expected output? Which is the growing sentences. Or not yet?",
            "Yeah exactly. There is a script which PERSON21 created but I was playing with it last night but it didn't seem to work out.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I thought maybe it's an issue with the karaoke corpus is not able to process. I I even tried with the demo corpus. That demo directory which is n the forced alignment directory. And it it perfectly but I even.",
            "Aha.",
            "But the other one in the directory does not work. With this PERSON21's script so I I need to talk to PERSON21.",
            "Yes, please please talk to him and I think that format that his script provides. Which is the growing sentences is the ideal input format for,, for the web VTT view.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So,, we would be like gradually highlighting more and more of the sentence and then we would every now and then move to another subtitle and and again have the colour grow,.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So this is,, this is probably what we, what we want ot start with. So so you should first,, write these web VTT files manually just to see that it works.",
            "Then play with them, like have them appear, have them,, have them work in your set up.",
            "And then create the script which converts the growing sentences of PERSON21 into this web VTT for the for the life view of of for the preview of of these files. And then,, work on the concatenation of the Khan Academy,, transcripts,, so that the time stamps are properly shifted and then,, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, I just need to write it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the first step will be to convert the. I need to convert the subtitles into web VTT.",
            "Yeah, so learn how how to write the web VTT so that it highlight the beginning of the the first half of the subtitle and that you can grow the highlighted part in time.",
            "Okay, alright, alright.",
            "Then apply it on one of the segments and test that it works. And then apply it on the concatenated segments and test it against the original full non-split ASR. Non-split sound file.",
            "So I I'm still like confused. So first I the the karaoke, in karaoke so so the the audio that play in the background it will have. No the audio playing in the background in karaoke it will be the original audio with,, with the audio segment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, and the the subtitles. The, the, sorry, the the transcripts will be the original transcripts not from the forced aligner.",
            "From the forced aligner. Those. So the original -. When you say original transcript,, you mean the manually revised files which we called OST, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so the OST files contain only one sentence per line.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "And no time stamps so there is no way to display them. We need to move from OST to something which we call OSTT. So that's original sound transcript transcribed. Sorry sorry transcript time stamped. So the TT the second T is for time stamped,, and that is the format which has time stamps and the same line is like repeated and it's growing. In the same way as you,, know it from,, from the ASR outputs.",
            "And in order to get this OSTT I will use PERSON21's sript.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Okay, alright alright. So it will ahve the audio playing in the background and these OSTT.",
            "Yeah, so I will I will try to figer out, f find one video which displays the.",
            "Yeah exactly and.",
            "Yeah so this is like so no one is singing. Yeah, I'm searching -. Yeah, so here is one sample YouTube video where no-one sings. But if you wanted to sing like PERSON17,, you would you sing at the point when the word is, is being highlighted.",
            "Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah. I was -. Okay, so. I understand it better and it's more clear. One issue is that. I saw at first, in after the forced alignment, after every,. I mean so the forced aligner loses a few first words in the transcript.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "I'm not sure why.",
            "That's bad. So talk to PERSON20 about this. So I know that he has added something which ensures that,,, the for that his ASR processes full words. Because if you if you cut sound in the middle of the word it happily tries to like recover from that and it will recover this half word into a full word. So his search is for like a chunk, he he removes the head and tail so that he is confident that he has full words. But for the forced aligner we should not use this feature. So talk to him of what is the proper way of,, of using this forced aligner so that it doesn't chop out the the words.",
            "Okay.",
            "If it's something more complex. If he does not have this chopping off end, head and tail, then, well we're we're screwed. There is not. There is nothing we can do about it.",
            "So actually it does not happen in like all of the chunks but like in some. Okay so it's be better if I show you here.",
            "And I will start the. So can can you see this?",
            "Yeah. It said that you started. Yes I see something. But it's pretty small.",
            "Yeah, exactly. And I I okay.",
            "So maybe just Control + should increase the font size.",
            "Like this?",
            "Yes, it takes a while until it updates. So yes this is this readable. And I can see line number 2, line number 1 is still,, like obsured by your your window and my window. Oh no I can mo move it, okay. I cannot move myself, so,, -",
            "So yeah, even second segment is good. So you can see the segment. It starts from A.V.E-.",
            "F.",
            "Yeah, but it is about the second segment. But if you want this. I would like to show you this.",
            "This is, this is \"have\" this should be \"have\".",
            "I I I exactly so. The sentence is. The sentence is: \"Do I have to\".",
            "So even \"Do I?\"",
            "So it completely, so it completely missed this \"Do I\".",
            "Yeah. So talk to PERSON20. I have no idea what, why this could be happening. Send him these two files, the input file and the output file.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Just actually send him the path name of that,, of this adjacent files but copy paste that these two lines into the into the email right away.",
            "Yeah, exactly, exactly. So, yeah talked about this. Okay, so the last question is about an email which you sent a few days ago or probably last week.",
            "So you talked about the alphabets in forced alignments and there was this configuration file.",
            "And at the bottom point it w it had a list of letters which forced alignment accepts. So it was. If I properly understand what this means is that forced alignment can only accept a lower case letters, no punctuations and no upper case letters. Is that is that?",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Alright.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. Say.",
            "But beware I think that the Czech model accepts only upper case. So it's like -. That's very much configuration dependant.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "So, so have a look at the. For now you need only English forced aligner. So for now focus on the English.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And there is. I think it accepts apostrophe as well. But not new lines obviously and not,, not numbers so there. So we need to do some trick with numbers,, so the numbers should be actually spelled out.",
            "There are not too many numbers but there are some in the,, in the transcripts.",
            "Like what you mean of.",
            "Like 2020.",
            "2 0 in yeah in numbers.",
            "So if you have 2020 then in the transcript like as one word, like 4 characters 2 0 2 0. Then it should be spelled out in some way in which it was spelled out. In the,, in the text. So that's. Well this is annoying,, well we'll see how far we get with this, like. PERSON20 will know how to convert numbers to the spoken versions of them, because he. Also had to do it guess. So talk to him about this as well.",
            "Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",
            "For Czech, PERSON5 surely has a script that does that.",
            "Obviously the person, the person could have said the number differently,, and then we are screwed.",
            "But yeah. This is not so likely.",
            "So you you mean these numbers are not acceptable in the forced aligner.",
            "The forced aligner,, oh,, yeah, it's just yeah. It just, it just doesn't work. It excess it expects the the letters that corresponds to the,, to the like vowels and consonants of the to the phonemes in the in the speech. And if the letters are the the digit 2 then there,, is no clear correspondence to phonemes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah so it all. So basically I need to refer to the configuration files. Yeah, okay. And that is all that I have written down. And I will start working on this karaoke, then I will discuss with PERSON21 and then I I will start working on the log. To get the log directories for the,,, for the meeting for the last conference. And I -.",
            "Yeah, for the mock conference, great. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, for the mock conference.",
            "And when I, when I talked about the getting the versions of the systems. This is something which can be tested on anything, including the mock conferences obviously. So.",
            "Version of the system, like what do you mean.",
            "So like in the log dir we need to know which version of the ORGANIZATION1 system was in use.",
            "Okay, alright.",
            "This was, this was mentioned in the call,, this morning.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I understand, yeah.",
            "So this is, this also an opportunity to, to like work on that, on gathering that information.",
            "Okay, okay. And these log directories. So basically,, we had like, I don't know what we had appro, we had like 6 channel being spoken in this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this. These audio recordings have 6 channel so I need to separate each of them out and do the ASR.",
            "They are already separated.",
            "Oh, well the record cut script work for them. So maybe they are already separate files.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Or the record cut script, yeah.",
            "Okay, so by preparing you mean generating the ASR and generating the MNTs, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Time stamped.",
            "Yes, so for for now you need to do it for each of the channels separately.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And you can do it one by one. You do not have to do it at the same time.",
            "Yeah, exactly, yeah.",
            "The good thing about these channels is that they start at very same. They are synchronised.",
            "So they start at the time 0 and that's perfect. So, that means that we can then observe all the many different English versions and the time stamps will will match. So we would be like playing for ourselves the different English versions simultaneously and trying to figure out which of them is the best at the given moment. So we should like. So when you prepare these log dirs we should then run a test session with annotators including ourselves and,, figuring out at what time stamps. At what stamps of time we prefer this English at what times do we prepare this one. So like time based labelling which of the English streams is good.",
            "And then,, after we figure out how to do it ourselves, we can consider what should be the user interface for anybody, like a non-skilled person. And whether the task as such is is doable at all. Or whether it is too much load on the on the human brain.",
            "Okay, okay, okay. And that's -. Like so suppose the main audios the main speaker in, is speaking in French.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we have the interpretation, interpreter in Czech.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I need to get the English ORGANIZATION2, from the,, from the Czech interpreter.",
            "Yes.",
            "Otherwise English ORGANIZATION2 from the French ASR.",
            "Yes, if we have system for that, yes.",
            "And then we need to check which English is better.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Is that, is that what you are talking about. Right?",
            "Yes, exactly. Yeah.",
            "Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, like okay, is it's it's clear now.",
            "So I'm afraid that the ORGANIZATION2 room will, is booked for 2 minutes more only and then it will possibly close.",
            "Okay, okay, yeah, I I I I'm I'm done I'm done. Yeah, okay, okay. So thank you for your time again and yeah. And have a great.",
            "Great, thanks. I'll be in the office in the afternoon from like 3, 4ish till,, probably 7 or 8. Today. But but you don't have to come.",
            "Department?",
            "Yeah, well on foot it's it's not far from, far away from me, for me so it's it's a nice exercise.",
            "Okay, alright. Yeah. So, yeah, okay, so,. Let's, let's yeah, let's speak.",
            "Yeah but you don't have to, you don't have to come there in person at at all.",
            "Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Thank you then.",
            "Great, thanks. And and talk to you. We'll be in touch. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, sure. Okay. Bye.",

Due to the limitations of the connection, I don't really want to be with you for the whole – for the whole thirty minutes, So I just wanted to ask you if you contribute to the document. I see that PERSON8 has done it, PERSON3 is still working on the paper, great, and PERSON6 is here. That – that's good. So this is a rare opportunity for you to talk directly to PERSON6 from – from September. When we restart this calls we will find a date, which is – time, which is suitable also for PERSON6. So PERSON6 is, as you know, working on the PROJECT3 test set and he was supposed to have colleague who would supervise the annotators, but just yesterday the colleague set that she –. Due to heath reasons she cannot join us. So we're still searching for someone to help with the supervision of annotators.",
            "Yes, I have an idea.",

So we definitely need some – some support. So if we'll not be like he would work and not work till the end of the project, but it will be some work and we need a person for that, so, please ask, that – that's great.",

            "Yeah, well, the that's life, so if you still find something, that would be great, but obviously there will be other conferences, so don't – don't worry.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, thank you, And we also have PERSON9 in the call, So PERSON9, do you have the link to the document that we are always –.",
            "Sorry – sorry I have some problems, can you repeat it?",
            "Do you have the link to the document that we are always editting? The PROJECT3 Surge –.",
            "Yes, yes, I – I have opened it.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah, so – so – so, please, just add what – you have been working on or your state exam is over, or is it still going to happen?",
            "That's actually the reason, why PERSON8 is substituting me,",
            "Okay.",
            "Because I – I have –. They –. I have always, so –.",
            "Yeah, okay, clear. All clear, yeah, so that's –. I'll – I'll keep my fingers crossed for that, because Thank you. unfortunately for the defence date, which is the same date –.",
            "It's a day before.",
            "Yeah, so on neither of these days I'll be in LOCATION1, I still have to actually write the – the positive review for your thesis, but then someone will read it and it should be PERSON1. So that's – yeah, that's what I remember. I wanted to –. I remember one thing and that is from PERSON2, Because PERSON2 would still seek someone, who would implement the user interface, some simple annotation tool for the minuting annotation. And I know that PERSON9 had many thoughts about it, but then obviously you were busy with the – the systems, the thesis, now the state exams –. In the summer, would you like to would you have time to work on this and would you like to? Or are we kind of in the search for another person?",
            "I am still planning to work on that.",
            "Okay, yeah, so the – so that's – that's good. So if you are planning that's – that's great, so that – that will be –. I think you are in the best position to do that, But still I –. Yeah, I just wanted to – to say that PERSON2 is now in the s in the situation where we would – where she would like to have the tool, But I'll –. Like state exam is the – is a very good excuse.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I –. How about the –. Oh, great,, do we have a meeting to work crazy? Yes! So, that's a very good remark from PERSON8 and it also considers PERSON9, So, I'm – I'll try to find the slot, and I'll – I'll be –. I assume, PERSON9, you are available anytime, but actually you should not like spend any time with our things than – than learning, right?",
            "It would be better for me, yeah, if I could connect remotely.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So I'll try to find some slots tomorrow or on Thursday, because we need to discuss some ORGANIZATION3 grant and that – that considers PERSON9 and you as well, and ANNOTATOR1 and PERSON4. So that's like a foreseen – foreseen thing, And thanks for the reminder, that's – that's very good one.",
            "I'm sorry, we're also supposed to have a meeting together tomorrow, –.",
            "Yes.",
            "Will you be available?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, that holds, so I –. Maybe a time little late, because at 8: 30 I will be collecting something at Plzeňská street and then I'll get to ORGANIZATION1, Okay., but the – otherwise it – it should be fine. Yeah, and I have PERSON11 for 9: 30, So I'll – I – I hope not to be late.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah. So from my point of view s. From my point of view I don't have anything on you, because I need to review all the deliverables and make sure that they are done and, So I'm overloaded with this. And then obviously with some exams correction of – of the exams. And PERSON4, yeah. Okay, so, that's probably yeah, great. So I think that's – that's everything from – from me and if you don't have anything extra urgent, then –. I would like to ask someone to stay on the call just in case others come late for the remaining 19 minutes, But if no one comes, then I think we're – we're done. Do the idea, as you see, is that over the summer everybody should be working their hours, Those that you are being paid for or if you are on the flexible hours then whatever is needed. And –. But we don't have –. We won't have these – these calls, And we will start them with September. Yeah, so, that's –. As far as I can think this is – that's everything I wanted to say, So, when you are not working, then enjouy summer. It's summer day today. Hopefully it will remain for a while and hopefully will be not too hot and too dry and – and – again. Yeah, okay. So, if – if you don't have anything –.",
            "Hi, it's PERSON5 here.",
            "Yes, okay, hi PERSON5. PERSON9, he's labeled like PERSON8.",
            "Yeah, I'm using PERSON8's –. So I – I – don't have task – I don't have tasks this week.",
            "Probably today PERSON9 has gave me recognition to keep the work on –. I think that's the –. Well, yeah, that's.",
            "You have – you have the big summer task and the big summer task is to clean the start fol the starting folder.",
            "Yeah, yeah yeah, the – the of the control instead your.",
            "Yeah, the control, clean-up of the control. So, whenever you s your mind says I don't have anything to do, then this is a big thing and you need to chip it off like bit by bit, Slowly clean clean it up. There is one thing that the demo – the demo session that we had for the project officer –. So actually everybody after this, I'm sure. The demo technically went very well, But the response is that the quality still needs to be improved. So,, so the users are – like they were happy about the way the demo was presented and technically everything worked perfectly. But the quality of all the components is below what they find usable for practice. So there is a request for everyone to work on their systems, add data, re-train everything. And I'm talking about the demo because I wanted to mention –. And especially in front of PERSON5, that tehre will be one more such demo session, when we organise it, And it's – it will be user and advisory board, that something – some colleagues in the field, so not officers from the ORGANIZATION2, but technical colleagues. And we promised to have a meeting last year, but we forgot. So we are now trying to find a date and we will show them essentially the same demo plus any presentations on any other work-package in – in PROJECT3. So this is f warning. Please, keep the demo as it is, don't break it, But do the polishing in a new holder or whatever. And we have a person who is going to be in the similar position that you are PERSON5, once you leave, And I'm trying to get the – the biggest overlap between him and you. And hopefully he'll agree, hopefully he'll join us. And then you'll have immediately th due to your explaining evetyrhing to – to this person. So I – I cannot th confirm that for 100% yet, but we have selected him and we have notified him, so hopefully he'll.",
            "Okay,",
            "Yeah. Okay, so, now that's –. Yeah, so maybe someone could quickly take notes of what I said about the demo and the review of the demo for the PROJECT3 and advisory board. So I'll – I'll – yeah. Demo and users not quite happy, And then. Okay, so that's it. I have other things to do and I have to drive back to LOCATION1, so I'll – I'll leave now myself, But please someone for – for the remaining few minutes, until – until half past 4. Okay, right. Is that everything from everybody?",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you PERSON10.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So, thank you very much, enjoy the summer, as I said, except, obviously, when you have to work. Thank you, bye bye!"

            "And you have the participant body already a recording, and hopefully my screen is being shared. Yes. So in the ORGANIZATION7 document, a dominant has drawn a a a as, like a picture, which highlight, which shows everything, the that we will need for the mediator. So. So what we have here is the climbed gate on in the lefts hand, part of the picture is. So Klein's connecting to the mediator and the work. And we expect audio input, either English speech or Czech speech. But but the picture says, \"only English speech, for simplicity. To come to the mediators so, audio being transferred from LOCATION2,, to, the mediator in LOCATION1, or where. Okay, so I do not know where where the servers are. It is in the US, OK.",
            "West Europe.",
            "Or something like that I'm not sure. And then so this is speech,. Then from the mediator get send to ASR. They will, produce English words, because they have like two stage of, speech recognition process. And then these English words get sent back to the mediator, and then from the mediator again to. For segmenting,. And and like for concatenating these words into sentences and breaking the text into sentences. So this will produce the English sentence, and the English sentence will be sent to the mission of the system, which will run at our, place. So this is the the third worker,, here in English, to going to English check empty. And then they check. The going is going to be sent back to the mediator. And there are other clients connected. There are to be other client connected to the mediator. The first one will be the one showing the subtitles. And this is something that we do not know how to do yet, because we rely on,, presenter like presentation and video mixing. And,, we need to record for,, one of the the uses when he to record the English,, subtitles, as well. So the the English ASR so english sentence, as as emmited by the ASR, and then, we need to save everything, especially the,,, the sound signal for further use,, like to make it it that or or training data out later on,,, and one particular aspect,, that I will talk about later when, the hopefully, connect is, u, the, clearest, voice competition, where,, the participants. Will be evaluated, on their word \"error,, word error. So students coming to the will be presenting 90 seconds each, some quick presentation of their country, and we need to record the voices here into separate files,, and,, we need to,, also save the,, the automatic transcripts as obtained by the causeway ASR and then we need to evaluate these. Yes. So I would like to PERSON17, if there was anything that I forgot. And, the the maybe moment on this. Yeah. And PERSON20, does that make sence? Did is the design,, OK so far, like we have not run into any, nonexisting, pieces off a or nonexisting features of mediator.",
            "Sorry PERSON21.",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "Just after design. I think that probably,, the component register. The audio will be a worker and. He would be will be a worker and the multiplying.",
            "Ok. Yes.",
            "Fingerprint match is pretty good. We good work,. Ok, that is all, I think. PERSON20, do you have some other such.",
            "Oh, not really, just maybe one. Maybe it is some of that is already somewhere in the notes, but, there, there has to be an overview as well. And I have one important question,, and that is, whether,, worker. So now. Now, I'm talking about the recording,, and actually the the recording for the purposes of the clearest was competition there. We need to have the single session running all the time like constantly transcribing the speech, and and emmiting the the subtitles, and and so on, but we need to get the separate,, pieces for each of the speaker. So we need 90 seconds long files. So if we have a worker that will,, be like ready to to save. Can such a worker connect to an existing a pipeline to an existing session and disconnect,, and connect again for the next,, speaker, or. Do we need to have one worker being connected to the same pipeline, all the time,, link through fingerprints like connected to with the help of the fingerprints. And then the worker internally has to stop saving to one file and move on to saving to another file the.",
            "Both of the option, sorry,, ther is always the clients who manage the session, then, in order to have different files, you have to run different session, when you want to stop recording. The first file, you have to stop the client and start again for the second session.",
            "OK. So, if,, was existing,, workers that are able to save the data. One would have indeed stop the client, and restart the client. And another option would be as I suggested to, modify worker, so that the worker will be,, like constantly part of the the single session,, and it would be saving or not saving depending on some other information it gets from elsewhere. So it could be like a,, as a process running in the director looking into the directory. And if the directory contains a special file a like safe into file name one. Then it will be saving the data. If there is no such file it will not be saving the data and and so on.",
            "At the moment it is not possible out of the service architecture,, idea,.",
            "And why why is that not possible like. I feel that it is not possible, because we do not have such worker. But is there. Any reason why such worker cannot be you implemented?",
            "Our recomendation would be to keep the log of the speech, recording will be.",
            "So I understand, but we probably have participant here, So, Yeah. We definitely want to have one worker that will be saving everything. So, and then we would like a to have also another worker, which would save the the,, individual presentations. And the reason,, is need to have already during the day, you. Yeah. I hello. Yeah. So we are now in the middle of,, uf some setup that is not not so relevant. So let let me quickly finish this. And then we will start with the with the the most important part of the meeting. So, the the. So we want to have to workers for recording, one would be the standard audio recorder non, interrupted producing a the single file, but we need also separate files. As soon as any of the presenters stop their 90 seconds. We need this file saved and transfer to another place. And in terms of like two minutes or three minutes from then on. The person will be transcribing their own speech. So that is why we need separate files. And for this. We would like to have a second worker. I understand now, that the second worker must not interrupt the,, the session. The second worker will be connected all the time. And it would. It has to be modified in a way, so that it saves a the into a separate files. Does that work? Does that make sense PERSON20?",
            "Yes, if you if you modify. The signal.",
            "Yes. For some reason, your your voice his little bit interrupted at times. Maybe the. The connection is is not not a reliable. Yeah, we also have backup solution for this. Like interrupted worker. The backup solution is to use a totally independent notebook, running windows, and we will just listening to the audio signal,, and and saving a separate files. It would be different recording of from what the ASR has seen. But that would not matter for our purposes. We could later on extract the, the genuine,, signal that went to the ASR from the complete recording of the session, a when we will be making this.",
            "Another option to another option could be also to get the extra time stamp of the beginning and of the end of the speech and extracting the from the overall signal. So you it is incremental signal that you we you can exactly find the start, and the end of the speech. By the time stamp of it could be feasible to extract the the speech of one speaker from the overall recording,",
            "Yeah. We will have to see whatever it is easier whether to implement the,. The interrupted interrupted worker, or whether to, use the secondary notebook, or whether to use this idea with the the extracting the bit. Thank you. So, since we now have a person from PERSON9 as well,. Let me start. Let me start the at the beginning of the agenda, so, well, PERSON8. This is the first time we we meet nice to meet you. We were expecting either markers, or, or PERSON4. So would it be actually you.",
            "PERSON.",
            "Okay, I see yeah, a great. So so just to let, you know of this session is being recorded for the purposes of minuting making a data set for PROJECT1. Are you fine with that. I hope we are we, yes. Yeah, yeah, so there is a slack space for PROJECT1, but I do not really use it. I have a pretty bad experience with slack non not delivering messages that I as delivered on my screen. So feel free to use it. If it makes the if you want to be invited to let me or PERSON17 know. We can invite you. Feel free to use it just do not rely on it. That is what I wanted to say. So always ask people, for confirmation of received, if you.",
            "I asked for the. I started receiving the same observation from different people. I think it will be really useful for the or the the support and developers.",
            "Yes, yes,",
            "So important communication.",
            "Yeah, so feel free free to do it use whatever is is most convenient for everybody and like can be fast. I just use. I found it not delivering messages that I wrote. So I was really annoyed. Ok. So then there is the running. Thank you for the admin web. And PERSON17 asked, what is the IP the register services, was that your question. Yeah. So, is there anything that we should know,, now. Are you seeing my sharing that? Yes? So is there anything that we should know to understand what it what is now in the in the mediator.",
            "Oh, okay. Please note admin web is really used for the purposes,",
            "Yes. Use only the registered services agent. Here you will find the all the line workers and not do to check. So on. Developer. Yeah, ye exactly. I think it is very useful for for us for debugging purposes. So PERSON17 asked, what is the API. So, there is some versions or API version something. One of the the last. And this is yeah, so that probably not too important for four hours of our purposes, right. And the registered services are all the running workers. Mm-hmm. Yes, correct,. And and now all of them are idle. But if a client would connect. Some of these workers would become connected to the pipeline, and then suddenly they would be non idle, and if the another client would need the same type of service. So we would have to have another. Line, one more worker running to and to to to do that service. So, for example, this the. There is too. There is the yes. There is two German speech recognizers the first two lines and there that you English organizers.",
            "Mm-hmm. They are two session of the same worker, the German ASR. And when the client connect, one of these sessions becomes easy. Another session can be.",
            "OK. Thank you. So this is the this is the first one. Now the physical layout I would like to now. PERSON17 to to present this. And you and you can see the description in the ORGANIZATION7 Doc,, and describe what what everything when each. So please. Everybody make sure that from your point of view of you were able to like covered that that that, you have the knowledge and the tools, and they had the hardware, and and all that and will review the hardware and software later on by the physical layout is like the the beginning, right? So PERSON17 please.",
            "Hello.",
            "You did not hear PERSON17, did you? I do not hear anything.",
            "Me niether.",
            "Yeah, so I do not hear PERSON17, but PERSON17. No, we still do not hear you. But we, we were able to hear you a while ago. And it seemed that the it is the receiving,, the the to receiving voice from you, no, no still not. Okay, does not work. Yep. Okay. So no, not yet. So I will present. Now, instead of PERSON17, but PERSON17 will keep trying to make is the voice delivered. OK so. There is a four stages,, for physical places. There is also for the down in document, a the map of, of the set up. So,, four different spots where something will happen at the main stage is like a stage for. I do not know if we are 20 or 50,, people looking at one presentation, and there will be doing the,, subtitling. So, ASR, and, machine translation and presentation of subtitles. So the video mixing of subtitles and presentations,. And there will be also. We will be doing the recording of everything. For the later use. There is the secondary stage like secondary podium. And this is for perhaps fewer people but, hopefully we would like to do. Subtitling here again. If we get second video mixer. And that is the. To be discussed, below, and we will be doing the recording. One,, purpose for the recording is to have all the talks recorded. And the second purpose as the clearest voice competition, which is also have called, refer to as 90 seconds in a lift. And that is the the that is where we need the separate files per competitor, because, this. This will be transcribed right after the,, the presentation, the particle person will go to the transcription space, which is the third, spot. And there, they will listen to their to their own voice, and they will write it down to to have the reference transcript. And this is for the word \"error\" rate of evaluation. And there is, one,, further spot, and that is the offline presentation, and this will be a again. And this is just where we can show off and PROJECT1 and, the PROJECT1 partner technologies,. So ideally,, we have discussed. This was before we would like to have one more of full fledged German,, speech to,, English output or whatever offline presentation, if you have like one more one more device for this. So this would be a good. And for this. We will need roll-up. And there is also the, the option to make it more attractive. Just like we visualy more effective, a by of,, the robot know that, we have like that. The the school of informatic has one but. I can borrow it only under the condition that it will somehow like actively,, perform in this presentation. So if we are able to use it as a, as a PERSON19, or as speakers or this as a good reason to, to have. It were a attract people. But, the, the one that the colleague of mine, who owns this robot that he does not want just it just as that like,,, as the young, ladies selling whatever car tires. So he prefers the, the the advertisement. You have some some real real value. Yep. So, PERSON17. Please keep trying. I still have not hear you. You would like to,, hand over. No. Okay? So you are in yeah. So please PERSON17 please keep trying, I will let you know when when you are heard again, OK. So, the critical thing that has to be negotiated,, and discussed with the organizers of the fair, the the company. This is the is the wiring. So, we need. We need to specify what we need. And they can acomodate to some of these requests. And right now, I would like you all to validate that I have described this correctly. And then if if we if, the organizers, if PERSON7 is not able to, meet these requirements or the specification, then we will talk again and find another solution. So and the main stage. We expect to connect. The male XLR connector. Which is, on this picture to the mixing device to get sound. Is that right, or should it be another connector. Well, obviously, you are probably flexible, but we need to have something to show them. This is half way up high school students, and we need to show them pictures to, to get the right a to get the right thing. So is this correct. Yeah,. So, for the headsets,, we have sent you an email some time ago. I'm not sure if you have responded. Oh, I have heard that it is very important to have a the mic and distance from the mouth. So, we are happy to to buy some of the like headset mics. But we do not. We need to know which, so if someone, you know, if someone from, could could just paste, your, into this document,, and, we would buy some above the the time is running short. So,,. So the sooner we get the the better, and. We, we need to talk to, this is especially for PERSON2,, to make sure that they are happy with us providing the headsets and with the way these headsets connect to their mixing device. And and so on.",
            "OK.",
            "OK could you. Maybe that male with link to the headsets again. And can not find it right now.",
            "So there was PERSON2's email with questions. And one of the questions was about the headsets. And there was no answer. So we need. We need some your from you. We do not have any any preference. So this is a. This is a confirmed,, confirmed by ORGANIZATION1. ORGANIZATION1 will suggest some headsets. PERSON2 will negotiate their connection with PERSON7. That is the organizer of the. So which. So here is the here is the place for the. And,, how many so we expect that it will be one speaker presenting only. We will will not be able to transcribe if two people speak at the same time. Anyway,. So the, we will have two at most. I would say to swap them, like if if there is to be to be two speakers coming one after another, one can be setting this up for for themselves. And the other would be already speaking right. So two should be fine? Or would you recommend more?",
            "Well of course, more is always better bit i think two should be fine. I mean, it would probably also worked with just one, but then, of course, gets little bit more time critical, so to say, and.",
            "Okay. So then we expect PERSON7,. Then we expect PERSON7, to provide us with the presentations that we need subtitles to mix into. And we do not know the they have old technology or new technology. So we expect them to have either VGA or HDMI. And this is something that they would be normally connecting to their overhead projector. But instead of this, they would connect it to the female, a VGA or HDMI right?",
            "Yes. So and so far, I only used VGA as input to our. It should also be able to capture VGA, but I personally have not really tried it. So I think is not a problem. But VGA we have to check if it really works.",
            "Um-hum. Yeah, so could you check,,, because,, or should check with PERSON7. But I'm afraid they will use VGA. And there it needs to digitize the,, the signals. So if if. So, yeah, a check with PERSON7. And even if they say, \"It is the modern thing,, who would be better if if you have tested the the VGA ourselves with them. Or well, VGA signal.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And that was sorry, who whose voice was that a was. Yeah, PERSON15 will test. PERSON2 will ask PERSON7.",
            "Yeas I just found the mail. When I sent it,, I sent it on february 26. I did not heard from anyone.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yep.",
            "So maybe PERSON2 sent this email now to everyone. People are listed at the top of this, the, of this list in the ORGANIZATION7 document.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that was that was the email about the, the devices that headsets to buy. And and so on, okay,, thank you. So then we expect video mixing notebook to be there. So the,, that will be connected to. And he will be also connected that is it. So is it the same notebook as the one that gets the speech signal, or is it separate notebook? I am asking because of the ethernet connection, because we will have only one ethernet male cable there.",
            "Okay, so it will be, I think laptop so to be really independent, but this one does not need Internet. So everything. Separate laptop to to have things around independently. So. If something happens, we can easily restart one of the two,.",
            "Mm-hmm,",
            "Network.",
            "Yeah, two notebooks,, provided by both needs, wired connection.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Important. Okay. So we need to make sure that we have two cables, or that we bring our own. Well further for that one more not becauset I guess that when they when they. I do not know how they will set up the network. So the easiest option is to,, to bring one more network, others translating router.",
            "My suggestion PERSON21 would be also to check the internet configuration. I mean, the Ip configuration if it is provided by DHCP on the overall ethernet or what or whatever it has to be done.",
            "And yeah, exactly, And,,, double check was PERSON7 the IP figuration, the DHCP, or static addreses so whatever.",
            "And maybe the firewall settings in general because I think connect to the mediator uses unusual ports.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So just to be sure that there is nothing in between that keeps us from from running there.",
            "Yeah. And the. And the overall bandwidth. So this is something that will probably come to,, a later. But at the beginning. We have already discussed that there is quite a traffic, going on. So most important is the speech,, or the heaviest is the speech, and, it will be an ideally two stages, sending speech. Fortunately, we are not delivering speech anywhere. So it will be done the translation and subtitles coming back, but we are need we do need to record a, also on the spot. So for the for the backup purposes. The recording can be done like remotely, not at not at the fair,, but a for the clearest voice competition. It would probably be better to record the voice already on the spot. And that would mean, the like two audio's coming from the fair to the mediator and one audio one of them coming back again for the saving, right? Am I correct? So what is the bandwidth that this will need. What what should we tell the the PERSON7. They mentioned something like it will be one of the standard, like connections, but I do not know what they. Style.",
            "Yeah so i think the critical part, because we are sending audio,, would definitly be the upstream. So I think with one megabit upstream, we should be on the safe side, because audio is not really that intensive. But of course, we have to have it reliable so if we have high and things will brake.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Good connexion with one megabit upstream then the downstream should also be fine for displaying the subtitles.",
            "Yeah, okay. And even for getting the,, the one of the streams for the recording back, right? So the clearest was composition as as I described the there is a that someone is speaking. We are ideally subtitling this. And after every speaker every 90 seconds. We need to stop the recording create a separate file. So that would be to recordings going on one for the like continuous non, interrupted backup purpose recording, and another one would be this like interrupted style of recording. And this interrupted style of recording,, would,, also need the the audio stream come down again from the mediator to the stage. So the should,, that should still fit. Yeah, it has to be reliable, the. So thank you for the confirmation PERSON14. So this reliability thing that is for a PERSON2 to double check with PERSON7. And this is exactly the last mile bit. So what we do not want PERSON7 to provide would be some LTE any well, LTE are also quite reliable, but we will need some serious wired connection for the, to have that reliability that is last mile thing. Yeah. And we need to talk to the technical people in advance. To to double check the IP config, and the firewall that is that important. Thank you.",
            "Just just the question PERSON21. When would it be possible to check the network connection.",
            "The day before I'm afraid and maybe like very late on the day because they they.",
            "Join. We can go to the place where the fair trade will take place on on the 19 after two PM. So, we can there.",
            "The wires should be, the wires should be there already, or the, still when when PERSON7 will start with their wiring.",
            "Well,, the main wires should be there, because in the on the 19th in the morning, the company will go there and install the and yeah, and the wire. So it should be there. Hopefully.",
            "In the morning PERSON7 will.",
            "And technically speaking,, fair trade starts on Wednesday. Probably in the afternoon. So the whole Wednesday morning, we will have probably time to check if everything is like running, and okay.",
            "Yeah, OK so. Hopefully we have, we, have half a day, or even perhaps two halves of of day,, to get things running. Okay,, then the secondary stage. And this is where the, where the the competition clearest voice will be happening. Here we expect again the XLR connector to connect to the mixing device to get the the input to get the, the audio. Now can bring also the notebooks for this stage, or should we, cover it? Like you have a double set up or, or. This is something to to to to consider, and and maybe answer later. Again, what we expect the, that we will provide the headsets. To the speakers. I think for this one. We, should probably get three, because, two will be needed. There is a yeah. Well, actually, I think we should get even four. I would say, three to four, because there is some. In some of these 90 second sessions two people will be presenting the country at the same time, and we are running two separate tracks of this competition. If the people speak after one after another. The ASR should be able to handle it. But if the people start talking, at the same time, then the ASR will fail. So we need to have fair comparison between participants that have this risk of failing. And the participants that do not have the risk of failing. And that is why we have to evaluate.",
            "Yeah. So so I think we have two people speaking in parallel then we also need to make sure that we can input two audio signals the same time into our infrastructure.",
            "Yeah. I do not think this will be possible. We will. We can try. But I think that there will be actually only one mixing,, like device, and they will not. I'm not sure if will be too. If we will be able to connect to the separate separate channels for the two speakers. So the solution is to assume only one channel and say that the this one channel. If it is the used by two persons at the same time, will fail. And that is why we have the separate track. So preferably, yes, yeah, the the the the, i will write it down. So, preferably, the get to separate voice channels channels. But,, we actually, count on having only one and, saying that ASR fails with a two people speaking at the same time. Yeah. So will see, for this. So, PERSON2 should should should check with PERSON7, the exact,, mixing, device that up. To, learn if we can, have, two channels or just one.",
            "I just email to everyone here. So you should have recieve it.",
            "Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.",
            "So actually really go for the second option here, which is saying, and we have ones input channel and then say okay ASR may fail if there people speaking at the same time, because if you do have two separate channels, and would also need two separate recording setups, and I do not know, and it just gets more complicated. So which is really a as good one output and if. The speaker. So to say, behave and only speak one after the another we are fine. But in the other case. It will not work.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So let us let us. Let us make it simple from the beginning of the number of headsets that is still higher, because we need. Like two people are getting their headsets on, and twi people having. So I would say four,, four for this stage. So two times two needed. And one could be for,, for backup, if one of them fails, or something like that, because it is going to get time critical. So we need two two people putting their headsets on and. We actually. We count on having only one channel channel and say that ASR may fail. Well. It fail I do not think it, or would it? Can it succeed in it at all succeed. If it? Yeah, I think that ASR will fail. Yeah,, that is so, but anyway,, we should check. I will delete this now, but we should check with PERSON7 how to connect our headsets. Now two of them to the same mixing device so that it gets both amplified for the participants the sitting in the auditorium as well, as for, the the for the notebook to to send it to. Ok, for the video mixing. This is unclear. We do not have a second, and we will come to this the, later on. So the. The worst option is that we are not able to present subtitles jointly with the. So, we can have another, likes separate overhead projector and project, the subtitles elsewhere on the on the wall, or like over the slides and the same space, slightly like damaging, the, the picture, or we could only have the subtitles present online in one of the what pages that a will will probably have running. And we can build participant. If you have your own internet connection. You can watch the subtitles here. So the the the the worst situation is that we do not provide any subtitles in the room for for the physically present people. If you have any other tips. Then, let me know, but will it will come to this. It is mainly related to the, thing. So the the critical thing is, how many notebooks are there. Can you bring one more for the voice recording or should wee, a cover that.",
            "So I think we should have one more for voice recording that we can use, but do not have that many notebook in general. So if you have one just to be on safe side and i think we have, one more that we can bring, but we have to check. Yeah,, a backup. So, we are. We also like need to do what we need to scrutinize, how many notebooks we have for this. So PERSON2, this is this for you to have to make sure that we have something. And it should be a whatever Linux right?",
            "Well. If we use it to display the the subtitles and it cant be any operating system for the recording client. We mainly use Linux or or Mac machines here, but I think that the architecture itself should be platform independent so I mean we have also installed our client on Windows machine. Yeah we mainly use, ORGANIZATION4 as recording program.",
            "Yeah, so the presentation of the subtitles independent,, like on a separate overhead projector is easy that can be done really with anything. If we do have the second then we would need actually to make this notebook, the video mixing one, and that would, then have to be Linux.",
            "And it does not have to be so, so so far, we used to video mixing on windows machines, because they, the driver situation is much more easier, especially on a screen capture devices. So, I also got it to work on the Mac ones, but actually havent used it with the Linux yet.",
            "Sorry I need to interrupt you, because I will have to leave, I just wanted to ask ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION1, who will be coming? For the fair trade.",
            "I will be there, if you can please send me information where I can stay for the staying..",
            "Sure okay.",
            "Should setup everything and when we have to attempt exactly.",
            "Okay, so I don't know if you have to be there on Tuesday, I don't think so. But on the Wednesday, in the morning from 9AM till 12, there will be like the installation of the like promotion boot, so someone from you will have to prepare the offline offline demo and so on. And in the morning we will be probably testing if everything is running.",
            "Okay, so. The afternoon is with.",
            "Yes.",
            "On Tues a on Thursday and on Friday so some presentation or.",
            "On Thursday on the small stage the will be the competition during the whole day, I guess so, and on Friday its again only half day because from 12 to 1PM there will be like the final ceremony and the closing and so and from 1PM till 2PM there will be like cleaning and packing and then its the end of the fair.",
            "Should be from Wednesday to Friday.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. From Wednesday morning preferably.",
            "Yes.",
            "Guess we have little bit to discuss who is attending.",
            "Okay.",
            "Information with joining.",
            "Okay, great.",
            "And remember there is like quite some heavy hardware that you will be bringing so, its one notebook for the offline show, two notebooks for the main stage and then if you have one notebook or perhaps even two for the secondary stage right? So it could be up to five, notebooks. And one. Have you taken note?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, thank you. So then there is the for this is mainly for us this is like you you need to less about this. There is this transcription space. Where likely there have been no ethernet connection, a and only on Wi-Fi wireless. Which is like it will not be given for use to the other participants of the. Because the every booth will will set up their own Wi-Fi.",
            "I didnt heard you PERSON21.",
            "Oh, am I muted? No, whats wrong. Just the signal was.",
            "Okay, yeah. So what I was saying is that at the transcription space, which is where the participants of the ninety seconds the interval. Of the in the elevator, they will come to the transcription space, and they will transcribe their own speech, we don't expect wired connection there. We expect only wireless. Which will share the same bandwidth to the Internet with the wired connection, a and additionally has the risk of of being crammed with other people's Wi-Fi's. This is what will have to live with. But this is not a like online show this is still happening during the day. But there is some room for like for delays. And there is the offline presentation booth, I would just like to double check whether PERSON7 providing a power socket there right? I think so.",
            "Yes, they are. One.",
            "Yeah yeah, one will will will make sure that we have extended course, this is okay. There is no internet and Wi-Fi. Okay? So now they now I think PERSON2 can leave for her purposes. There is a hope that will be anything. The video mixer, yes. So we have run into the problem that Epiphan that you have is probably no longer available,, because they have moved only to man way more expensive devices. So the question is whether we can get different video recording device. So one option is to get older ones that will be the first link, and another option would be to select from, the, the car, and ones by other vendors. And I'm not sure if the if you like, what is the best setup. This is the random. I'm not. I'm not sure what I'm looking for the for. So if if ORGANIZATION1 can help me that will be great.",
            "Yes, in general, I would prefer devices from Epiphan simply because they are made for professional use. So they should supported wider variety of input resolutions as well as input signals. So so to say, analog inputs as a VGA and HDMI. Whereas on the second link I mainly see some recording equipment for gamers, and that typically limited to the typical 720p 1080p resolutions digital only inputs, and it may not be so flexible within the use.",
            "Yeah, but if theres.",
            "Use those before I mean devices.",
            "Yeah, so you would rather recommend older Epiphan from ORGANIZATION6 over new device.",
            "So I would recommend older Epiphan device over a new gaming elgato what they are, so I would not buy gaming recording device.",
            "Well maybe there is further down the list this is probably sorted by the price, not this is so price low to high that will be. This would be the gaming so or price high to low so AverMedia is something that you would say would be okay, no this is still game capturing.",
            "Yeah its probably, I mean what I see here its mainly game capturing. I mean they they they may work I just havent used those.",
            "Well if.",
            "This is something that in theory could also be fixed within VGA HDMI convertor.",
            "Yeah but its further configuration work and.",
            "And another device.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So and of the older Epiphans, because we were unable to find a new one, is there anything on the ORGANIZATION6 that you could like tell us by this. And we we are happy to to like spend 4 and half thousand czech crowns from the United States to be from China. But I have no idea which is the correct one, to to order. Obviously subject is actually broken.",
            "They probably from top to bottom I think the first one looks okay.",
            "So the external video grabber yeah, DVI to USB 3.",
            "Question is are there any input because its been shipped from US.",
            "I am no idea.",
            "Figure out also, yeah, PERSON4 been shipped from US and it probably will be make it in time. Other one from from Israel. So in general itself. At Epiphan.",
            "Yes. And apparently they don't sell those cheaper ones any any more, and instead they sell only something which is 10 times more expensive. Or more.",
            "Yeah, well, I think also was not bad, cheap when you bought it, so I think. Yeah I mean.",
            "So, I'm fine with like two or three hundred Euros. But this was 1000 dollars.",
            "Okay, so I found one for 4 hundred euros.",
            "Okay, and thats at Epiphan webpage?",
            "Yeah, at epiphan.com, and go to products.",
            "Can you just paste the link paste the link to the ORGANIZATION7 doc.",
            "Sure, I can.",
            "Okay. Yeah, 400 dollars, okay. So now this is this is the thing that would be compatible with your current set up for the video, a mixing for the laptop, right?",
            "Yes. So you can also see it support both HDMI as well as VGA input. So I think its basically just the current model of what we have.",
            "Okay, okay, thats good. So we have not. We were not able to find this one. For some reason. So thats thats much better. Yes, its more expensive than than what we would have, but its okay, so we will probably order this one. And in that case,, we need to set up the software so, that yeah who can help us with this like.",
            "Yeah, so I think this should be not big issue setting everything up I mean we can have individual call with this tool to get you started. If theres anything else you need from me PERSON15 particular I think we should address this now, because I also have to run to the next appointment.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. Okay, yeah so thank you. So that seems we have the solution for the hardware, and now quick question on the pt, PERSON8 talk mentioned colleague who could help, the idea for the naopart is to have the attraction at the booth at the offline booth, so is there someone at ORGANIZATION1 who would have the time for debugging and and trying to use the nao as as speakers or microphone. Yeah simply who is contact person not that we should discuss this now, this is very optional.",
            "Robots as well. Really good system, the problem is. Okay its a bad system because normally you have robot voice. So you would really need system and we have. And so I would only if you have really good TDS system, ORGANIZATION7. And I don't know if you can use it, and I would say leave this option out. Bad TDS system.",
            "Yeah, okay, so I know that colleague of mine has worked with Nao and to one of other occasions here, and he has used ORGANIZATION7 TDS and then like its stopped working and reason was probably because he ran out of the three three minutes of of of demo use.",
            "With dis online TDS systems, so we have no offline system so our only option would to be to use an online system they havvery good quality but the problem is if you lose your internet connection or something else its a little its not so good and you make bad impression and your system is good but only because of this make a bad yeah impression and so I would say, yeah I don't would risk. If its not important I would leave it out.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah. Thank you. So now the were finally coming to the saucer components. So we have already discussed the image below ORGANIZATION1 was not here. So ORGANIZATION1, please have look for the down in the document and scroll down I'll scroll down for you now we have discussed like what the session looks like. And we now know that the recording will be, and the saving will be rather a worker and not not client from this. From the point of view of of the mediator, but thats that the little change. And I would just like to highlight here again, that we expect your ASR to work into stages as you've described previously. So first emitting words. And then the second worker consuming these words and putting them together into sentences and emmiting them as sentences, is that correct? Is it the way it would be set up. And maybe it is already set up in the ORGANIZATION1 text, yes. Yes, you are emitting text and then where is the worker for the text.",
            "Already, one below its like text to text on the first page. A first page. Yes, so the last four items are.",
            "I see, okay. Yeah text to text. So we ll connect these together and the reason is that we would like to connect our ASR preferably so with the setup we would only be producing Czech unsegmented text, and then we would reuse this is what we've discussed before the weekend, then we would ruse th pipeline from unsegmented text to text like for obviously for retraining it changing it but using your SLT ORGANIZATION1 tools, so the second worker for Czech will be the same and the first worker will have to be different if we are able to connect to this, so this is all i wanted.",
            "I mean but you have to train models of course then for Czech.",
            "Yes. Yes, we have to train models for Czech for the second part, the segmenter for MT, yeah. So this this part for Czech has to be redone with SLT ORGANIZATION1 yes. And this part wil be yeah there is still lot of work, fortunately this Czech part is not critical for the fair like their yes yes indeed there its its fair with foreign students so Czech will be spoken only very rarely there at at the presentation venue. So we mainly need English. So this is this is good were like on on the safe side. Okay, so that the set up a is it feasible. We have discussed this. Is there a correct distinguishing between clans and workers who have fixed this. The English will be worker, yes. Clients can only receive, we understand this, some streams must be connected to several component. Does it need this? Yeah. So. So yes, thats thats a general question on the mediator. So in some setups, we know that like the of the take the lets take the example of a doubly recording the same voice. So, there is the notebook that get the audio signal sends this to the mediator. And then we need this, this voice signal to be saved both to like interrupted stream. And in another a worker we need to save it per parts. My understanding is that I would set this up with the fingerprints so that I would say that the first the the client that get the audio and then sends it to the mediator produces a produces for example. It produces the input fingerprint, it it produces German hybrid, then the recording worker consumes this DE hybrid and it produces, the hybrid dash copy one. And then the ASR the ASR itself should connect to DE hybrid copy one. To do the to do the ASR job. Yeah. I'm not clear, I realize.",
            "Let me type to PERSON14.",
            "I also didnt understand your example but you are probably on the correct way, one client may run for example one output stream to the mediator but ask for two different. For example one asking for one recorded audio and one ask ASR recognition.",
            "Sorry, we lost you.",
            "You are just quiet, you are really quiet.",
            "Do you hear me? A little bit better.",
            "Yes, thats better.",
            "Okay. One client may start one output stream but ask for one or more input stream, one for example from the audio recorder worker and one asking for ASR recognition. I commited an example last week in the GitHub repo in order to explain a little bit better how to perform these usecase through AB client.",
            "Um-hum, yeah. Okay, so I think its its lets proven not go into the details in this call where everybody's present will talk to you PERSON14 later on. If we are not sure. Yeah. If if our way of setting up is the optimal. Yeah. So, that lets lets leave this for for the technical discussions. Then yes, PERSON10 is not on this call, right? Is he?",
            "No, no.",
            "Yeah, because his his help would be would be would be appreciated for the, interruptive worker that will save,, the signal to separate files. So we will have one session spending for two hours or more of the 90 seconds per, ninety second in elevator. So this will be recorded as the whole. But then we would like to have a secondary worker. And the secondary worker should just,, have,, get some input signal from elsewhere, such as a touchfile in in the directory and if touchfile exists it would open the touch file and see what file what output file name it should use for the current recording. It would would then save the coming the incoming data to this one,, recording file, then the touch file would would be deleted by the operators sitting at the at the the, the stage, and these this stopping worker or this interrupted worker will keep fitting in the pipeline. But it will no longer record into any file. And again, when touch file appears again. It would start saving the data again to, to another file. So for this for this tweak of of standard recording worker,, experience of PERSON10 or, someone else would be. Would be useful. So we'll talk to him separately, right. Yeah,. Okay? So I think yeah. Yeah, okay. Yes, I heard my voice was not always recognized but nevermind. So that yeah, there is there is some dresscode. This is something to discuss with PERSON2 and also obey what whatever she says, she says black trousers white shirt and then she is going to buy blue bowties and blue. So this is for those who are actually coming you will you will learn about this later on. So the basic machine translation support is from English into German and Czech. And hopefully, if we get Czech running as well, then from Czech into English. And from Czech into German via English. That would be maybe automatically in the in the mediator,, and the status of the empty components. So this is this is finally the place where I would like to ask my colleague PERSON6 to present I'll just give him my my headphones. To to say what is the current status, and, to how to how should we test our our machine translation with your German with your English with your English ASR. So here is here is PERSON6 now.",
            "Hello everyone, can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So, the currents current status at the moment is that,, I'm actually not able to ping the mediator to ORGANIZATION4.com. So I'm not sure whether its up or or down, maybe I've missed the the some details at the beginning, so.",
            "Okay. Let me say that it is not possible to just ping the server because ping is not available. So you have to check the connection to the port. Okay, I though it was pinging but nevermind, so good to know that its not possible to ping the server. Anyway so when there is, like, servers we can start the clients there and basically see what happens, so from what I've understand there is there will be, input coming in in English right? And does the client request the Czech translation or is is there a client or whats the setup at the moment.",
            "If you use the example client you can send English audio and request the Czech translation and then should automatically find the. Do you hear me? I cant hear anything.",
            "Everything is gone.",
            "Now its back again.",
            "Okay, sorry, I didnt hear you for a for a more than minute so. Could you repeat what you were saying?",
            "I just said that you can use the example client to send Czech audio to the mediator, workers are available. You can get English transcript, or or in requesting the transcript on the other way, you can send English audio and then you will get the translation in Czech.",
            "Okay, so. So there is an ASR for for what language for English or for for.",
            "For German connected.",
            "Okay. We will get some sample in in English and we will test it with the simple client okay. Are there any any specific requirements for the sample I mean. You know that the sampling grade or something like that.",
            "Well, 16. I will send you audio specifics by Email maybe.",
            "Okay. So, the thing is running now and we can test it whenever we want or are there any any things that we should think or to do before we start testing. Or or, yeah.",
            "Whenever.",
            "It might be nice when you are sending an mail with the with the details about the the simple setup, could also send some some example command client just to you know make it quicker.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thanks,. Pass PERSON21. Thank you and bye.",
            "Hi, so thanks for the, I was not able to listen to them unfortunately because out of headphones. So the the worker for I'll show the admin web. The SMT from English into Czech like an equivalent for the line that I have now highlighted in the in the mediator admin web is ready. But we need to test it and there could be many bugs discovered and we expect that we should connect after the line that I've highlighted now, so after the ORGANIZATION1 translation service and which produces N text is that correct? I don't hear anyone. Okay.",
            "Yes, from.",
            "So, as as PERSON21 said please send us and I don't think you have send it yet to me, I'm not sure but correct me if I'm wrong. Please send us also the sample command line to test it, so the command line that takes some audio file on sitting on our disc, works as the client to the mediator sendthe speech in an online form, like online for online processing not the batch processing and uses your ASR into unsegmented text and moves on to the ASR so moves onto the English segmented text then uses our worker to get the translation and then prints the translation. This is something which is very simple for you to write but this will be our first use of of of this pipeline so seeing the command will will save us a lot of time.",
            "Yes, no problem, I will send you the example and the audio specifics.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so we'll we'll try this and we need to try this very soon today tommorow so that if there are any problems with the worker of ours then we can them because like we expect receive individual sentences in English but there is problems here.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay thank you. So actually we will receive the example command from PERSON14 not from not from PERSON18 and from ORGANIZATION1 point of view all with service are running we should be simply able to use them and thats it. Right?",
            "Thats what we hope, as always we are not sure. But yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Here is what is this. Yes, so someone has it was probably PERSON17, it would be perhaps interesting but this is very optional, to also offers subtitles translated or not like not present them at all. But to offer them in the online web form web web webpresenter. To other languages. So there is 52 Czechs, 3 Slovaks, 19 German, like participants, 19 Italian. So whenever whenever I say company it means like 2 perhaps 3 high school students or maybe 4 I dunno. And then 13 Belgian, which is Dutch and French probably but we don't know the the separation, 7 Romanian companies, 4 Spanish companies, 3 Russian companies, 3 Bulgarian companies, and and 1 Luxembourghish company. So here is the priority of languages that people would like to read, perhaps. And we can, this is very optional, nobody expect that from expect that from us at the fair, but it will be a dry run for the for the ORGANIZATION3 setups with more target languages. So if we can add further workers for having translations. Available also in Italian, and in German, well German is there. So Italian, and French, that would be good. And then Romanian I don't think that we have that. And Spanish would be an interesting interesting thing to have.",
            "Yeah, ORGANIZATION1 can start workers for Italian, French and Spanish.",
            "Yeah, so, yeah. I'll just and that would be good and if you would start this workers how do we make the clients available. So like.",
            "Can always specify which language he wants to have and he just has to specify then that he wants to have this languages.",
            "Yeah. So, my question is what is the way of presenting these additional subtitles to the participants. So for that you have a webpage that shows this, can we see the webpage or how does it work, this webpage connects as a client to the mediator right?",
            "So I mean we havent webpage yet for ORGANIZATION4 but for our mediators we have a webpage and there you can select the session and then you can select from all available workers which language is you want to show.",
            "Yeah, so is it compatible with the current ORGANIZATION4 platform, can we also try this like debug this in in the coming days. So that we know that the presentation it is also important for for the case that we failed to have the second video mixer for the secondary stage. So I think it would be good to have this webpage running. But it has to be compatible with the current mediator, or there should be another such webpage from ORGANIZATION4. So what what is available, what can we use presenting translations.",
            "Currently we don't have the webpage, we can first. Webpage mediator. You know we have to do the presentation.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "It will be developed but not for the.",
            "Not for the fair, right, yeah. So the only option that we have for now is is to try to get the ORGANIZATION1 presentation webpage running. Do you know the details, anyone on the call, how difficult it is to to set it up even with the our mediator and what complications can we expect when moving to the ORGANIZATION4 mediator as it is, as it works now.",
            "We have to talk with PERSON8 he's managing, the thing he is on holidays, so I don't know if we can test it this week or only next week.",
            "Um-hum. And its proprietary or is there any chance that you could release this later on.",
            "I have no idea. Sorry. I have to talk with PERSON8.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. Too bad. Okay so well, this is this is i mentioned that is is highly optional. Then we'll probably ask next week but that will be only to, well that will give us only the one week. To to try running it. And fixing whatever is needed. So another, but I don't think that we will be able to like create such a client ourselves within his limited time so. Yeah, hopefully hopefully it will work, at least as a fallback. And whether we will need the workers whether we will actually be able to present the translation something collect. Would there be any chance to ask him like where, so ask PERSON8 even on holiday like where it is and if you could look at it or is that a.",
            "I mean its not that easy to setup, so you need to be, its not that we can do it half a day or so. So I guess setting up is little more complicated.",
            "In contact. Okay, so lets probably leave it as it is because for the main purpose we ne we have the the thing that we need or that will be the video mixing thing that you have and you will be bringing physically for for the main stage, so for the main thing this will work. Okay, so this is we are at the end of of this very complex list and. Everything that I wanted to ask, is there anything that you you realized that I might have forgotten or. If not I would like to double check for holidays like who else, who is now on the on the on the call is going to have holidays before the fair, anyone or? Okay, I take that everyday from now on everybody will be will be present so hopefully we would be able to get everything running. We definitly should have the, the English to Czech subtitling with our machine translation system tested this week and we should know the bugs this week so that we have the next week to to fix but we should hopefully it will work out but I'm not sure we'll we'll we'll have to see. So the sooner you you like. We should actually, it connected I'll talk to PERSON21 and we should try today to connect it to the mediator and then get the command line from PERSON14 and and and run it and we should order the Epiphan and see if its if its at all coming in in time for this. And the headsets, yes this is another important which which to buy, this is the highlighted thing, this is also something that will need time. So please ORGANIZATION1 fill this for us whatever is recommended and we'll, if you if you if you find. It has an English interface but we know that this eshop is very fast with delivery. So if you find the good, some suitable headset at ORGANIZATION8 I'm quite sure that we'll get it in time. Yes, so can someone from ORGANIZATION1 confirm that. Hello.",
            "I have lost part, I have lost part of the your speech.",
            "Okay, yeah, I said we will try to order the Epiphan, as we discussed below and we need to know from ORGANIZATION1 perhaps even ORGANIZATION4 which headphones, not not phones the microphone the headset micrphone, should we buy and then give out to the presenters, and if you if you would be so nice and look at the ORGANIZATION8.cz eshop it has also an English interface and locate some of the headsets because this is an eshop that we know very well and reliable and and it has fast delivery. So with ORGANIZATION8 I'm quite sure that we would be able to get those headphones, headsets in in time. For eshops there is a risk with with the purchase.",
            "Okay. Just a quick question from my side, I am looking for wired microhpones or wireless microphones.",
            "I think it has to be wireless, because thats it will be at the stage I don't think that, that the wired microphones would work.",
            "Okay, all right, sure just wanted to make sure and I have a look at wireless and send you some recommendations.",
            "Yeah, okay. Okay, thank you. Its everything from my point of view at this moment, so if nobody has anything to add. Thank you very much. Yeah well I'm I'm getting nervous, I hope you are not. And we'll see each other in two weeks from now, and we'll also be in touch with with resolving any other technical issues as we test the the whole setup. Okay. So thank you very much for participation, thank you bye bye.",
            "Thank you, bye.",
            "Bye bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Yeah and evaluation and latency so I know I said that we we've been thinking about that a bit. But more we've been looking at incremental SLT models and noticed there's a few different definitions of latency going about. There - And again there's different definitions on the flicker, or erasure or whatever. Yeah I just thought it was kind of useful to understand what we are doing I. I see what what you are doing is EV, I mean you got this work bench what was it called again the EV.",

So PERSON1 has implemented device beam search and the mass key, The mass key comes straight forward. Or wait is it mass key, I think, yeah. So we have the bias beam search working on Nemesis not really suitable for production, but just used the experiments with it,. And it seems, Well, the way the paper was pronounced it was little bit confusing in a terms of their evaluation, there is, there is like several different variables, if you like there are several different input variables and several different output variables and they move things around and shows a couple of settings and reported them. So we have some, So a little bit more detail on that that.",
            "And the.",
            "What is that?",

            "Yeah,, I mean it, experiments are still going on, but it does look good the BIOS beam research is quite useful just as it is. I mean, it basically, it stops the output from flickering without, I mean, it does obviously has a little bit of penalty on performance, which needs a bit more testing. Sorry, on quality which needs a bit more testing.",
            "But you know, if it is just the right value, it does prevent the flickering. The wait key we're sort of less sure about, because it ‘ s a very easy way of reducing the flicker. But you lose a bit of latency. Yeah, I was been looking at models of trying to predict, when you should wait. Which it looks a little bit like word conference model, like you act, why don't you say „well I am confident in this“ and then you just, you keep it, if you are not confident, maybe you wait until -",
            "There is more speech comes out. But in terms of the latency evaluation, i guess we are taking a sort of, we are trying to do us laboratory focused evaluation, where we just take a -",
            "Or sequence of words.",
            "Yeah, but just build a specific system and then, or evaluating in isolation, you know, because they - Yeah we consider the ASR is fixed really. The Airy Padragon evaluation was a bit strange, because they sort of conflated the stability and the latency in the sense, that they don't, they don't –. They don't count a word as being delivered, until it is actually stable. You know, so if you deliver a word and then you revise it, it is not stamped, it is not time stamped, it is delivered,. Until it is stable, so if you are a bit unstable, it messes up your latency. Where as in the Stako paper, which it seemed quite clear. It was from last year i think, no, 2018,. They first criticised the older measures of latency, which was something like, what was proposed by Esipova and Cho. In a much older paper. When I say much older, I mean 2016, which is ages ago now and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then and then they produced another –. I think it was called Average, Average something.",
            "Average Like.",
            "Yeah, I think it was Average Like.",
            "Paper called Average proportion and down on paper proposed the Average Like.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Average Liking.",
            "Average Like seemed the most sensible but - I mean - We are aware that, you know, for for PROJECT2 we sort of –. We want to think at the system level as opposed to laboratory level.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Which is something you are doing doing a lot more than we are.",
            "We are trying to. But I think I see a main difference between the way we approach things and all these papers approach things, Is that we have really ASR with time stamps in milliseconds and not words. So that ‘ s a big difference because.",
            "If wait key it's not, we are not waiting for key words, we will be waiting for milliseconds. We don't have any such system.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and SLT system. But so with this - with this evaluation, that evaluation tool, that PERSON4 is developing, I am paving my way towards the other task that we have, The word package and simultaneous translation. Or we should have hand to hand systems. And there the input is the sound and the output is already the translated text.",
            "That, that also makes this strategies,, more natural,, so -",
            "So if you train a model for wait key –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then you are waiting for key words, it can be too much time in terms of milliseconds. So I think it would be really better to,, to to plan for a system, which,, emits the translations, even if the the words are incomplete, but if there was a time delay of the output.",
            "I see what you mean. So you can have a strategy, that just, yeah, waits for key seconds or something.. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which doesn't make sense in the incremental machine translation,, or or interactive sorry interactive machine translation setup. Because when, when people say interactive machine translation, they only mean text input produced and text output,, produced word by word. Whereas SLT implies that you start from a time stamped input.",
            "Ok, well, I mean, I am thinking about time stamped input, I suppose the limitation is that, –. It's much easier to experiment with word by word input. There isn't so much time stamped in to put around there around -",
            "Yes, so, exactly. We are getting our own by recording, what came out from the ASR and then playing it back. So the, the way we do it is, that we have the pipeline, which emits various things to mediator and, and back, And we have team which timestamps the lines. So we are gathering the timestamps, the emission time stamps,, and we can put this at anywhere and obviously, we do not want to re-do all the ASR, we, we like want to replay.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The ASR from, but replay the real time.",
            "So when, when you are focusing on the, on fund presentation, which especially if it's subtitles. Then it really makes a difference,, depending on how you replace. Replay the,, the input. So you do not want to re-do the ASR, You want to save the the computing power, but you want to reply it at real time.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, we did start, I did start doing a bit of that and then I got lost down the rabbit hole of not having the correct time stamps and that that -",
            "This is something -",
            "That was a little bit detour, but that is now all fixed and sound, isn ‘ t it?",
            "So the, the time stamps, that we are getting now, still need two adjustments, because when we have a recording of a sound, Then the way we did it, was that we recorded absolute timestamps in the T commands and we started the playback of this,, of this audio file at a specific time using the ADD command,, So so all the pipeline was set up, It takes some time to to start it and then the issue an AT command to to run it with some delay or some rounded time and then you have to subtract this starting time. So - We don't have that fully automated yet, but it is our current strategy of recording that those files. And PERSON3 is collecting a nice like directory of various talks that we had here that have transcripts and we also want to do it with various TED talks for example. So you have to re-play the audio -",
            "You have to re-do the ASR, then you get the timestamps, or you can also use forced alignment,",
            "Between the correct transcript and the sound, which will give you like true transcript with timestamps and then you can re-play it. So this is some of this has been done, We have achieved some of those things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some of these are only planned so we have not -",
            "Yeah, yeah, so instead of word by word you want to know exactly, how long each word takes to say.",
            "Yeah, kind of the -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok.",
            "It is not, is not because we want to be this precise in terms of words, but it is more important to to have,, the measure of delays between words. So when people stop talking –.",
            "Yeah.",
            "You still want to finish the output. So that's the current main issue that I see in the in the ORGANIZATION6 setup. When people stop talking.",
            "Sorry. What do you mean when people stop talking?",
            "When people stop talking -",
            "Ya.",
            "Often the ASR will have emitted this word, but the segmenter, which takes the sequence of nonpunctuated words, is still waiting for some more words to add a full stop.",
            "And –. Then the second speaker comes and -",
            "Starts to talk about something completely different and these two parts get joined together in one into one sentence and that se.",
            "Wow.",
            "Sentence gets translated. So -",
            "Wow, ok, so really -",
            "This is something that definitely want to avoid.",
            "So really, the pause is a clue, that you should just put a, put a full stop there.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But there is no way to, to feed it to the current pipeline. Because the, well, the the ASR system we could, we could put a wrapper around the ASR system, which would have its time monitoring and then emit an extra full stop. Maybe that is something, PERSON3, that we should do like to -",
            "Guys, you've got, you saying you've got this ASR log, but you would like to, you better just try to figure, how to replay the log into the system.",
            "The, we have the, to replay the log that's easy, so we do this. We would have a screw, which replays the log.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "So we, we have a small but growing data set, which was serve as the test set. So that will be the regular test suit for for PROJECT2 and for, for the EUROSAI congress. Now it is focused only on the ASR, but will also edge the translations, where we can and when we, for example re-do the ASR on TED talks, then we have already the translations from the subtitles from TED talks, so then that will be the ideal set up that PERSON4 is now working on. So PERSON4, am I right that TED talks is or ORGANIZATION2, right? Which, which there, which is actually the same thing.",
            "You, you are probably muted or we can not hear you, PERSON4.",
            "I think, think his microphone is not working.",
            "Yeah the microphone is not working probably or - Yeah. But anyway, yeah, just just indicate yes or –. I think, I think we - I think we used ORGANIZATION2 or we have planned to use ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Ok, to generate the appropriate data for these measurements.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, ok, yeah.",
            "So the, our real intention. Oh, he is in now.",
            "Yeah, he is.",
            "My mine - Yeah. My mine real intention behind this SLTF is to have the measure, which is also applicable to human interpreters, so I want to see the same number.",
            "Oh, ok.",
            "Style of numbers -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Where the emission timestamps is when the interpreter has pronounced the word, And we are also trying to gather data, where there is some input speech, the correct transcript of that, interpretation, transcript of that interpretation, -",
            "And also text based translation of the original thing.",
            "Ok, ok, so that's –. Was that your interest, your interest as in ORGANIZATION7. Because as part of that doesn ‘ t it.",
            "Yes, exactly, so ORGANIZATION7 has part of that. For some years there is, there is maybe in both of that.",
            "Yeah, I don't think they took, they don't take transcription of the interpreters, is that right?",
            "But they have the recordings of the interpreters for some years.",
            "They would have the recordings, yeah.",
            "And, and then we are not quite sure if these, these were shifted in time,. So, what we would have to, like, double check or, or maybe do the evaluation with the slightly moving it around to see how the result differ. So there is some uncertainty, how delayed were the interpreters, but i would like to have the same type of measure for our systems and for interpreters. And I, I can see, that there are, be very like the style differences in, in what they do, the interpreter would have huge lag, but much better precision and obviously the, the recall is something which is dis like unclear. They can be bad on recall and they can be good on the recall so this is, -",
            "And the, and the erasure is a bit difficult to assess as well, because they do, do that probably -",
            "They don't.",
            "No, they don't?",
            "I ha noticed.",
            "Not sure, oh yeah, don't notice, ok.",
            "So could you hear me now?",
            "Yeah, sounds good.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Ok, so ok. About this ORGANIZATION7, I think I sent one email to PERSON7, has seen it? I think I sent you monday morning.",
            "I ‘ not sure. Yeah, more likely I ‘ not. Yeah.",
            "I can I -",
            "Yeah, so i am not, yes, yes that was the number of six directories, yeah. So that was about the data set, so ORGANIZATION7 is probably the, that's, that's the best setup, where we have the original speech, then the correct transcript of that.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then interpreter's recording,",
            "Not recording.",
            "Including transcript.",
            "Only the transcript. We should do the forced alignment.",
            "And we need to do forced alignment, ok, so -",
            "Exactly.",
            "But we have the sound, so we, once we have the.",
            "There are,, I can not hear, actually.",

            "I can't really understand it, PERSON4.",

            "Yeah, I will do this.",
            "Yes, so, ok, so, now try again.",
            "Is it better now?",
            "Somewhat better.",
            "Is it that, ok so. About this, about this data set, we have the source, for example in English, we have transcript of it and the translation, transcript on it, transcript. So if we want to create our ASR timestamped transcript, we can do forced alignment, because there are some needed information about the starting and ending time of each person who talks, to we can. And the time and ASR we can evaluate translation of the, the reasons, the voice of the speakers -",
            "The voice of the interpreters.",
            "The voice of the interpreters, yes.",
            "But it is not there.",
            "No, it is not there.",
            "But it, but I think this is what PERSON5 said, it should be possible to get it from separate website.",
            "Maybe inside the data there are some parallel data set there, but if you because there are some directories for each language interpreted, One speaker talks in one language and they tries to translate it to, I think other 5 languages, and the. Final data. But maybe it gets from other website, ok, I'll think -",
            "Ok, we need to, yeah, we need to talk to PERSON5 again, because I think that he has discovered that there is a certain period of the years in which -",
            "Which are also include in this Euro file ST. Where there is not only the source side audio and corrected transcript but also the recordings of the interpreters. I would not expect to have correct transcripts of the interpreters -",
            "No.",
            "But we are probably happy to do this, it is not to, like for for test TED size is not too big, it is not to.",
            "Yeah, cause it your translation, sorry.",
            "For each in there, for each language we have transcripter for interpreters, but for the audio, i couldn't find them. I don't know.",
            "Ok. So we have -",
            "We have transcripts of interpreters.",
            "But we can not, so, so for the evaluation and, but now i don't know, how to make sure that we understand, what you're saying, PERSON4, because the connection is really bad.",
            "Maybe it is, maybe it is my microphone, now it is better?",
            "Now it is better.",
            "I change it now. Ok. Ok, we have - Ok, we have the transcripts of interpreters. So for example if the source is English, for other 5 languages we have translations as it, for example, when they start each sentence, when they start and when they ends. On the similar time.",
            "So -",
            "On the similar time in event to the source language.",
            "But is it really -",
            "I sent you some files. I sent you some files.",
            "I'll have a look at those files.",
            "Ok, I mean, we have - This translation in EUROPAL understood they were not the same as the, what the interpreter said. Yeah, the translations were done after, the fact -",
            "Yes, exactly, so we have to be very careful about this. Yeah.",
            "At least they are cleaned up, I mean, I am not sure -",
            "It is -",
            "So,, yes, so the speeches, speaker speeches –. And president was and speeches - Yes, so this must not be, I am sure that this is not the interpreters, Because it is like line by line aligned.",
            "Translations, yes.",
            "This is translations on the transcript.",
            "But even transcript -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Even the transcript is quite clean, isn ‘ t it? I mean -",
            "Yeah.",
            "How close is it to a real transcript?",
            "I think it is clea, well, it is clean, but I think it is, it is –. I think it is close. We have not tried our ASR on that yet, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think the people often reach their speeches, so i would not be surprised, if they really, really if they produce correct sentences.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "You are right, I think. Though maybe in other, because there are some other directories and if it can find something exactly that time happens, maybe we can do this parallel thing, but other directories not in the -",
            "Yeah, yeah. So this is exactly what we have to do. We have to align the interpreter's sound with the intre with, and then, and then create the transcript of the interpreters. And then we will see, how much the interpreted translation differs from the written translations, because i assume -",
            "Yes.",
            "That these -",
            "That these files, that we have so far, are written translation. So the,, the only data set, where we are really going to have it very soon, will be for the purposes of audible self evaluation, will be the PROJECT3, the data from ORGANIZATION1 which wa which we collected in June, And there we have student interpreters interpreting English into Czech but these are student interpreters so there is again -",
            "Little bit problem with that. And we have the transcript of the floor and the transcript of the floor is now being corrected, manually corrected, so we have the English source,",
            "The corrected transcript, we will have, we, we, as soon as the transcript is, is finished, we will send it to translation agencies to translate it sentence by sentence, And we do already do have the interpretation by the student interpreters. And then we can compare. But this is, this is all like the, the data set particularities, but the important thing is that the tool should support this type of evaluation so -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So PERSON4, if you can now summarize, what are the expected inputs to, to your tool.",
            "So I can.",
            "I didn't hear, the microphone, do the, the magic so the microphone works.",
            "So, yeah, now microphone is working?",
            "Yeah, it's better -",
            "Ok. Oh, yes. Oh yes, we changed the microphone, sorry about that. Ok, what we have now, what i need for our system is one transcript timestamp of the source language, Something alike, for example says, for example a partial sentence, partial, partial, until it is complete. So we have the time off, for example something like window, when this part of sentence is started and when it's ended. Using this I can lose estimation on, then, for example, we expect the first second or third or until the end. Words will appear in the translation. And I did one reference for, for the translation. And the output of machine translation system, which is similar to this timestamped transcript, but it is output of the system. So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I have something rather partial, but partial completed and using this I can calculate the delay on the data.",
            "For flicker and the quality, It's crazy, because,, after that,, alignment sentence alignment, I can calculate the delay and flicker. Is it about for delay, I am using the expected time of each working ASR or, or just timestamped transcript file.",
            "So.",
            "And yeah, you have an alignment based method, is that right for computing the expected -",
            "Yeah, the reason -",
            "Expected type -",
            "To introduce the alignment the intro. So there is two types of alignments involved. One of them is the alignment of segments, because we do not assume, we do not require,, the machine translation system, which is based on the ASR output -",
            "Follow the same segmentation as the true transcript has. So there can be, there can be segmentation mismatches.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "But then the quality has to be evaluated or what, what, We have two strategies, one of the strategies is that it would be aligned segment to segment -",
            "The script that people use for this is the ORGANIZATION4 MWMR -",
            "MR, yeah. Yeah. Saw that, yeah.",
            "We rely on that as well. And another option that we consider is to have like a maybe sliding window or an adjacent windows -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of time and seeing if - So the cascade of the ASR and MT is expected to say to which words these output words link to. And so like when was the original time when this target word was uttered in the source language. Is that clear? So, there is this original speech -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Words appear in some sequence -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The ASR has a little delay and some errors and then the machine translation suffles those a lot but still -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The machine translation emits a segment at some time it can be partial -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or complete, but it emits some segment and from this we can,,, from the,,, we expect the, And the output to also say which portion of the input it connects to.",
            "Right, so you want, you want to basically to look at the output word and say, you want to try right back and say, which portion, when does this, this audio actually come out if you like -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And you have to do that using the Giza alignment.",
            "Yes, exactly, because the alignment is the Giza alignment we use it to this word alignment, for example if the verb, the term, the interpreter can say, the verb is end of sentence, we give some a space for this delay, so we don't consider the delay, if the interpreter could, because it do the word alignment also instead of this our system.",
            "Yeah, I'm not sure we get anything from your message, like this is -",
            "Yeah, it's a bit, I don't know.",
            "I ‘ sorry.",
            "Some, some is too - So this is -",
            "Sorry about that, maybe next time, ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is -",
            "Ok, next time, I mean -",
            "Use a different mic -",
            "Ok, sorry about that. I think, sorry, I have two or three microphone, but I think, maybe the kind I am using there is something it may breaks it, So could you hear me now?",
            "It is still the same.",
            "It is quite distorted, yeah, or it's, it's choppy, I don't know the right word.",
            "Ok.",
            "It is chopped.",
            "Yeah, exactly, so -",
            "Ok, maybe I will write it. I can write it here.",
            "Yeah, well, I think, let's, so -",
            "So -",
            "The question is, what, what, what should we do together and what -",
            "What should we do, well, I - Yeah, I mean, I mean - You have - I would like to understand, what you're doing. I supposed you sent me the part, that draft of the paper.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I can have a look at and I see the code is there, - I guess, what we are doing is probably a bit more limited, we are trying to do it in more, in a lab setting, when we're looking at ways of playing around with the decoder and see what effect that has. But then -",
            "But that's, that's very important as well, so I think we -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We are starting at the end and you are proceeding forward, So we would just need to link.",
            "Yeah, cause, I, I mean, I started back last year sort of trying to look at what's happening to the whole system, but there was a lot of frustrations with not knowing really how it fits together and then having problems with timestamps and so on, - So, I mean, I suppose one of the things was wondering if you –. And you said you weren't really sure about this –. Do you have insights as to what, what people actually want when they talk about latency, But you said you can't, it is difficult to separate that from the user interface which is -",
            "Yep.",
            "I mean, you can imagine these two things, this, there is one is like they want the words to come out quickly, but the other is they want things to be kind of even. So it shouldn't be like some words come out really quickly and then there is a bit of pause and then –. More words come out. Or maybe not, I am not really sure, but it's probably quite good a bit - You know, you know, You have the idea of progress bar, and if your progress bar sticks, so that's really bad because you want your progress bar to be making smooth progress.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And maybe the tests you do, do this. I am not really sure, but these are what, as you say, these are things that the user interface can do some fakery here probably, and make it look like something is happening or may.",
            "Yeah, I would –. That's, that's an.",
            "Maybe it can't, I don't know.",
            "But thats an option, but I would like to let's avoid the fakery, because there -",
            "For success for fakery, you first have to have a clear idea what you want to show, and I don't think that, that we are at that position.",
            "I, I don't really suggesting that we can't, that we should do this, but I am saying that this -",
            "This is what ORGANIZATION3 does often.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For example the smooth scrolling which, which for me makes excel values bland anymore, because I am so distracted by this scrolling so -",
            "I, I, I, I, I never use excel so I don't -",
            "Yeah, yeah. So answer, so do so don't I, so there is one more reason for that now and - So we had a call with PERSON2 today and -",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "She insisted –. Well she was happy to, to keep the older system as real time as possible. So to minimize any delays and avoid any caching in the presentation,, part which,, because we want to avoid caching. But at the same time from her experience and from Purwell's experience they say, that it is better to wait like two, three seconds and deliver a stable output, and they do it for the deaf people, because these do not know when is something being said. So then they don't realize -",
            "That there is a delay I think and this is pretty different from people, who see what is, what is being like -",
            "See also if you -",
            "Yeah, ok, so you, if you - If you listen to the audio and you are waiting for something to come up in the screen, yeah, that's, that could be annoying -",
            "That's annoying, exactly.",
            "If you can't hear the audio, then whatever - Yeah, doesn't -",
            "Then –. Yeah, and if you don't understand the language, then also the delay is good for you, It doesn't bother you, but if you do understand the source, but not quite, so you need -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Some, some kind of assistance, then this caching in your brain or uncaching, that's something, which is very hard to do -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like realizing, what I've heard a second ago in language that I don't quite speak, and, and, what I if it is, if it's - Just a second then it fits into the same time frame -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of the brain but, but if it, the delay is longer, then you can not really recover the, the meaning.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So there is very different use cases,, a.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they do not seem so different, if you first describe them, but then, if you really sit in them, then you realize, how, how different setting is. So that's why I would,, like leave the,, presentation as a totally separate topic.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And,, there's further issue is like, how much of content can you show. And this is again something that we are like discussing with -",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON2, because they have the subtitle idea and we have this experimentation that some of the systems,, some of the language pairs and given particular set of MT systems would introduce too much resets or like total, -",
            "Total rewrites.",
            "Total rewrites of these,",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Of these -",
            "Ok.",
            "Two lines. Whereas this total rewrites are not harmful, if it's, if it's rewriting the middle of a paragraph, you don't bother, you, you just like the, the stable top remains there, so you have some.",
            "Ok.",
            "Thing to rely your eyes on and you know, what has changed.",
            "Yeah, yeah, it's not realy hard to measure, wasn't it? Yeah, but that -",
            "It's, it's, well, you just have the log file, so the, I like the simplicity of the ORGANIZATION5 paper -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because they, all they have, is this event log and they record what happens when, and then -",
            "Like, I like your observation that they're conflated flicker and latency. I haven't realized that. I liked when you said that, in previous call, I didn't know where that comes from, but since they count the the word as, as if it has appeared only once it's stable, then I understand that it increases the latency.",
            "So, so - PERSON4, this is something the we should really make sure we do differently, because we have a number of different types of evaluation and at this point I am not fully sure that we have the right ones,, -",
            "Yeah, that -",
            "I mean from what?",
            "So and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "From what you're saying about the use cases, it's not really clear, what the right one is, So having lots of measures, is actually quite good but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "We have to understand what they mean.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the way I see it, is that we should finalize SLTF and actually test it on the data, which is something which has not -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah - Which is something, which has not,, has been done yet, so maybe there was like one file, so PERSON4 is testing it for bugs, but not yet testing for -",
            "Yeah.",
            "For the numbers he is emitting. And I think that,, we simply want the, now the set up, which is also the, the basis of the addable selfie task and -",
            "The basis is, that you have the sound in the source language, which is English and -",
            "You are showing timestamped MT outputs, partial and complete sentences, and each of these MT outputs is labeled with the emission time, when the user saw it -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And it's also labeled with the timestamp's start and end of the of the source audio, to which input sequence of or to which input, -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Stamp or sound it refers.",
            "But sorry, so which –. So in the task, one of the the users are given the audio, is that, just the audio, is that right? And they have to produce this MT output.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry, they'll have the audio with the timestamps, and they'll have to use the MT output which also have has timestamps or what do they have to, have to add to it?",
            "What, so they are getting as the input the audio and they are expected to produce target language text.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The minimum style of evaluation is that they simply emit one full text with no updates, just junk and without any timestamps. That will, that is the basis of the doc, it's, it's nonnative s focused on nonnative,, -",
            "Spoke language translation, so there the, the bleh score and standard things like that for the whole thing will be the core measure, but if they can –. We would - And our protocol suggest them to do it - We would really like to get the translation in parts.",
            "As many parts as they like, indicating, which of these parts are stable and which are just partial updates -",
            "And for each of such message, that comes from the MT output, the message should be labeled with the source time and end time, start time and end time, -",
            "Which span of input, this tran this output of the translation refers to. And also the emission time.",
            "Also they have to do the Giza alignment then?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok.",
            "They don't have to do the Giza alignment.",
            "No?",
            "Because they, they had, it depends on their systems, but if we are participating ourselves, which I am afraid that we could be the only participants, but anyway - If w if we participate ourselves -",
            "Will you win then?",
            "Then we have the ASR, we have this sentence segmenter, the sentence segmenter,, knows where was the first word in terms of time of the sentence, and where was the last word of the sentence, so the - B Yeah.",
            "Segmenter emits the sentence labeled with timestamps and then the machine translation just copies these timestamps.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the, the sentence gets shuffled -",
            "Yeah.",
            "There is some word or word order changes, whatever is necessary, but the claim is, that this sentence is a translation of this sound.",
            "Right, so, it's gonna be some continuous chunk of audio -",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "As converted to a sentence. Ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But they don't have to align within that.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "No, that's, that's what the evaluation does, it figured out exactly -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Within that -",
            "Yeah.",
            "What's alike, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And then there we have two options. One is based on the order alignments by Giza and another one is something,, which only uses the timestamps and like expands it, as like a border, where the words can also land and then, it it kind of assumes that the word, that the reordering was not too wild, but this is, I don't -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like that much, but PERSON4 prefers -",
            "This, which is simple.",
            "It's like a distortion limit, isn't it?",
            "Yeah, like the distortion limit at the boundaries of sentences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Could you hear me now?",
            "It's still the same, but.",
            "Because, I, ok.",
            "Yeah. That's unfortunate, it's still the same.",
            "Now? Is it better?",
            "So I think -",
            "So -",
            "So how to proceed. We'll simply proceed on our own -",
            "Yeah.",
            "With the data set preparation -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which, as i said, means to collect various a SLT systems run on audios, when we also have the correct transcript and we also have the reference translation and ideally, where we also have the reference interpretation and then -",
            "Then we can compare how the system differs in these measures compare to the, to the human interpreter -",
            "So that's the, that's the long term plan.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And long term in the sense, that we don't need the humans to,, to, we don't need the human data now, we only need for the addable selfie task, we only need the measure and the MT outputs, but not yet the comparison with humans.",
            "Microphone, is it ok now?",
            "No. So it's probably the - It could be the sound card or the connection, maybe the, the connector of the microphone or if you, or if you can switch to the built-in microphone, then maybe also better, I don't know. But that was - Actually no, it was it was bad already with the, with the with the built-in microphone. I remember that you were -",
            "I can not change the built-in microphone in this program because -",
            "So cou.",
            "Could that be I changed the font. Unfortunately I, it doesn't change in the pixie.",
            "Yeah, yeah. It could, it could it be that your machine is overloaded? That the CPU is overloaded? Is the machine warming up?",
            "Maybe it's overloaded.",
            "Yeah, so,, sss. I think that the, the best way to collaborate is, if you -",
            "Could also come up with, like some missions to the addable selfie tasks, not necessarily for the task, but just -",
            "No.",
            "The same style going from English into German and Czech -",
            "Separately, but using the incremental systems. And there we would use our measures and -",
            "We will see, how the incremental systems are better or worse in terms of the, the stability and delay,, compare to the current ORGANIZATION6 style of set up.",
            "Yeah, that could be interesting,. For the task, I assume, well, you need to produce ASR for the task -",
            "Sorry.",
            "And, and what you are saying is, that you, is that you don't have any ASR systems running?",
            "I won't, actually, we don't have one running, we should have one but we don't,.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is is the -",
            "So PERSON3 can easily, PERSON3 can easily create this ASR outputs for you -",
            "Do you have a, do you have a local company -",
            "Do you have a local company to system?",
            "Yes, PERSON3 has it.",
            "Yeah, we have about.",
            "Is that easy to get?",
            "I can send you but them find some labels and it could be. It is easy, yeah.",
            "So,, maybe -",
            "Ok.",
            "PERSON3, PERSON3, in your sound setting, isn't your microphone main set too high? Open your sound setting and try to, try to –. I think there is, there is input input volume and maybe that slider, that ‘ s too high.",
            "All these people working in spoken language translation, they aren't very good with microphones.",
            "I know why, because -",
            "We keep playing with them and and all your -",
            "Ok.",
            "Settings are changed by different peoples -",
            "No.",
            "Using the same machine, so whenever you get the machine -",
            "Ok.",
            "It's like totally misconfigured.",
            "So there's too much microphone experimentation going on -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Over there,.",
            "Ok, so I see you did -",
            "Yeah, it's probably better -",
            "PERSON3? PERSON3? Are you talking or not?",
            "If you hear me now?",
            "Yes, PERSON4 is still the same, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, it ‘ s too bad.",
            "So let yeah, I mean, the, this sounds interesting,.",
            "So the deadline is the 17th of March, which is quite early.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, we, I mean, the situation we are in is that PERSON1 was finishing, basically in in a month or four weeks really.",
            "So we're, we're trying to sort of work at such a way, that we round things off a bit -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then we're not sure what's gonna happen,.",
            "So - But, yeah, potentially, especially, we have the ASR outputs, we can run,, run them through whatever we have and see how it looks,.",
            "And these, these models, do they expect sentences as the input or do they expect a window of words? I assume -",
            "I would be -",
            "I am not the expert at punctuation, but -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we're - That's right, isn't it, yeah, that you are working with - I mean, we put in prefixes, but, yeah, it's, would be -",
            "Prefixes? Ok. So that's the ideal set up, because we, what we have is the ASR followed by a punctuation insertion and followed by something which we call online text flow events, Crazy stupid name, but it creates sentence events, so to say, so that's word events -",
            "Come from. And the,, it's always every event is one either complete sentence or -",
            "The last, the current last sentence, which is possibly incomplete -",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so we are gonna feeding, I mean, I guess it goes from the start of the sentence to at a certain point -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Prefixes, to evaluate it -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And yeah.",
            "So if you, PERSON3, if you could, if you could for all the files that we have now, and you do only English into what?",
            "What is your translation directions, PERSON8?",
            "What are you trained PERSON1? Just check.",
            "I do English to German.",
            "English to German. Ok, that's good, yeah.",
            "Yeah, yes.",
            "It's, it's only trained on,, smallish data like, what is it small speciality.",
            "To database the SRT17.",
            "So yeah, but that, just the 300000 sentence from the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, but yeah, so, so far that's what we're experimenting with -",
            "So,, so how where doesnt the stability of the search come from?",
            "The stability of the search?",
            "Yeah, if you like -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you, if you are receiving -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Extending longer and longer prefixes -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Will your outputs be stable at the beginnings or will they also flick away?",
            "Well, it depends. I mean, the, the idea, so it's always a retranslation, -",
            "So. Sorry, it's not, actually, it's not really. It's not real incremental MT, so it's re-translation -",
            "And the idea of the BIOS beam search is just. It's kind of straight forward. You have the prefix you translated last time, before you extend it, and you just add a small penalty to the -",
            "Yo.",
            "To the probability, to the score provided by the translation system, which penalizes if it moves too far away from the previous prefix -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And -",
            "So -",
            "I think -",
            "So you should get a log from us, which will contain these prefixes -",
            "Yeah.",
            "One after another, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "They will be sometimes interleafed also with the complete sentences, because, well, you will see.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hopefully you'll still be able to like recover the sequence of growing prefixes -",
            "To introduce the penalty at the right points, and essentially if you send us back the exact same number of lines as the log had -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Except that the, the, it will be translated –.",
            "Translated, yeah.",
            "This is what we -",
            "That's what ‘ s used to evaluate.",
            "This is was we use to evaluate it.",
            "Ok. That should be possible, yeah. I think.",
            "So, so, the good, the good setup for, the good thing about this is that we can very easily send it to any MT system, which will translate full sentences quite well, and these partial sentences it will probably round them off and introduce full -",
            "Stops and in that case your, your system would be, work better, - So -",
            "Yeah w yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah. I tried diversion of the system on prefixes and obviously, well, for English to German it does do better on the prefixes obviously, because it doesn't try to make full sentences.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So. I think there were, the results from English to Chinese were little different, but that's still - Yeah. I haven't figured that out yet,.",
            "So if, if tha. Well, our evaluation asset is, is like it's implemented, but it has not been tested yet, and we actually do not have sufficient different MT outputs -",
            "Tough.",
            "So having one of, one from your side would be, also, ee, helping.",
            "Ok.",
            "We can also like copy pasted to whatever system are there, and then PERSON4 can collect the numbers and we will see, how bad the situation is, because the segments don't match the reference, so the the full set up is to only focus on lower longer windows like half a minute -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or things like that. And evaluate bleh score on this half a minute -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Translated -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Text, which is easy to recover from the log file, you will only -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Call that things, collect the translations and only take the final ones and -",
            "So this is a general problem evaluating SLT, because bleh expects segmented text and that's ok, ok.",
            "So, so, PERSON3, if you simply could send all inputs that we have –. You don't need any –. You may want to, to have also the audio just for, for your reference, so if you want the audio, PERSON8, let us know -",
            "Ok.",
            "It is, it is often our own presentations and it is not too big and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. There should be the addable selfie depth set ready 11 days ago already, yeah, but I haven ‘ t put that together yet -",
            "But it's not ready.",
            "It is almost ready, but not not fully. And,, so that will be also another set of files, which have reference translations into German and Czech and source sound. And PERSON3 will provide it with the output, well, actually, do all the full log directories, so we have a log directory, which is at various steps of the pipeline. The output of the ASR, the output of the punctuation insertion and the output of the sentence caching or sentences advancing -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the output of our MT as well, that's, that's so that you can also see what our MT is is producing there -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And you would take the sentence aligned or sentence event files and you would translate that so the sentence event files have already the correct number of, of, well, some number of lines and this number of lines is preserved in machine translation.",
            "Yeah. So it's just a piece of text we translated and then, yeah.",
            "Yeah, what and some three numbers in front of that to be pasted in front of that as well -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you don't change the timestamps in the translation.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "Yeah. So, PERSON3, maybe you can directly send the, the last email, where you had this, you already had one, one such example that you sent to PERSON4 recently, So simply send it to, to PERSON8. That's one file which you can already have a look at and if anything is not clear there, then PERSON3 can explain, or PERSON4 can explain, or I can explain. And you will try translating it to German and seeing how that differs. And we also have the reference and not for this doc. So we don't have yet the reference translations in a nice way and, yeah.",
            "But we are getting there.",
            "Ok, yep, that's, it sounds reasonable.",
            "Yeah. Is there any chance that you would also train a big system, because right now you will be comparing relatively strong -",
            "Yeah.",
            "English to German system with a weak one, which has better chance of of stability, so -",
            "Yeah, I see what you mean,, yeah. I'm not sure if we can. Yeah, we, we talk about that, I'm not sure which beca. As I say like because, yeah, Yael finishes in like 4 weeks, I'm just trying to. I bring things to some conclusion, so -",
            "Yeah, so I think it would be -",
            "It's not like most things left hanging, so -",
            "It would be probably better to to train a standard system on the very same training data that you have for the smaller one, so that you have two weak systems, one -",
            "Is one with proper segmentation, one with the standard the less stable and the the more stable and -",
            "The translations that we are producing with the stronger systems would be kind of reference point.",
            "Yeah, the BIOS beam search is only run, it is a translation time, so I mean, the system is, it's a regular system and then you just change the beam search -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, it can be -",
            "So, so, one, it -",
            "So it can be run with them without BIOS beam search.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, the one is like -",
            "Defini. And there is the parameter for how strong BIOS is, -",
            "So there is truly no chance, that you would have maybe someone else to add this to PROJECT1, because our system -",
            "That's, that's unlikely, –. There is some rumour that it may get added to PROJECT1. I mean, basically, you know, ORGANIZATION3 get wind that this is useful, then it may end up in PROJECT1 any way. Hello, is everyone frozen?",
            "Hey,",
            "Maybe just PERSON7 is.",
            "Yes, because I think there is a problem in ORGANIZATION8 internet, because nothing at email is inaccessible, ORGANIZATION8 internet, I -",
            "Ou.",
            "Think there is, yes, as I see, I think -",
            "PERSON3 has come back, but PERSON7 is.",
            "Yes, cause I - Yes, even I can not open the ORGANIZATION8 email. It is hard and maybe there are some problems inside the department as I see open it.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yes, now I can see the email, yes.",
            "Maybe it come back.",
            "Yes. Ok, now I am sorry of the quality of the voice, because now I restarted everything on my computer -",
            "I, is, is a little better, I mean, I can still hear some distortion -",
            "Ok, so. Yes, yes, so the problem I, I run the email, the problem is, I think, on whatsapp, what's the problem.",
            "Aaa, yeah, I mean, maybe we should just –. Let's see, papapapapa.",
            "The problem is on my, on my computer I have microphone I don't, I can not see them, I just, I just have the default microphone on my computer.",
            "I,, yeah, it still sounds a bit distorted. I wonder maybe we should, if, if PERSON7 is not coming back, Maybe we leave the call just now, I can add some notes about the last question into the ORGANIZATION5 document.",
            "Yes, PERSON7 is coming, but now, no he is frozen, yes.",
            "Yeah, he's frozen.",
            "Yes, I think, what is in the ORGANIZATION8 internet because our website, ORGANIZATION8 internet has problem also, now I am not there, I am not in Czech Republic yet.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Now I came back to LOCATION1 and yes, the problem is -",
            "Yeah, yeah. And PERSON3 is silent.",
            "PERSON3, do you hear us?",
            "Right, I think, I think, we should, we should leave it just now, cause it's not, I am not -",
            "Ok.",
            "Hearing people, I can't hear PERSON3, actually. Let me make a couple of notes on the ORGANIZATION5 doc and -",
            "Oh, oh, wa. It is a matter of PERSON4.",
            "Can you hear me? It is PERSON3.",
            "I can hear you now, yeah.",
            "Ok, yes, I was saying there are some tests, testing going on, guys are, IT guys are doing some test thats why we went out of connection, so maybe PERSON7 needs -",
            "Ok, I got a, I got a mail from PERSON7, so, yeah, ok, so, he add summarizes, ok, maybe we just leave that now and I will write some notes to ORGANIZATION5 doc.",
            "Yeah, exactly. And I propose PERSON4 to write to what he meant to say in the ORGANIZATION5 doc and later on if you proposes to explain.",
            "Ok.",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "Ok. Alright.",
            "And -",
            "Thank you everyone. Oh, sorry.",

            "Yeah, I mean, if you have the English text, we can run that through, translate that -",
            "No, no, no, I am asking, so actually I have the audio and I have the system to transcribe the those audio, so do you want those, the directory or the Giza ASR system to run on your system?",
            "Yes, we would like that, but it's not –. I mean, yes, at some point, yeah, we would like that,.",
            "Alright, ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I didn't,, I just, I'm gonna send you the file, which on the side have the timestamp and MT output and outputs in the different stages of file, alright.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the, that's all from me.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "Alright.",
            "Ok, so I think, there is problem, so we can say goodbye now.",

            "Ok. Sorry.",
            "Ok.",
            "I have bad luck today. Ok, so have a good evening and sorry about these problems happened from my side and just, and I promise one -",
            "I think it is clear now after -",
            "I think if it's clear, do you want to, do you want this more information about the segmentation? We have to of segmentation, first ideas is using time and ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Ok, your audio, your audio is going again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe later, later I will, I will more information from me.",

            "Hello. I can hear you.",
            "OK great. That's good. And we have PERSON14. So PERSON14, let's test your connection first. That's PERSON8, right? So PERSON14, can you hear us? Does it work for you? Yeah, so we have also PERSON3. Yeah. Hi, I can hear someone. Was that PERSON14? Hello, Hi everyone.",
            "Yeah, so now it works. Okay. Great, perfect. How yeah. So, PERSON14, are you also looking and the document, where we are all looking at, the PROJECT1 Surge organization.",
            "Yes. I see.",
            "Yeah, yeah. It's good if, it's good if people are signed in, but it is not required to to Gmail, because then you are not anonymous bats, iguanas sheep and dragons or or tigers. But instead you're a real people. But it's it's more for the revision history, actually, but it is In any case, it's it's-The most important thing is that you add things to the document. Ok. So the connection to ean seems to work today. Let's hope it will work regularly. Every Tuesday. So welcome on board. And this is also for other, at least, get to know your voice. And we have just the 30 minutes or 28 minutes, actually, to go through things that we have done. So I would really like these meetings to be speedy, and also to get nice nice minutes from those. So whoever is like listening, please volunteer and edit the document to to take note of what the speaker is is just saying at the moment. So there, someone could have edit for me that I have invited PERSON14. That's just an example. It is not not important. Okay, so now, thanks for joining. And let's quickly go over the the updates., I have, I'm not finished with my updates yet. But actually, I'm always lost in what I have done. So it is that is I believe that you are probably equally lost in what you have done. So that is why we have these meeting, so that everybody is aware of of the progress. So I'm mainly supervising the creation of the PROJECT1 test set and the edible SLT test set. And the main thing that I wanted to say today is that the set of tools that we have at hand is nicely growing. I need thanks to several people of from, several people from you. So if anybody is processing any audio, and we have PERSON11 here, right? No, PERSON11 is gone. Where is PERSON11? So I will, I will have a separate call with PERSON11, anyway. So I'll tell him. So when when anybody has long audio file then and existing transcript. Then there is a tool, ELAN, which can easily, which can be used to easily segment this long audio into sentence long units. Then there is the forced alignment, which can be used to identify words in that for Czech and English. And these this word level alignment can be validated by showing it as karaoke style subtitles. So the, it's colour coded which words are just being uttered. And then also this is, there is another conversion script, which creates the files for SLT evaluation. And if the fai forced alignment fails, then there, the ELAN tool can be used even for manual segmentation at the word level. So for manual identification of where the words are. So this is what what now need to be like, put to put to use for the PROJECT1 test set preparation. And then another set of tools is very slowly growing for the text level processing, so,, I have,, like, refined bin based editor of tool 3 or 4 files in multiparallel corpus. Multi parallel test set. So this should be used regularly when our test set, test sets. And also a simple preprocessing for-Yeah, so this this this is where I would really appreciate if someone was was taking note, because I cannot speak and write at the same time. So, simple script that runs sentence segmentation. With some errors, and then sentence alignment again with some errors for pairs of files., so this sentence segmentation and together are deeply processing, which is needed before you start refining the, the test set. So this is, yeah. This, these tools are necessary for any evaluation. Okay. So that's, that's what I've realized now. Maybe I'll realize more things that I've worked on. But let's move to PERSON3, so that we don't spend all time on me.",
            "Hi guys. So lately, I was working on setting up client audio visualization. And now it's pretty working.",
            "Yeah, so can we test it, can we see it in any of our like Monday test sessions?",
            "Yeah, but I I, you will actually so, that visualization would be on anyone live screen. In my browser.",
            "Oh, so it's web based, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And is this, yeah. Is that, that's that's an option, but I think it, it will be s-It can be more convenient if it would run also in simple like separate windows or or window, like attached board.",
            "Yes, so-Yes, if I can interrupt, yeah, so the visualizer for the for the ORGANIZATION7 can can run on.",
            "Anywhere.",
            "Yeah, it is web based but but it doesn't really matter because you can just-There is a server which streams it and the web client, so.",
            "Ok.",
            "So if you want you can, you can, you can like stream it to multiple client at once or you can do whatever you want with with the data.",
            "Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so the the main reason why I think we needed this is exactly for a live sessions when we need to set up all the, all the processing pipeline. And this is to validate the source channels. So the one who is operating the system, should be able to to check if all the sources, in a ORGANIZATION8 environment, are there at at the right like volume. And that's that's what the visualizer is for. So ideally, our cruise control set ups should include this and spawn it as processes on the main machine, which operates the whole pipeline. And we would immediately see if something is working or or not. So that's the, that's the idea. So, yeah, so PERSON3 I didn't really want to interrupt you, but let, I did. So you work on for mock conference. Transcript generation, and you're playing with, yeah yeah, workshop. And also, I would like to add one more like a to do item. To clean up the the set up. So that we have, so we have now multiple folders in cruise control set up. And I would really like to have one, release of of that. So to say, in like engineering style. And that release would be a set up which illustrates Czechs ASR into other thing, English ASR into all the things. Maybe even French ASR and it should have all the bells and whistles that we have so far. So it should have the joints standard locks. It should have the online visualization of input channels., if if we already have ORGANIZATION8 set up. There will probably that's should rather be like separate one, so that it is not a cluttered if you go for a particle set up. But these should be like the, you should have now version. So so creative version kind of, obvious it should still if on the same place, but it needs to be polished. And all the bells and whistles merged across the various there is. So it should automatically create the transcripts with segment-level timestamps, and or even more level timestamps, so the the lock files that SLT then digest so all this nicely wrapped. So this is, this is what I would like to, to work on, in addition to to what you are working now on now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I think everything.I was wondering if because I feel like I'm quite free these days so, I I will do it more task because and I feel depressed.",
            "Oh yes, I have the same thing actually. And also realize the same thing with my kids. They have started receiving less work, like these last two weeks than the three weeks before, and it it is much worse for them, because they are like doing crazy things instead of doing something useful. So yes, exactly. So there, the one thing that would be very good would be, the segmenter, and also, maybe help the students of mine. I have two students. Suni is one of them, and then another Czech student, but he was also very passive so far, because he was busy with other school duties. Who should work on the segmentation including phoneme representation? So they could probably, who benefit from some like supervision, especially like I'm offering that regularly, but they are not asking much and also I'm overloaded. So if I could like ask you to help them, that would be a better version of the of the segmenter. Or you can work on a separately on on the segmenter on your own. But there are many bugs and and the segmenter is is now the critical point.",
            "Yeah. So like could the segmenter, segmentation in in.",
            "Yeah, so let's let's leave that like outside of this call because.",
            "Ok ok.",
            "So I'll I'll send you what I sent to them and then you can ask for more.",
            "Yeah yeah, ok.",
            "So so then the polishing, the polishing of all the set ups. So that it is easy to to launch. And most importantly, so that it is easy to diagnose what is wrong. So we are now, there is no, no Monday sessions now, but there is, for example, this particle called, this very call can serve again as a test case. And I've seen in one of the last calls that like just for fun. I I did the Czech ASR into many languages. For call I had with the colleagues of mine. And there I saw again how bad the segmentor is. On the ORGANIZATION5 seminar I realized that one overloaded machine can kill the whole show. And it took us 20 minutes to find it out. So that's something which is very bad.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So these.",
            "I knew it. Much sooner than we than the 20 minutes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but but then I was not able to like receive that message. And also I didn't know what to do. Like it's this happens easily when the main operator which was me, is not skilled enough and when the main operator is like overloaded and there is no was to come to the person physically, and like knock on his shoulder and say, \"Hey, you should look at this window, because PERSON6 is telling you what to do.\" So, yeah, yeah. So this, it's it's part of that is like communication issue. Another problem is that we do not have the diagnosis tools. So how did you know, PERSON6 that that was the problem?",
            "Because I remember that PERSON3 add the bug few months ago. And and we and we check it and found it, and but he but he forgot to run it to prevent this bug again.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So.",
            "You are talking to me? the ASR with more number of source.",
            "Yes. To be the only process which is running on the machine on which are running.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. But that, ok. So there is, there is some like configuration bug, how do we ensure that we avoid these? I don't think it is possible. So one thing is obviously to use the issue tracker. Let's use the issue tracker in GitHub for cruise control. That's what it's for. And I believe that's probably also recorded as an issue. Or could be very likely. And there is surely an issue recorded for the subtitler. So.",
            "But I thinks there should be one simple script which runs the PERSON7 ASR on our cluster in the correct way.",
            "Yes.",
            "Right now, we don't have it. So PERSON3 must do it some with several steps and ensured manually.",
            "Yes. So PERSON3 this is another thing that you should you should do. So maybe start proper like'Bugzilla 'issue tracker, but this even for yourself, into the issues in GitHub for cruise control. The polishing should be there as well, and get to get used to this standard programmers daily routine of like checking the the list of issues and ticking the them off. Obviously, you do not need to do any requests. We we do not do a coder use. But it could we could even do that, if that is if if we would have more time for that. But I do not think we have any one to review that. PERSON6 should be working on on the research, and I'm too busy to provide any sensible reviews myself. But let's use the the issue tracker. So and and it's, yeah. I know that this requires a change of the mindset. And I'm unable to do this mindset, I'm always like avoiding this this daily routine. So PERSON3 if you have similar problems, as I have with with that,, then, say so, and we will like try to make it more interesting, or trying to find way how to how to go around it. But it's it's the same thing, the polishing of the pipeline, so that everything is easy. Everything is as small as short as possible. And everything is tested, and everything is run like, there is diagnosis for everything. So the the diagnosis is totally critical. And I still do not know what to do when I like run the preparatory script, I see that giant pipeline. And then I run it. And after a minute or two. It says error. So there, I do not really know how to quickly like shorten the pipeline. And test which part is has failed. And which part is is OK. And this error can be any worker anywhere. So I have to go into the log there, see which of the log files is the shortest one, which is an indication that this one is probably failed. Then there is often many of those in the log there I no longer see the hierarchy of the of the commands. So clearly it is numbered, but it is still, for example, all the rainbow systems are like at the same level. So it's it's very difficult to-Still what I would really like to see, and that's just a vision, would be this uniques command printed again. And one line colored in red, indicating like this one killed the whole thing. I don't know how to do that. But it's, this is what I would like to have. Ok, yeah. Thanks. So that's, that's good. Let's log there for, yeah. So if you have any questions, like where is the path for dry run workshop, please make it a comment, Google comment, to someone who knows it. So this log there for the dry, the dry run workshop. PERSON13 has talked about it, we need to ask PERSON13 and PERSON9, actually as well, I I think. Or or you are the one who who recorded it, right? So you should know as well. So what do we mean by dry run workshop?",
            "The last dry run workshop which online.",
            "The online? Ok. So that I don't know. Yes, so we need to ask PERSON9. PERSON16, yes, PERSON16. Yeah, PERSON16 recorded it. And he said it's on his machine. Yeah, so let's ask PERSON16. Thank you. So where is the path. Yeah, so.",
            "So in the last e-mail concerning this ASR transcription I replied to PERSON16.",
            "Yeah, I actually make a comment here, in in the Google doc. Ok, thank you. So then, PERSON13 is not here. Let's quickly move forward. So so I'm supervising him and PERSON13 should be in close touch also with PERSON11, hopefully. And PERSON11 is here, so PERSON11?",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "So please summarize what what you have work on.",
            "Okay, I have prepared 21 languages test set. Which is I have upload there 6 languages on the GitHub. And remaining will be uploaded very soon. Because I have been some data. So most probably. And all these data are extracted from the court of European. Yes. And from ORGANIZATION9. So.",
            "Yes. Yeah, so please put them into subdirectories of of these names. And include the read me with the original link. So that we, not necessarily for each of the files, you can do that as well, but at least for the Web site, so that we know where it comes from roughly, and that immediately tells us the domain and so on.",
            "Sure -",
            "Because so the PROJECT1 test set will include domains of computational linguistics, and auditing. And we need to immediately see, which is which.",
            "Okay, I will up, update.",
            "Thank you. And also provided transcription of workshop. What do you-Sorry that's that's PERSON13. Yeah, so several languages uploaded, yeah. So and I would like to check the status of annotators. So how many are you in touch with, how many have even in the last 2 weeks actually. How many have asked the question. How many are waiting for what. Or how many are waiting for us, or how many are we waiting for? So I would like you to have a an overview of this. So do you have an idea.",
            "No, not yet.",
            "Yeah, so please, please make sure.",
            "Ok, I will discuss with you in the evening.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah, but please please make sure to to have some overview because this is, everybody can could in principle make use of these annotators, similar PERSON13 has access to to annotators.",
            "Ok.",
            "So if we spot some strange language document that could be useful. You are the person to to contact, and you will then know who you could contact to get it done. And with each of the annotators. You are the person to supervise the the process. And you were, you had something technical issues see in the document, I highlighted the tools that you should be aware of. Because these tools are useful for the annotators, depending on what type of resource they find. If they find audio, they will needs these ELAN scripts, ELANs and scripts and then if they are Linux skilled they should use the editor and we have this simple pre-processing for sentence segmentation. Plus sentence alignment. This was by me. You know about it already. And you have maybe your own pipeline, which could be even better than mine. But well. If, so feel free to improve mine. My, my set up there.",
            "Ok, I will check.",
            "Yeah, so we need to stream line this. So we need to to be very quick, if some person random person says \"I have a Kazakh, I I speak Kazakh, I have a test set which could be of interest for you file, which could be of interest of you. Then, on that day, ideally, he should receive it pre-processed by us. And in in 5 days or a week from that. We should be asking him, have you succeeded in in polishing it. And we should process in and include it in the in the repository.",
            "Ok.",
            "So this is really be quick and with little afford, little manual afford, on your side for every single person. So you need to automate thing for yourself.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you.",
            "Ok, thank you.",
            "Let's quickly move to PERSON6, because we still have PERSON10. Yeah. So PERSON6, are you still here?",
            "Yes. Can you hear me?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I evaluated the 2 new ASR workers. For edible SLT. And I found out that they are not much better than before. Nice multitude format and implement the MT wrapper and online text for events and so on.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Sorry. For these ASR workers, were any of them offline? Or all were online?",
            "Both are online.",
            "Yeah, and and PERSON5 unfortunately, indicated that there is no improve, like he he cannot run any offline systems that would have any chance to be better right?",
            "No.",
            "So at this point, we are stuck with with the ASR that we have from ORGANIZATION1 and which is pretty bad. I've asked PERSON4 and PERSON4 is starting to train his implementation the the just per or set up for English. And PERSON8 is also hopefully trying to train another PROJECT6 based ASR. So we could have our own ASRs.",
            "Ok.",
            "You've been trying English ASR?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Ok.",
            "And for these tests, this is for edible SLT share task. I've kind of given up on the online aspect. So, I do not know, well actually both of them. I think that both PERSON4 and PERSON8 will only have like transcripts, without time stamps. But that's fine. Let's let's focus on the on the ASR quality, which is the first criterion of the shared task anyway.",
            "I can decode also the time steps, if it's.",
            "Ok, yes, that would be useful. So that would be So ideally, we need, so talk to talk to either PERSON15 or PERSON14 in person but that would be slow probably, because the communication to is often. And or have a look at the edible SLT share task, I'll send you the link. Ideally, we need time stamps for when the word was uttered that's source as, like start and end. And we also need the third timestamps, timestamp which indicated when that was recognized. So the ASR system can be run with a special T script. Or T tool at the end. And this T emits the standard output and adds timestamps as well. So this is the way, or talk to PERSON3. This is the way that we record how fast the the recognition is delivered. And it is, it is OK for the shared ask to like have the integration fake. So you run it separately, you will recall your speed. And then we will say that there is absolutely zero processing time to pass it to the MT, and the MT will again add its time. And even if we do not have any timing. That's good. Let let's go for just the recognition and translation. Someone's writing that. Excellent. Thank you. Yeah, okay. So sorry PERSON6 for for the interruption, but this was exactly one of the good points that we have the meeting. So that all of you know about each other now.",
            "Yes. And I'm going to reformat the MT wrapper and online text events and so on. The point is to have the brief format of online text flow. Because right now many sentences are being repeated. And it's and it's difficult to analyze them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And after I will do it, then I can easily implement the scripts for Flicker and delay evaluations. Cause right now, I have some bugs there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Is that current of main text flow is stabile and stabile to use.",
            "Yes, yes. And I have I've fixed the bug with the installation.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, great. Yeah, great. Thank you. So how many people have here who have not spoken. We have PERSON14. But I'm not sure if that connection will work, and we have PERSON8, and PERSON10, right? So maybe, PERSON8, if you have something more to say, so that, with to start.",
            "Yeah, so we just do quickly right up. I I've been running some experiments. For my diploma thesis about the Czech ASR. I've done like domain word classification and accuracy, so I have several adaptation techniques and I'm computing how many of the domain words that identify are recognized by each of these adaptation levels. And then since like two days ago, I have been working on training the PROJECT6 co ORGANIZATION4 common voice English ASR. As we already discussed briefly. So right now it's on like sixteeth iteration of five hundred. And it's running on like 6 GPUs. So I think should be done like tomorrow afternoon. I guess. So.",
            "And is it just, is it just common voice or is it something else as well?",
            "No, this just just data from common voice just 300 hours. Just, it just like vanilla set up so because I, from what I understand, there is quite like time pressure on.",
            "Yes, that's true. Yeah, yeah. So it's good to have, it's good to try this one. But PERSON4 was also telling me that this common voice contains a many, a many utterances, but of the same sentences. So it's that many people read the same sentences. And that in your case that should not be that of big of a problem, because you do is for the acoustics, right. So the the fact that the vocabulary is limited is not to too critical. If you then use a large language model right? Or no?",
            "Yeah, well. Yeah, then I just now, I use the baseline language model, which is train only on the transcripts. So there this issue would arise. But I I plan to train a separate like larger language model and also create a larger lexicon. So that the model capacity increases this way.",
            "Yeah. The, yeah, that's very important, because the vocabulary is very small. Or the number of sentences of common call is is very limit, very small because it's it's repeated sentences.",
            "It would also be, maybe I quite helpful if the language model would be trained on the similar text as the MT model. So then maybe I can coordinated this PERSON6 and.",
            "Yes, yeah yeah. Definitely. So, so you should you should include everything. Everything that you you can. So common common voice, and also maybe just the huge English text, the size for example. The English side of two point zero. But, that will make it actually, double check the edible SLT test set. Double SLT test webpage. Because that indicates which corpora are like license, or are ok for for the constrained run. And it is OK to go beyond that. But if we are already limiting ourselves, it is more important to limit ourselves to, to what is the allowed for the common, for the constraint wreck.",
            "Ok, yeah.",
            "So I'll I'll tell you or ask me again. So search for edible SLT non-native task.",
            "And maybe one last comment, there is if, if we are not running in online set up, then there is quite interesting feature from PROJECT6, that I can predict after each word, I can predict a silence token. And its duration and if the duration is longer than some threshold than it's very good indication that there is end of sentence. So this can really help with segmentation. Like the punctionation of the output. So maybe I can also pass this information to PERSON3 or and it can be I think very useful to the segmenter model.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, ok so that's all I think from me.",
            "Ok, thank you.",
            "I I would like to make a comment on. I have a vision of what the Czech ASR. So the very end, it would be good to have the segmentor integrated with the Czech ASR, like the once you. Possible?",
            "Well this is like kind of adding an acoustic information to the segmentor. Because, yeah it predicts the silence after each word. And sometimes the duration of the silence is just zero. But sometimes it's like quite I don't know 20 milliseconds, or something, which is usually a big indication, that there is like end of sentence or at least a coma. So this could, like a kind of be like build in segmentation of the output. But I think there is still like some NLP needed to be done like it's it's not definitely not like it does not solve the task, but it can help quite a lot I think the segmentor. But I, yeah, I haven't played too much with it, because I just recently like discover it and so, maybe I will have more info in like couple weeks.",
            "Ok. Thank you.",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you. So we are already running late. Let's, let's try to be as quick as possible. PERSON10.",
            "Yes, so I haven't done very much this week. I have just finished the evaluating of my models. And so I I can confirm that.",
            "Is that 36 to 36?",
            "It's actually 42.",
            "42 to 42, yeah.",
            "Which is, it's working. So the scores are a bit lower than PERSON6's scores for the IWSLT test set. But only marginally lower, so so there is the benefit that that you have one model for all these languages. So, so perhaps. Yes, so at the moment I don't have anything to add so maybe maybe you could tell me like what to do next. Or or if we want to what do we want to do with it.",
            "Yeah, so. It's integrated, like in the sense that we can really use it in the in the daily tests of the whole set up?",
            "Yeah, so I'm not sure about it. So how does it work in their repo? Does, does it work like Should I integrated into the.",
            "You should. That's not not, that is not needed. What is needed is that PERSON3 knows how to run it, and he codes it into the scripts into the set up scripts. So part of the tools are running, and we cannot run them ourselves at all, such as the ORGANIZATION2 systems, and we still use them in the pipeline. But for the tools that we know how to start. We really should have like launchers or even installators and launchers within the cruise control repository. This is true for the PROJECT6 set up. But it is not true for the PERSON7 set up and our, at our machines. This is one thing that PERSON3 should add. And we also need that for your model. And we probably do not have it for for the PROJECT2 model, right PERSON6? When you when you run the PROJECT2 workers on our side.",
            "In cruise control there are scripts which run the worker on the coster.",
            "Ok, yes so this is, this is what what needs to be there. I don't know where these scripts are in cruise control, but yeah.",
            "Today installation and move PROJECT2 and to do models.",
            "Yes, yes. So this is exactly what-So please put the path fo how it is done. For PROJECT2. To, here to the document, so that PERSON10 knows what to mimic with the with the - is it still PROJECT5?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. Because I I I've realized that PROJECT5, or someone told me that PROJECT5 is kind of discontinued.",
            "But we have, we have connected PROJECT5 model to mediator. The models.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, I have just discovered that they have they have just discontinued PROJECT5.",
            "Yeah, but that's not a problem. Let's let's live with that. Yes. Yeah, so so please integrate it so that it becomes an option and, so that we actually can really provide all the target languages, all the 42 languages with the subtitles, because that again will create the rainbow messages, much more verbous. And we need to test the pipeline with this level of of vol like volume. So all the-We should really increase the set of cover languages, so that any Monday seminar, or even a Czech ORGANIZATION5 call could have subtitles in Kazakh or whatever we have.",
            "Hmm-hmm.",
            "So this, this is for you and PERSON3 to to discuss. Right?",
            "Yeah and maybe maybe also, I would like to add that, that I still have the TPU computational capacity. So if PERSON8 needs some some help in in making the the ASR train faster, then maybe I could, I could help. So maybe.",
            "That's the, maybe not PERSON8 but PERSON4. Because PERSON4 is also like he is still doing experiments for his. So he doesn't want to focus too much on on this. And also he knows that like his He has some English system th systems trained, but his are more GPU hungry. It is N to N neural approach. Where is the PERSON8 set up is only, the does the hybrid approach. So it would more help PERSON4. So if you if you have the e-mail of PERSON4, then please contact him directly.",
            "I'm not sure, could you, could someone send it to me?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or I'll do. Yeah, great. Yeah, great, thank you. So I'm happy that people are taking notes. And also, PERSON10, you maybe getting some tasks from PROJECT3. So will see. So please, like balance it and let us know how you're doing the sum-This will be mainly by PERSON1, I I guess. Ok. And then we still I I still wanted to mention something. And I forgot what was that. Yes, your models, PERSON10. Your models are also needed by PERSON11. So PERSON11 are you still online? PERSON11, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So, so you need to use these models for the back translation. So we need to gather all the monolingual data, in all the 42 languages. And these should be translated to English with the models by PERSON10. And that is what the TPU units, TPU units should be also useful for. Because it should be really large data. You should get large Romania, large Serbian monolingual data. Any anything at all. And this should be back translated into English.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the the sooner you have anything, and the sooner you stream line this again. So that it's easy for for you to to ship it to to PERSON10. Well, both of you are on the same disk. So you just agree where where to put it on the ORGANIZATION6 disc, then, then just the better. So we This should, please PERSON11 create like a directory of back translated text or monotext with back translation. And you should PERSON11, you should populate it. And PERSON10 is populated with the translations.",
            "Ok, I will do it.",
            "Yeah, ok, that's what I wanted. Thank you. And we have 3 minutes or less for PERSON14, so beware the call will be suddenly interrupted. At any point but if PERSON14 can still hear us, then let's use these few minutes to to quickly hear of... about what PERSON14 is working on. If that works. Yeah, so that's the the connection to if often often unstable like it, it seems connected, but.",
            "Oh so PERSON12, could you comment the path where I should conference which I interpreted.",
            "This, well, anywhere, I don't have any place for that, so where should we put it..",
            "So what think I have to do is that I have to manually solve the audio according to the language, because if that. So, it was terrible. And because I, that's why I ASRs, because..."

            "Now and I'll share my screen to show you the the ORGANIZATION7 document, for while, sharing. Yes. So this is this is the ORGANIZATION7 doc, this is the agenda, hopefully, you all are looking in it. And and, since I have ORGANIZATION4 and also ORGANIZATION3, I would like to remind everyone, that we need to provide ORGANIZATION2 with the details of the technical set up, so description of cables that like will be connecting to, together with the graphical map, how to be connected to the interpretation booth. And, this is, this is still something for the very far future for the May,, 2020., but ORGANIZATION2 is already doing the preparations. And this description is necessary because this is what they will,, be giving to the companies to translation., an interpreter agencies,, so that they know what what to connect to. So ORGANIZATION2 is seeking for the technical description, that their other, like subcontracted companies will will connect to. So please, please do provide this as soon as possible to to PERSON9. So that PERSON9 can share it with ORGANIZATION2, And and ORGANIZATION2 can, can use it in their preparations. So. Can ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION3 please confirm that they will provide the details. And the graphical map like what needs to be where, some first draft of this obviously. But this is important so that the technical negotiations can start, please confirm that you will provide this, you have the details the detail questionnaire in your email already for some weeks. Maybe we haven't heard some. To when do you need that layers? The description?",
            "And I think as soon I can hear myself and now in in the code that the little bit confusing,, but I know that for the May 2020 event, they are preparing everything with very big like time very had a lot of a lot of time in advance, like two way to advance I would say. So for the workshop that we are also preparing for that event, they want to have a schedule of the workshop like a detailed plan till the end of this week actually, and that's for workshop, which will happen in May 2020. And this is for the workshop to like be accepted to the to the congress. And for these technical preparations. I think they will already start negotiating with the possible translation agencies or interpreter agencies, and they want to include this description into this call, because they need to do the official call for tendors and the the soon that they get the detail the the better I would say. So, please, please do it till the end Okay. Yes, okay,",
            "Yeah, ok, thank you., then another thing I would just like to be sure that it will be PERSON3 will be coming for the Fair in March. I mentioned this in my previous email and this is just so that we know it's a good hotel in reasonable distance to the, to the. Yes still taking here who is coming that somebody from PERSON12 you will come, it's better, not completely PERSON3 or somebody else.",
            "Yeah, okay, So then remember to remember to tell, and, coordinate the hotel with her. So she can assist you with finding a good hotel, or or whatever, yeah. And then for the management questions. I would like to know what are the technical differences between the ORGANIZATION3 platform as PERSON5 saw it when he was in ORGANIZATION3., and the ORGANIZATION4 platform, which will be used for most of the events of of the PROJECT1 project. So I would like to thank ORGANIZATION4 for describing their,, their platform from the like API point of you. So we have access to the code. And the big question is now whether, this is the same API that we need to connect to, if we want to use the ORGANIZATION3 platform and them all for the March event. So I don't know if it is ORGANIZATION3. So, from ORGANIZATION3 it should be the same platform the only thing is we should do some testing if it's really, but from the point of view. It should be exactly the same platform. We just since we haven't connected our ORGANIZATION3 workers to ORGANIZATION4 since the last project. We have to make sure that it is still running, but we assume that it is exactly the same.",
            "So just to clarify. You may be answering the the converse question. So for the long term, we definitely want to use the ORGANIZATION4 platform and connect ORGANIZATION3 tools to that, and also our tools to that, and and all that, but for the very short term very near event in March. I think that it is easier to use the final presentation platform like the, the the the video mixer and all this from ORGANIZATION3. And my question is then whether this platform that run demo that PERSON5 saw in ORGANIZATION3 was the the ORGANIZATION4 platform, or whether it is some different ORGANIZATION3 platform. So in other words. If we use the ORGANIZATION4 connectors and connect and wrap our machine translation with these connectors, will we be able to use them in March with the ORGANIZATION3 final presentation in the video mixer?",
            "Well, do you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, the EPI are the same as the the one used in the PROJECT2 project. Then in my opinion it would be the same.",
            "Okay, yes. I'll try. Yes, that's true. The only thing I say that we have to make one final test if it really works, but it should all be exactly the same. So that shouldn't. You should be able to connect the same way to ORGANIZATION3, or to ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Okay, yes. That's very good. So, we will now review the the details of this and will coach the connector, so that we can, use our machine translation with this sample connector,. And will also work on the ASR and for the ASR we have two options, it seems that, with our experience from colleagues, who have left the department, but not have LOCATION1. We could get Kaldi models, running in and operational for March. But for those we would also needs to ride the connector. If we are able to, to finish what PERSON5 has started in ORGANIZATION3, and if we are able to train PERSON7 ASR then obviously you have the connectors ready. Would you have any comment on what would be the preferred thing for March? So I don't hear any any comment. So it probably depends simply on us. So we'll, we'll start with connecting the machine translation., and if we like, if it's it's easy to use this connector. Then we will also consider doing the Kaldi ASR, but I still for the March enterprise, I still hope more for the PERSON7 training for OTHER5 ASR, okay, and now, the thing that I call it full replica, and PERSON7 has call it like a final final check or one last quick check. We would really like to, to have the system running way sooner than than March comes., and that is so that we can test, how our MT like behaves, whether we need to finetune some times out or whatever,, so that it it behaves reasonably for that. And we also need to, use this set up to get, to to train the the assistant that we will have fo will have for the fair, so if you remember the fair is organized by high school students for high school students. and one of the high school students, we we know his name, we have met him, will be there to to help us in in running all that, obviously not the technical things about the, the ASR and its translation, but only like the set up the physical set up and also, we have the extra competition plant that every participant whose speech will be recorded, and and translated will also transcribed their own speech, and we will evaluate the clarity of their speech through standard ASR measures. So we need to like finalize the set up in which will be recording, what they are saying. Showing the subtitles. And also,,, have access to the, to the recording, so that they can do the transcription. And and As as last reason we would like to have a backup system running in case of some network issues or or whatever. So my question is whether a whether we can Well. Now, I see that the ORGANIZATION3 and ORGANIZATION4 platform are the same thing actually,, so so the question is, can we get it running on our side? And what what should we do for that? And if you have any reasons why we should not be allowed to to run the platform on our side on our machines, then can you provide access for both users, and also modul providers now so that we can test it well had, and we have already some, information for from ORGANIZATION4 but I'm still not able to interpret this because I haven't read the documentation of the of the connector. So back to the original question. How difficult would it be,, to get the full system running on our machines? So, PERSON15, I don't hear you, if you are saying anything, I can not hear anything.",
            "Yes, I'm, I'm just re-reading the four topics.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think that we have to reason a little bit more about this topic. Sorry.",
            "Yeah, okay. So so then I see two reasons why getting a full replica running in LOCATION1 would be difficult. One is like the licensing things. So that you don't want us to to have it. And the other would be technical things that it is a software, which is like a build in pieces and it's not too easy to, to get it running,. So which which of these reasons are the the more important ones?",
            "Probably the the second have everything working with the require a lot of work. But maybe it's better to talk about these topic with PERSON14 which unfortunately is not here today, I know, but we will discuss about it later.",
            "Yeah, yeah, obviously. So so that is obviously not the point of of these like training session today, get the mediator running. That will be another session for this needed. And first you need to get the to discuss this with PERSON14. Okay. So I see. And they the fall back, then should however be possible. And maybe the fall back is something which is going to be resolved after they the training today, if we are not running the mediator the that the hard of that system ourselves. How do we get, how do we connect to the hard running at at ORGANIZATION3 or or your servers,",
            "Well, you can connects to the ORGANIZATION4 mediator, which is the one we provide you access. You have just to use the given URL and the given ports for worker.",
            "Yeah, okay. So this is this is.",
            "Running and you can keep I think.",
            "Yeah, okay. And what what like tools what machine translation systems. And ASR systems are already connected there. If any?",
            "No at the moment it's completely empty.",
            "Empty. Okay. Yeah. So we w for the So this is good for testing whether our API works in principle. But it is still not sufficient for full test for the March event. So what should we do as a full test for the March event? And this is also question for for ORGANIZATION3, whether like they have this mediator running elsewhere,, with the appropriate ASR and and the the OTHER4 ASR, and OTHER3 ASR, and and their ORGANIZATION3 OTHER3 OTHER4 translation system running or, if so if if they will provide us with similar connection details for their mediator., or if we should use this mediator, which is now running at at ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION3 should connect their components to this, and we should like set up everything around, this mediator. So what what would ORGANIZATION3 prefer? So I guess the first suppose that was we could OTHER3 OTHER4, OTHER4 OTHER3 system. To the mediator ORGANIZATION4 and we make my connect our website of that we see that works.",
            "Okay. That would be excellent. There will be test as PERSON8 said that would test whether the current version of the mediator is compatible with the connectors as as you have them and we will connect to that to,, when we have our translation system wrapped, and we'll see how that cooperates, and and how it doesn't recognize pieces and so on., so I'll I'll wrote down here that ORGANIZATION3 will, connect their tools including the web presentation,, to this and let us, let ORGANIZATION1 know so that we can test it out, right? So this is this is very good. And I think that this, this particular ORGANIZATION4 mediator, which is already running will be the the the heart of the live system that will be used in March, right? Can can we rely on that? Is that like big enough?",
            "Yes, maybe URL, URL and the porter may change, but we will provide a platform, don't worry.",
            "Yeah. And and that is it will be the very same version of of this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And a technical thing, if we So there is still many things to be like discussed and prepare for the for the fair in March., but one of them is that there will be probably more sites like more locations at the fair, which will need this, or which will benefit from this translation. There is the main stage, and like the secondary stage. And there is also a chance that we'll have our booth, and that so for the booth, the idea is that we would have an offline system. If ORGANIZATION3 has has,, set up physical set up one notebook that runs everything., that people can see on the spot, that would be nice., we know that the Internet connection would be limited only to some places and the at the venue. So this. One the booth presentation should not to rely on any Internet connection. And then the one or two places will obviously need Internet connection.. So if we have two sides that are interpreting things., will we need two such meditators, or is it the the that one such mediator can do choose independence streams of of translation? Should be one mediator. We just need several workers then so several MT and ASR workers.",
            "Okay. So within one mediator you can easily like set up that the subtitles coming that the speech signal coming from one microphone or one source gets translated. And and, and produce to one particle output channel of this mediator, and the same mediator can handle another channel. Of another, audio source to another, like final display, web display platform, right? Yes, normally you have several sessions, so you would have then two sessions, they are all displayed like. There is like than one website which just play the whole sessions, and people can select which session they want to follow.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's that's good. So we should be with this particular mediator, or maybe a replacement one. If if the the different port and and different IP address.. We should be set up.. We just need to connect the various tools, and we can play around with that. And, one last thing is the recording capacity., I assume that ORGANIZATION4 already has some it's not a worker. It's actually like a sink.. So, some,, some connect something some component that will connect to the same mediator,, and it will record the audio signal to a file on on a disk. Is such tool, does such a tool exist?",
            "Well, actually, we have some, let's say worker which performs audio recording, but we share the last time that, I I don't remember, who has to develop more stable components to record the audio.",
            "Okay. So so this is something that we should include in our tests, but it's existing in principle, and it should be easy to, to get running.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay? So thank you very much. So this was everything from the like organization point of view from me and I would like now to hand out the, the presentation to PERSON15 for all the details about the platform they they want to share with us.So I'll stop sharing my screen.",
            "Okay. And I'll share my screen.Let's see. Share documents. Okay. Just give me one second, please. Okay, pretty good. Okay, do you see the whole slide, or just the half?",
            "I see post of the slide. I see like the center. You can maybe, yeah, yeah, I was zoomed that out, and there is also one option to fit page. So this is the best you can get. We'll always have a preview of the upcoming slide, unfortunately.",
            "Well, I think that we are all technician, and we can aset also this this presentation.",
            "If you want to underline something, you can even click the the the draw and then possibly you can There is an option to to use the marker and draw on the slides.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Maybe you saw that for for a second.",
            "Are we ready?",
            "Yes, please.",
            "Everyone? Okay,, first of all, welcome to everybody, I'm PERSON15, I'm senior software developer in ORGANIZATION4. Actually, I'm a Java developer. So please be indulgent with my C programming skills. Okay, today I will try to explain you the Okay. Thank you, wau.Assistance. I will try to explain you the ORGANIZATION4 service architecture idea. We will have a work view of the system and then we will go trough ex Let's say flow chart explaining the the flow of the interactions, and as more example of code. Okay. The the ORGANIZATION4 service architecture is implemented as a client service, client server architecture, clients connects to a mediator which distributes the request and the load amongs avalaible workers. scenario. Clients are the that sends the data and the the workers represent different call components like ASR, SLT, MT and so on. And the usually client in service architecture sends and repo Actually usually clients in ORGANIZATION4 service architecture both sends and receives data. In our scenario clients will just send data because processed data with the publish on other platforms. But let's keep it simply for the moment and assume that clients both sends and receives data. Well, you you know, such kind of infrastructure is a distributed one, it has really convenient API which hides protocol complexity, and it's completely asynchronous and integration will be based on callbacks implementation. The clients start, oh well. The PDF export was unfair on this slide. I'm sorry. But actually, the image was exactly the one in the previous slide. The clients start the service request by specifying the type and the language of the output stream. And by specifying the type and the language of the input stream. For example the caption use case the clients specifies OTHER3 UK audio stream as output and OTHER3 UK as-Oh my gosh., where's the example? Just a seconds, sorry. Okay, I'm back. Sorry for moving the documents. ORGANIZATION4 service architecture client and worker interaction, connection is based on message exchange, clients connect to the service architecture. They will send media streams like text, audio, image and so on. The subscribe to a service specifying their output type, output fingerprint. and requires a service specifying their input type and input fingerprint. For example use case the clients specify OTHER3 UK audio as output stream and OTHER3 UK captions, let's say, as input stream. Workers instead register to this service architecture with one or multiple services that I, they are able to handle. For example I'm able to perform ASR from for the OTHER3, OTHER1 OTHER3 language.. Each worker accept just one incoming service request per connection. And in order to make to be sure to process all the incoming request, there exists some queue for processing all the incoming requests. Okay. When we talk about language actually we talk about fingerprints. Fingerprints are used to specify the exact language and the general media. They are pretty pretty simple, they need 2 letters for language code optional 2 letters for country code and again optional additional strings specifying the the domain of of the stream., the domain it's it's important for example for ASR workers in order to describe, for example, the domain of the language model used in the ASR process. Usually the language part might be sufficient. But just to know that there the exist this possibility. Okay and we talk about input and output types. Those are the stream types, which I use to specify the type of the media, for a fully specified input or output media stream both fingerprint, and type must be specified. And well, supported type streams are audio, image, text and unseg-text, which is the one used by ASR hypotheses. Well and this is the decor of the the problem of managing client requests and worker services. The mediation problem. If a client declares for example, it wants to output OTHER3 audio, and OTHER3 audio, let say. OTHER3 is aaa OTHER1 OTHER3 is the output fingerprint. Audio is the output type. And it request OTHER3 unsegment text as input fingerprint and input type, the mediator must find one or of multiple workers that are able to converts audio containing OTHER1 OTHER3 speech, into OTHER3 unsegmented text. For example the OTHER3 ASR worker is able to accomplish this kind of request. But this is the case that just requires one worker, the mediator, which is the core of the ORGANIZATION4 service architecture is able also to accomplish more complex requests concatenating different workers. Well, messages between the mediator and the client and workers are transport the Xml packets. We have a specific type, you will find the types described in the cloud XS the file which is in the ORGANIZATION4 platform sample code on Github.",
            "May I have a question about the packating. So, so far you have talked about the stream. And now you talk about packets, packets. So, what is the granularity in or is it up to the the user?, if you have the input audio stream who does the segmentation? I think there's a a a quite a bit of logic that can affect these decisions.. So, we need to be sure that this is done reasonably. And there will be lot of like options, to to experiment with, so that the experience is the best for the user. Can you tell us more about this?",
            "Yeah, the real time use case is a little bit complex, but in the batch audio file processing for example you, the client is in charge of splitting audio files into bytes and send them using for example, the data packets. And when it test finished sending all the data it will send the the done message, we will see in in a minutes. To declared that he has finished sending all the all data. Is it clear?",
            "So I understand that the 2 modes of operation. One is for the batch processing, and one is for the online processing. And in general, most of your presentation will be for the badge start processing,, because But but hopefully we'll later also get to the details of the of the online style of processing.",
            "Today we will keep things a little bit simple but in the ORGANIZATION4 platform report you should find example also to, let it works like a real times stream. You will find the sample coder in the in the report.",
            "Yeah. Okay. So this is something that, like someone knowledgeable should should double check for us. When we are implementing the connector so that we use the the correct demo for the online processing and not for the batch processing, and and and so on. So this is important that.",
            "Oh, don't worry. In the in the code you will find a lot of comments, detailed explaining you exactly, all the possible options, don't worry. But in any case we can provide you some some support, of course.",
            "Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, so for we as ORGANIZATION1 will need both set ups, will be doing both the online things for the ORGANIZATION2 events, and also the document level like document processing. And this is something that we still need to decide whether we will make use of the platform or not. This is unclear. But if we do use the, do use the platform then, then it will be a batch processing. So we'll need both eventually poss, or possibly,. And I was also curious about the, the practical limits. When you talk about the batch processing,. So is it okay, to feed in four hours or eight hours of of recording through this, or will so it it could lead to files, larger than 4 gigabytes on the platform, machine, and so on. So what are the practical limits of this.",
            "Well actually, practical limits are space left on device. You know, yet, maybe to to reason about.",
            "Yeah, so before we do this. We should definitely talk to you. But in principle, there is no like arbitrary limit such as the, there used to be some fall systems that couldn't handle files larger than four gigabytes, and and so on. So you are no longer affected by this.",
            "Oh, well, my opinion it's strictly related to ASR, for example, worker. And I think that there is no limits, just memory and space on disk.",
            "Yeah. Okay.Thank you.",
            "Yeah, you are welcome. Okay. We were talking about packet types. Okay. Here we can see the packet type. We have data packet which contain exchanged data. And data may be audio, text or image. And then we have a couple of status packet types, which are done sent by the client to when all the data has been sent. Error when sent when occurs an error of course. Reset, sent whenever the client, or the worker should reset if initial state, usually it depends on at the end of conversation. And flush, which is sent whenever the client, or the worker should finalize the processing which is the common flush method. Okay. And now we talk about how the initial handshake for client and the I think for worker immediately after the spot. Yes. Okay. This is our the client present itself to the mediator, it test to declare it's output stream first of all. Okay. Actually cloud at the flow description. I have to say it's you will going to use cloud out the flow description to method, but basically it is used to sent a some human readible description of the of the process is going to start. For example, weather forecast of 27th June 2012, for example. After the flow description is specified, the client has to connect to the mediator and then it's specify its output stream description, using this cloud announce output stream. And it's specify is output type and output fingerprints. And also us which can be the some stream, some unique ID which is used to uniqely identify the stream. Actually a client may specify more than one output stream, but it will not be our case. Okay, and if the client as also to require some input which is not always the case I have to say, test to specify the input type and the input fingerprint of the input stream. So using the cloud announce output stream it declares the output stream credential. Let's say, then the output type and the output fingerprint using cloud announce using cloud request input stream it instead the declares the desired input type and input fingerprint. Ookay. Well, curiosity let's say, client is allowed to request multiple different input stream for one stream. Maybe, for example, he wants to send in OTHER1 OTHER3 audio, and wants to receive the OTHER6 text translation. But also the OTHER1 OTHER3 caption fo example. On the other end a worker is require to register to the mediator providing the information about the server providing. The information the service can provide, okay. Okay,. I repeat. The worker register to the mediator, providing the information about the services. He can provide, slightly better. Okay. A worker may be able to offer multiple services but only one service can be active at the same time per connection. Okay. This is an example of the client application., I don't know if you are able to read it well, but actually is the. Okay, thank you. Is the the program flow in the documentation. Okay, this is the typical client implementation., for example in the ORGANIZATION4s, in the Gitlab report, we share there a file which is the client example, which is probably the most complete. Okay, the client first creates the cloud a structure after starts. And the structure is used to keep all the necessary information for the data exchanges between the client and the mediator. Okay, see oh well, cloud create is the as function you will use cloud create too. And there exist also the possibility to establish an SSL connection with cloud create SSL too., I'm sorry the slides are not the updated. But fortunately, the API documentation is pretty complete. Okay, after cloud create, it adds flow description, specifying the name and the description of the flow that is handled by the client. It connects to the mediator that is running on a specific host and port in our example mediator dot ORGANIZATION4 dot IT. And I don't remember by heart to the port but it's written, don't worry., okay. When the connection is established the client can announce the output stream.. And then if an inputs stream is required which as I already told you, it might not be the case. sometimes clients just want to upload things, and they doesn't care about results, but if that cas, in this case, when it cares about results. It test to specify input type and input fingerprint calling cloud request input stream. Okay. Then I don't like that graph that much. I have to say, in order to be able to receive and process packets. While sending packets. The the process is a little bit complex I have to say but it's really well described in the sample code then don't worry., of course, if you want to both sent and receive you have to do everything asynchronously. So for this reason data are put in queue, the the data that ha that has to be send are put in the sending queue. And the data that arrives are put in the processing queue. When he test finished sending all the data, you have to call the cloud to with finish, which actually sees everything is manage asynchronously. The main thread populate process the sending queue. And you actually don't know when it has finish to sen to send all the data, then you use these method cloud with finish to wait until all the data has been sent. If something was wrong, you can use another method which is not written here but hopefully is writing next slide which is cloud brak. Which is called by the error call back. And this use to stop sending with the remaining data. As I told you also the packet the received packet are received asynchronously. And the data are in the processing queue.. If okay. We are here. And the keep waiting for data and heel and done message arrives from the mediator. Then the clients can disconnected from the mediator. And that's it. Please note that in order to process a new media stream and service request, and your connect needs to be established, and this is the client flow. Let's have a look little bit to the callbacks and queues involved, okay. Okay. Okay, we have two main queues processing queue and sending queue., sending queue is used for sending messages. Okay. Easy. And packets are appended to this queue for sending. In case of any error the callback function set by you see, it's a little bit small but under each queue you have the callbacks that can be set for this queue. And under the, okay it's really small, I'm sorry., okay sending queue you can set cloud, this are the method names, you can set the error callback and the break callback. In case of error the error callback is used, and when there something to be handle the, mainthread, and you have to stop sending data the brek call back is used. If the clientes request the an input stream, the resection of packet should also be done in a seperated trade. In this case by calling req message asink, you see it on the top of the slide. This thread simply wait for incoming packet and take specific actions depending on the packet type. This, this will be aconstance switch among packet types. In case of data messages the packet is appended to the processing queue, in case of done message cloud wait finish is called. In case of error or reset message it stop the processing using cloud the break. For the processing queue here. we have different for different callbacks which can be used. Which are data callback called the for each packet in the queue sequentially. Here you put your handling of the input stream. Finalize callback which is called the mediator signals that all the worker involving service request have finish processing the data. This means that the clients safely, can safely disconnect from the mediator. And of course you know, error callback for errors, and break callback when mcloud break has being called. Really simple. Okay. Worker example program flow, which is I think a little bit simpler., in the Github report refer to the backend ASR to example which is probably one of the most compleats. As the client to the first thing that the the worker do is to prepare the mcloud the structure. Which keep the necessary information about for the data exchange between worker and mediator. Then it adds service description that are offered by the worker by specifying the attention. Worker specifies input type, input fingerprint, but also output type and output fingerprint. They need connects to the mediator, that is running on a specific host and the ports. And the it waits for client requests, and teh when a requests arrives it waits for the next packets, which of course the first time it waits for the first packet. which arrives from the client stream, and this time too it performs the friend actions depending on the message type. And here we have the split let's say based on the message type. If an error occur or arrives are reset message, the processing is stopped. It calls the mcloud break, The connection is terminated and the worker waits again for a new client connection. In case of done message it the mcloud wait finish is called, in order to let worker wait until all pending packets in the processing queue have been processed. And then again, the connection with client is terminated, and the worker waits for new client connection. In case of data message the packets are simply appended to the processing queue, and the worker waits for the next packets arrive. In case of flush message. The worker waits until all appending packets had been processed by calling the mcloud wait finish. And then it sends a flush message informing the next worker to flush it's queus as well. And then again it turns to wait for new new client connection., and that's all I think. Please note that to the client the worker always keep the connection with mediator. Ok. And here we have again worker queues and callback overview. available callbacks for the processing queue. Our data callback which is the function call the for each packet in the queue sequentially. You put here the data processing limitation, after processing you have to send immediately processing data in order to keep the latency lot. And the data are send by appending them to the sending queue. T. Hen we have finalize callback, which is called as soon as the mediator that the client as finish sending the data, again error and the break. And that's it. I think. Yep., just a note about break callback., remember to reset all the queue since the connection is finished and then you have to free your your data structure. Okay. The API also provides here say convenience function., in in particular interesting are the ones used for prepare packets for sending which prepare the packet to be send based on your data type really useful. Just a couple of things regarding more technical details.. Okay, here you have GetAttr and SetAttr of specific feature. Okay. GetAttr and SetAttr. Okay this one is much more interesting, which is word token. in order to be able to pass additional information, which usually are are required by ASR or machine translation use case. You can prepare packets containing array of word. And these allows you this is a word token the data structure. You can see it allows you to specify both start and stop time for example, as well as confidence, and you can use You can prepare your data structure,, using word token, or what token array if a more words of course, and then you can prepare your packets to be sent using mcloud from word token. And A means array, you can use just also for well known for word token., okay. Packets also contains time stamp which are used, so let you be able to align the media stream produced by the workers, with the media stream provided by the clients. This is used for, for example, to sign subtitle to original audio. Time stamps are in the leaders of each packet, and can be used - they have different meaning based on the packet type, when you send. Okay. Time stamps are both in the packet header and in the word token array. time stamp in the packet header are absolut time stamps within the media stream. And instead word token array time stamps are relatives time stamps, based the on the starting position of the media stream, of course you have to sign with a media stream sending word token array, the time stamp use in this situation, will be relative to the beginning media stream. Okay, we provided you all the simple code there are a lot of example in particular I like the client example and the backend ASR too which are two example of client and worker. The Git repo contains the the binary form of the C-library, header files, documentation and lot of examples. Here you have the connection data to connect to the ORGANIZATION4 mediator. You can choose to establish SSL or not connection is the same, let's say. Let me not of course the same but both are working. Now, maybe it is better to go through an example of code. Actually I see reported the documentation examples but I don't like them that much. And maybe I can try to share with you my my desktop and see the working examples. Just give me one second. Ok. Now, you should see my Unfortunately I'm not on my PC but you should see my notepad plus plus editor. Here, we have okay, thank you. Here we have the backend ASR to example which is the one provided in the Github repo. You can see there are lot of comments then it should be pretty easy to go through the implementation. Okay, let's start. Okay, some utility. Okay. Here we have the Are okay. This worker performs a kind of ASR processing actually it performs nothing. It just simulates the ASR handling of data. You will see it just sends back silly text for receiving audio data. Here we have all the callbacks implementation. In it callback, data callback which is the one used to the ASR processing, the callback sample in initialize your service. Data callback you put here your processing of incoming data. Here perform some reason about time and so on.,,.",
            "And the machine translation worker will be essentially the same thing, except that if it the messages will be of different type, and the byte that you receive will be interpreted differently.",
            "No. Well. The power of this solution is that, it will be exactly let's say you have just to put your implement service implementation in to the right callback, and manage the the the service, for example what to do when error occurs or when all the data has been send, maybe you want to let's say update the data base. I don't know. And everything is always the same. Here we have silly ASR process. But the idea is that you will put the machine translation service implementation in to the data callback for example. Okay. Here you can see that after the silly processing it prepares the data to be sent using function. We see in this slide. Then use the mcloud send packet in order to feed that the queue. And this was the data callback finalize callback it's pretty empty. Break callback in this example we the nothing. I also in the error callback we perform nothing but for example you want to print a log or perform some kind of action to manage the error. Or to report the error and so on. And here we have the main function. Okay. And these here we have the important part. Here the mcloud object is created. It prepares data structure. Adds, the service than and shake with the mediator. telling that he he is able to provide a specific service. Populates the callback passing specific function and in some case also specifying the processing queue. The the queue related. Then it connects, to the mediator. And here actually it starts the processing if we have Here we have, cycle. It waits for a client, waits for next packet. And when packet arrives, it switch between packet types. Then mcloud data arrives and it adds to the processing queue., arrives mcloud flush. And then it waits for processing queue and then sends flush to the other to the other workers. Done and so on. And here, this is logic I strongly suggest it because it works really good. Wait for packet switch among data types and implement your logic. Okay. Okay. That's it. And this is everything you need in your worker. now we see the client by directional example, which is also in the in the Github repo. Okay. We have seen the worker. Now we see the clients parts. The example is a little bit complex speech because is is really flexible. It will allow you to try to send really a lot of it will allow you to perform a lot of different use keys test. Then the call is a little bit more complex. But we will try to go through. Through it. Again you have callback function, which is are not those one. But are Okay, this are just utility function writes at the end. Okay. And you we have a data callbacks, yes the callback implementation. Here you put what to do when packet arrives, in this example you for example can write a CTM or write a plain text, or a lot of other things. For example. Okay. each function is implemented in a different callback and based on user common line option, the right callback is import. Again, finalize callback, break callback, error callback are pretty empy empty because if just an example but in real production example of course you have to end all these kind of situation. Here we have message asign. Which is the function I told you in the client program flow which is not a library method but is an approach you will see in our examples. And basically again it waits for next packet switch among data types, packet types. That's it. Here we have the main. But important is the orchestration which is really simple even if it's put among all these line of codes. Here we have. Common line options. Okay, ok, here you can see it will try to simulate real type mode. For example. Okay. But here is the the beginning of the handshake. Creates mcloud object. add flow description. Then it connects to the mediator, announce its output stream, this is used to display on add displey service which is not up and running at the moment, but it's the same. Callbacks are set here. Those are set for the sending queue, and based on the specified parenitars also the callbacks for the processing queue are set. It in its the packet type based on the use keys chosen. After the emit there's always the send of the packet. And when all the data are sent wait finish is used to wait that. Well, when all the data are queued on the sending queue wait finish is used to wait until all the data are send. When all the data are send, this connects. And I think that this is everything. Okay. And that's all. We are going to prepare also some kind of support side. For example on our support system. At the moment I'm not aware about the, the specific e-mail to write but will provide you as soon as possible these information. I have finished.",
            "Okay. Thank you. So I'll now present my screen. And just you show.",
            "I'm sorry, I know that they are a lot of technical information, but please don't be scare. The documentation is really complete and there are lot of commented example in the repo.",
            "Yeah, thank you.. So I would just like to scroll the the ORGANIZATION7 document that everybody has shared. One important thing that I have found is that we have a list of deadlines for that's not really for the fair for the student fair. It's more for the ORGANIZATION2 events that we are going to to run later on. And this document also mentions that the description of the cables and so on is something which will need earlier than in, by the end of the week. The deadlines say that we would like to have this, by February, the fifteens. So in three days from now. So I have just assigned this to PERSON8, if PERSON8 could to this quicker.. That will be great., and then,, I have tried to capture all the details. So in the meantime. So we already have the meditator running, and then,, we've agreed that ORGANIZATION3 will connect their tolls to this meditators for. And for the fair I have summarized what we will need one or two sessions, and OTHER3 OTHER5 and possibly OTHER4 ASR, so the OTHER5 is, to be, provided by ORGANIZATION1 if we actually manage manage that.. So from ORGANIZATION3 I would like to have the OTHER3 ASR and OTHER3 OTHER4 MT, and the web presentation form in this in this mediator as soon as possible like at your earliest convenience. And again I've assigned this to PERSON8, but feel free to re-asign, I don't know who who is the one at ORGANIZATION3 who can who can add workers to, to the system. And, I've also mentioned that we'll need the recording client. So PERSON15 please provide us with the recording clients so that we can also connected to this mediator,",
            "The recording worker example, is a ready in the ORGANIZATION4 sample code. But I strongly suggest use it just an example. And to prepare something much stable.",
            "Yeah. So and you mentioned that you have some stable version somewhere or not?",
            "Not, we agreed that someone we agreed the last time that someone else will prepare the stable version, unfortunately, PERSON14 is not here, and I don't remember the right information.",
            "Okay. Yeah. So, um-hum. But this is not stable yet so Yeah, I'm not sure whether we will have the capacity to to do this properly. So is there any chance when you talk to PERSON14 that ORGANIZATION4 will have the capacity to to prepare the recording client to test it properly?",
            "Oh, I think that it's not on on the schedule, sorry. Maybe you have to ask it directly to PERSON14.",
            "Okay. So we'll see because this is this is important, we needed for for the fair.",
            "Thank you.",
            "And we also need it in the longer term for, the recording from the ORGANIZATION6 platform. So I hope the ORGANIZATION6 team is still listening to this. Because this is the way that we'll be doing the recording from the, ORGANIZATION6s meetings, and we for the project according to the project time line, I think we need to start recording by the end of March or something like that. So that actually with, with the fair quite well, but we need to have it done. Yeah, so this So. This is something bending.",
            "PERSON10 from ORGANIZATION6 I have it right now., did you just say that the audio recording is required for the for the fair?",
            "Sorry, I couldn't hear you, your voice was too quiet. Quality was good but it was too quiet.",
            "Okay. Is it better like that?",
            "Yeah, Thank you. So what was your question?",
            "Did you just say that the audio recording is required for the fair?",
            "Not for the fair. Well. Yes, for the fair, but not for a well, it's difficult. So there is several use cases. And one of the use cases is that at the fair we will have but ORGANIZATION6 is not that much involved in the fair. So that's why you you don't need to worry. But at the fair we will have people presenting their countries or whatever. In ninety seconds like little pitches. And each of these pitches will be held in OTHER3 by non-native speaker. So we made it more interesting for the student participant by saying that it will be competition for them in terms of, pronunciation quality. And we will record their speeches. They it would be subtitles on the flies, so that others can can have the support from from that subtitling. But after the student finishes their 90 seconds, they will go to the backstage and they will hear they own voice. And they will manually write down the transcript, and we will then use standard ASR measures to measure the quality how much they, how much the ASR departed from their own transcript. And it is fair competition, because it is fixed length of of speech,, and it's themselves transcribing their own voice and they don't know what the ASR has made with that. So, they can not cheat and and like artificially introduce errors that the ASR introduced. So for this reason we need to record what they are saying, and the recording can obviously be done like independently of that platform as the fallback solution. But I think it would be better and easier to do it directly on the platform to have one of this recording worker connected to that. So that's why we need the recording for for for the fair. And the other use case is that we, for the minuting approach for the remote meetings.. We need to record data and the call such as this one that we have the internal PROJECT1 calls are also a nice source. And also we have some other possible groups of people remotely communicating and for this we need some platform for like remote calls, that has the recording capacity. And since the I ORGANIZATION6 platform is the one that we've agreed to use for for the project. The sooner we have the recording in the ORGANIZATION6 set up in some way, the sooner we can start using ORGANIZATION6 instead of this Adobe connect thing, for example. So that's and we have a a milestone for this, in the in the proposal. So that's why I would like you to to have the recording there. And if I'm not mistaken the, the recording capacity of the ORGANIZATION6 is scheduled for March, which coin which almost coincide with the fair recording capacity, and recording in in ORGANIZATION6 can be done in various ways. And one of the possible ways is that you will connect to the ORGANIZATION4 platform, which you will have to do anyway, and then the recording will be done by the ORGANIZATION4 recording worker. So this is what we've discussed early when we were like planning how to do the recording the exist way for you. So this is what we thought was the existed. I don't know whether it is still the easiest option now or if there are any easier options.",
            "So as to my knowledge, we agreed that we would do the recording independently for now.",
            "Okay.",
            "This is what we are currently working on.",
            "Okay, yeah. So this, maybe maybe this some negotiation that you had also directly with ORGANIZATION4 and I was not involve in that.",
            "In the sorry. In the shared examples, there is the audio recorder worker example, which could be eventually, a good starting points,",
            "So you must know, we have our own audio set up an audio service.",
            "Okay.",
            "Which which just output the the audio that's being, you know, spread across all members or all participants, dump the audio out put into a file.",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.",
            "And these files would end up on AWS as three.",
            "And we will we would make it available for.",
            "Okay. Cool.",
            "Okay, yeah. So this is an independent.",
            "The connection to the mediator and this would be more complex for us. So as a first step we thought, just dumping audio into a file would be easier to get, audio recording up and running.",
            "Yes, this is this is very good for the project purposes for the recording of the meetings. So this means that you will be. It will be easy for you to make the the March milestone, and we could start having our calls within the ORGANIZATION6 platform that's excellent., I have just one technical question about this. You mention that you will be dumping to one file.",
            "No, not exactly it would every participant would have its own.",
            "Excellent. So we don't have to do speaker.",
            "Yeah, so we have a different streams for each participant.",
            "That's that's very good, and and they are synchronized. So, you know, which like they all start at the same point, the time stamps are are global time stamps.",
            "That I actually don't know.",
            "Anyone hear me? Does this work?",
            "Yes, we hear you.",
            "Yeah, we have time stamps but don't know if they it, but it a real time stream. So if there is no data. No, if there is no nobody speaking at a moment I don't know be data so there is no time stamp for this. Timeframe.",
            "Yeah, So what what do you need to have for the minuting processing later on is like these sequence, or overlabs in which the the people were talking obviously. So it's great that you have separate streams that that frees us from doing, speaker., but we also need to know the sequence as it was by the participants. And for this. We need the global time stamps.",
            "And, as we are for the real for the later when we send it up at ORGANIZATION4, it will be realtime stream.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, it could contain time stamps yeah. But the recording redo is like it not content time stamps.",
            "Yeah. So this is this is something that that should be probably added. Because otherwise, I don't know how it would like extract the original overall.",
            "Could, could we do a continuous by the recording? Like over the whole meeting?",
            "The the problem is, we are not at that point. And if someone is not speaking, we have no data to write down in the file.",
            "So we would need an script of file. Which carries time stamps.",
            "Yes, that would also do the work. Like if you had if you had some mapping between the global time, and the whatever positions in in the various channels.",
            "But we would end up with on a on lot of audio files, PERSON.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So right now, I'm thinking, whether it would be better to to go the direct way and have look at the mediator recording. But we can talk about this.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So this this fill free to discuss directly with ORGANIZATION4 and decide whatever is easier and more appropriate for you., and I'll have someone look at at the recording worker example, and I'll also try to talk to PERSON14, because I I think that it would be the easiest. If if ORGANIZATION4 had the capacity to the recording worker, but it will still be quite simple recording. So, one drawback of going through the platform. If I understand correctly is that it will already do the the the mixing of the channels. And if we save the separate channels.. We will have a the the great benefit of of avoiding speaker diarization. So I think for the processing from the processing point of view, it's it's better to have separate channels. And somehow like work around with a time stamps than to have perfect mixed channel., that great time stamps but is mixed and and you can not separated the speakers and it anymore in it. In an easy way.",
            "I assumed third resend still send each speaker separately to the ORGANIZATION4 platform.",
            "Yeah, so this is something that's maybe PERSON15 can can answer. I don't know how how the platform handles separate channels because so far with briefly touched upon the the concept of sessions., but we haven't touched upon the concept of channels.",
            "Well, actually, the platform doesn't manage. If you are talking about the the service architecture platform, doesn't manage channels. It just manage audio streams. It's in charged to the worker and the client to manage eventually, audio channels.",
            "So to handle channels. You would use your descriptors. You would somehow like label the different channels with the speaker ID or whatever. And, you would have to have as many recording workers as there are speakers, right?",
            "Well. I'm not so aware of the diarization use case, but for in case of automatic speech recognition, you prepare worker who interacts with the automatic speech recognition engine, which requires streams. And if different cl-channel management is required then is in charge to the automatic speech recognition system to managed it. the service architecture just manage streams and it's not a whereabouts audio channels, let's say.",
            "So what set up?",
            "Sorry?",
            "So we would create a stream per user?",
            "For example.",
            "And technically you will have then one mediator, and you would have ASR system well.",
            "Yeah.. The mediator is only the mediator is always just once and then in charge to manage the interaction between client and workers., we haven't go through the mediator topic today, because I I was thinking that it was not on the the PROJECT1 project interest. But actually it just prepares worker it search for workers path, in order to accomplish client request, and the mediator is just one, many workers can connects to the mediator. A worker can pro can manage just one connection per time, then if you have to manage two streams for example in the, at the same time, you have to be able to run two workers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And of course, they might be just different instances of the same thing.",
            "Yes.",
            "And maybe interact with the same automatic speech recognition system. but from the architecture a point of view it have to be different. And and that's it.",
            "Yeah, that that make sense so.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the alph so the the set up if we have now we are more discussing like the, translated or interpreted remote conference. So imagine that we have ten people participating in the same online remote conference in the ORGANIZATION6 platform. Each of the person speaks different language. And ideally, we would like to see, we would like to hear the the mix of languages. And see subtitles in one selected language., at each of the end points. So each of the endpoints, the end users will have, this will be a separate channel in the ORGANIZATION6 platform. This separate general will be connected through its own separate client to the ORGANIZATION4 mediator., and then,, there will be a number of ASR workers., each labeled with the language it can recognize we will know which of the speakers speaks which language there could be five speakers of OTHER3,, and So there will be five clients that produce that like populated, of Produce OTHER3 sound packets to, the, to the, mediator. The mediator would have many OTHER3 ASR workers. There could be more then the speakers are which cases like over capacity., there could be fewer workers, then how many there are speakers of OTHER3, in which case,, some of the, request will be delayed. But in principle, it would like processes them after that as well. And if not all the speakers of OTHER3 will be speaking at the same time. Then the fewer workers will be stay still able to handle that concurrently. And each of these ASR workers would do the transcription into into OTHER3 subtitles and then there would be one client again per per the endpoint that would would grab the subtitles and and display them,, on the on the side of of the end user. So this is for the live set up.",
            "PERSON17, I think it was a less worker it won't work. Because if we you less workers, the streams will just not be stabile, because it would says there is no worker available. And I guess switching like sharing workers between sessions is not possible. So you need as many workers as you have at least as many workers as as you have speakers.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. But you mentioned again sessions. So how our sessions related to the channels?",
            "In that's up to the design of the How you want to design it. I mean the easiest thing which is of course will not be the best for resources. But the easiest thing would be one session per channel. And then you have an independent system for each. The problem then you have that's why you need time stamp that in the end you need to synchronize all the different sessions as, so that the the output the translation can be displayed nicely. Because now at the moment, it only supports like one channel one session. So the easiest thing to extend it would be to have one session per channel. And then at the end march again, the outputs.",
            "Mm-hmm, yeah. And the recording is also complicating complicating things, because then you would meet to have one saver so the say per session and without time stamps you would not know how this relates how to reconstruct the the whole stream. The mix stream, right?.",
            "Time stamps anyway, if you send anything to the mediator you have to put in time stamps. Because each measu message has a times stamps, so we will have the time stamps in the mediator, because you can not send anything without time stamps.",
            "Yeah. So now it is for ORGANIZATION6 to decide whether they what is the easiest for them, whether to include timestamps somehow to their, like separate channels for the recording purposes, or whether it is easier already to implement the client.. So that each ORGANIZATION6 client behaves as a client for the ORGANIZATION4 mediator, and then, and then, the and how to s do the set up within the platform.",
            "Yeah, so we will discuss internally, and we will discuss internally but maybe contact you, PERSON15.",
            "Maybe it's better to contact PERSON14. Thank you.",
            "Ok.",
            "Okay. So for, so for the fair we know that there is the simple recording client. And we need you to polish it. And for the, for the recording of our meetings within ORGANIZATION6 we will know later, when when ORGANIZATION6 talks to to PERSON14. And and when when the decision is met. Thank you. So I try to record this later in the in the notes,, and there, for for this session, that PERSON15 presented. I would just like to ask PERSON15 or PERSON1 more to provide the details. So we,, everybody knows where the code is, the slides, if you could upload them somewhere.",
            "Yes, of course. I will uploaded the slides in the ORGANIZATION4 platform sample co sample connector repo.",
            "Yes, yes. And then just add a link here or something like or let me know.",
            "Talk directory.",
            "Yeah, okay thank you. And yes, when I was listening to that presentation., I had this question, whether the platform will seamlessly scale up to the ORGANIZATION5 use case where we expect about six input channels for six different languages and up to 43 target language subtitles. So, I've kind of worried that if we have so many independent machine translation systems connected to to this, the platform may also have some a nontrivial overhead. And this is, this is like this is something that we do not have to resolve fully, in the next few months. But within the year, we have to have this resolve properly., and and.",
            "Actually the the system is meant to be able to scale up to to this kind of sizes. I don't know exactly how many worker and interaction we manage during the project, but okay. It should work.",
            "Yeah, it should work. Okay, that's that's good.. So, related question is, if we develop machine translation systems that produce more outputs, like more target languages at the same time, because there are like benefits at least the saving GPU memory or something like that. So so that you have a, we don't have the systems yet. But this is what we are experimenting with in within year one. We would like to have one machine translations systems that can translate from one language into six languages at the same time, and when I say at the same time., I mean,, that,. It is two, two things either it can be like producing one output language at a time. So you ask it six times and it will give you six different target languages for the same input string, or you can run these even in in a in a badge on the GPU. So you will have the same., input sentence translated into six languages at the, like at once, thanks to the if in the GPU. And now we have this system. And what would be the best set up to connect this system to the to the platform, because it would the same application, the same code should actually behave as a six workers?",
            "Yeah, it's a good question. At the moment, it doesn't match the the fingerprint design yes for example. If everything has to be sent to the same client, maybe we can think about some work around but I think that in in in your example you want to send different language streams to different client., at the moment, it's not supported in this kind of design. I'm sorry.",
            "Yeah. Okay. That's alright. So with this is something that we should keep in mind, and discuss how to what what is the best solution. And primary we need to have these multi target systems. Yeah, Okay. So. That was my question. And another question was that what there are some useful tools within your platform or whatever for for long run testing. So if we have some., some worker, like our machine translation worker, or our ASR worker.. How do we tested so that it doesn't have any memory leaks and and things like that, whether you have some some like small scripts that do the testing. This this could be useful as well.",
            "I have to ask. But I think that we haven't tools like this one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can check it.",
            "Yeah. It could be some very simple things like feeding that feed something there, but yeah.",
            "Usually we prepare our client, let's say in order to perform such kind of test. But is something we use just once and we drop it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah. So. If if there is anything, just, please added to this document. Yeah. Then I've recorded here in the notes that the platform distinguishes the batch and online processing mode. We'll definitely use the online mode, and possibly also the batch mode, and ORGANIZATION6 will probably use only the online mode. And I also like, in in bold words I said there should be no practical limits in the batch mode.. Yeah. But this. But this was not really tested. Right?",
            "Right. Actually we have worker to work in real time. But I don't know if in the provide example there something serious about these kind of usage.",
            "Long term.",
            "The client example.",
            "Also has switch we can help you to emulate real time streaming starting from an audio file. And this should work but I haven't tested in the last week, sorry.",
            "Yeah, okay. So this is very good to know. So so the default mode for the client fo So this is now it's hopefully shared you all hopefully start looking at the ORGANIZATION7 document where I'm at,. I've put here the two specific pieces of code that you mentioned for the clients. The best example is the client, right? Is it the right one?",
            "In my opinion it's the more complex, but the more complete example client.",
            "Yeah. It's I think it's the one. It's I'm just highlighting it. You agree that this is the one, it should be shared on your screen?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah,, and and the default mode for this is the online, or the batch one?",
            "Oh, it has a lot of a common line parameter. It doesn't fault mode.",
            "Okay.",
            "Today we have gone through the the simpler example, but you can try to verify all the possible options. Are well commented it also has aaa. And okay. You should find all the required information.",
            "Yeah., and and it should also have an option to simulate live streaming from an audio file. not tested recently. So this is something that we should test. And this would be the best way for the testing actually, so that we connect such a bit direction a clients, to the the running mediator and test how our ASR and machine translation systems behave. Yeah. Okay, and the most complete example for the workers is this backend ASR too. As you mentioned.",
            "Actually, it's my favorite example. But also you have machine translation example. The audio record example. Okay. We send it out of indication but it's the same.",
            "Audio recording example. Okay. Yeah, so. That's that's it. I don't know I don't know if there are any further questions or comments from anyone else. I'll try to record briefly record what we have discuss about the the channels and recording and time stamps. I hope that I'll be able to recollect. But this is anyway something that ORGANIZATION6 needs to discuss directly with, with ORGANIZATION4. And please everybody attend to the to the requests, the like,, the details and whatever whatever else is needed. So if if that is all. Nobody has any other questions or comments? Okay. If everybody is fine. Then I would like to thank everyone for, participating in the session. I'll try to record. I'll try to extract the recording from this system, and also to to provide you with with the recording so that, maybe other people who didn't have time to, to attend now can can review the tutorial given by PERSON15 and, and sh and follow the, the instructions to, to get the clients and workers running and connecting. Okay?",
            "Okay. Thank you, thank you so much for listening me.",
            "Thank you and will be in touch with all the individual details. So thank you. Bye-bye.",
            "Bye.",
