            "PERSON2 is not coming?",
            "Oh, PERSON2 joined.",

            "Oh, yey.",
            "Since.",
            "List maybe.",
            "Yeah, anyway was just lying down I can hear. I'm getting bored actually now. My mom is not letting me do anything. So.",
            "Stay in the, stay in the bed and relax. It's important. To stay healthy.",
            "Yes. To, PERSON4 do you have anything specific to discuss today?",
            "Not very specific I wanted to thank you for preparing this ORGANIZATION2 forms for alignment annotations. It's very useful and pleasant to use actually. To have all this spreadsheet with all the annotators that download their data there, it's very nice. Really having overview for what was done. And I can answer them, it's really nice.",
            "Ok, so PERSON4 I was like looking through the task that we need to do. As specifically I need to do very quickly for the like for the workshop proposal.",
            "Yes.",
            "And here it seems to be mimi. So, so let me just quickly give you an overview. That what, what we have to do very quickly is we have to set up the website now. So, I have connected to the person whom PERSON6 reffered. And he reverted to me back with a link and say that you can do it there. So I'm get to see that how it looks like to do with the ORGANIZATION1, website. What I was wondering like if we can quickly do it on a Github or something. I do not know, like how much it time will take to do with the ORGANIZATION1 website?",
            "It may be similar. I do not know either. Should I ask PERSON6? I have no experience with that.",
            "Okay, okay. So, let me first look into that, like, how does it works, to do with and something. Because I'm not very experienced with those technologies. So I have to see, but if it is, if it is tough, I would not do. Do it in Github and do it very quickly.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like do much more timing to, into these things.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, yeah. So one thing is setting up the website, but the website should have, the content like, the call for participations.",
            "So the website of, the, of the, of the special event.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "So it will contain the call for participation. The program committee. The dates and the submission information type in the review process, location and stuff. So these are easy to do. Like but we have to write about the call for participation. So I will like start writing them here today. But I was requiring your input. Like, let me write it first version, and then, like maybe you, PERSON2 and PERSON6 should comment on that.",
            "They comment to that, of course.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Of course we will comment on that, yes.",
            "Yeah, sure. Ok. So after this is done then at the same time PERSON4 I will also ask you PERSON4 and PERSON2. Please try to invite people for like reviewers for the share task. So. Yeah, so I will share with both of you a e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to.",
            "I don't know. I don't have any, I don't have any connections in this summarization field. I'm new there.",
            "No, no, not require, not require PERSON4, not require to like only for summarization, ok?",
            "But how.",
            "We have to show we have a good program committee. So I think you already. You already brought the.",
            "Not summarization people.",
            "Like no one is going to check, you know. So that's it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "They will know that they are good, but at the same time they will not know that they are summarization people. I don't know.",
            "So you have already brought three people, right? As participants. So even big and like agree to do review at least one or two papers.",
            "Well, they are okay, maybe. Okay.",
            "You can just ask them, because eventually, like finally, it depends on how many papers we are getting. And, like. And then we can invite more people based on how many papers we are getting, okay? So that is requirement, but for in the website we have to show at least, I will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee.",
            "More than 20 people in the program committee.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes. So like we have many good contexts, like, for example, from ORGANIZATION1 only we can have two or more than three or four people. Excluding as the organizers. So one could be, you might know someone. So yeah.",
            "Hm-hm.",
            "And so let us let me write the draft e-mail and share it with you. So I think this can be done easily. And yeah. So can you open that particular doc that I shared about inter.",
            "This overview? Overleaf.",
            "Not overleaf. ORGANIZATION2 doc. Ok, let me share it with you again.",
            "Yes, thank you.",
            "Hold on. Okay, so this is no correct thing. So I, I just shared at the Zoom chat.",
            "Oh, does not work.",
            "Which one?",
            "No one. Just ORGANIZATION2 Docs is kind of it does not work today.",
            "Oh, why is it?",
            "Just ORGANIZATION2 today is busy. It happened to us already, once with PERSON6 now. Just it does not work. I do not know. I can 't open it.",
            "How can I help you?",
            "I don't know, but PERSON6 told that today ORGANIZATION2 doesn't work.",
            "Yes, I can also see that. It's not working.",
            "Yeah. Somehow. So what I already opened, it works. But the new ORGANIZATION2 documents are, so don't work. So I should download it, it doesn't work.",
            "Okay, anyway. So let me tell you briefly. So the thing is like a for the website we need this thing to be ready. And like we have to have the membership. For that I have mail to professor PERSON1, I guess. So, he is yet to respond back that we should do the individual membership, or we should do institutional membership so that we have to know what to do. And yes. So these are the, like, immediate pending task for preparing the proposals.",
            "I think I 'a little bit lost and. What was the last information I.",
            "Yeah, so we have to also like get the membership right. So for that, I have mail to that.",
            "Aha, okay, I see on my, ok.",
            "And I was looking at the, into some challenges of for the last year and their websites. So we are going to like make that similar to them. Like the content.",
            "Yes and. Yeah, I think that is it.",
            "Oh, okay. So what does it mean for us? Read your document and then we will see. Yes? Wait for trust.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok.",
            "Wait for the draft and, yeah. So I will send you the email draft to themselves. And maybe like, I will also copy on to it so that he can also invite some more people into the program committee.",
            "Definitely, definitely copy to PERSON6. Because, yes he is the person who could have know about somebody.",
            "Right. Okay, so this is it. It seems a lot of work to do. For this.",
            "Yes.",
            "For this workshop thing. Because, you know, like, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from. So and I think none of us are from someization background. So.",
            "Yes.",
            "We have to work extra hard.",
            "Yes. None of us from. You're also, you're also not from the summarization background?",
            "No.",
            "Aha.",
            "Yeah. So that is, anyway, I did not thought like, like making a share task would be that much challenging.",
            "Well, I that it is challenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that. I think you manage it.",
            "Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing some workshops with. But thing is that there are like, like, the organizing committee is very big. And so all of us are doing some, some, some portion, ok? But I, like I am mostly looking into the like publicity and the website. For that. And also a bit on writing the paper for that, but I did not like, share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.",
            "Yes.",
            "And the thing is like for us full legit workshop we don't have content. You know. So that is why we have to focus on.",
            "Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input. We have just the results of the experiment.",
            "Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization. So that they could can think of many content. We are just focusing on only one data, right. Like only one aspect of summarization.",
            "Yes, well, actually this discussion makes me totally frustrated. Because originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task. It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results. Now we make a scientific workshop. We need invited speakers on the topic and articles on the topic. I really, I can 't help beat frustrated how it is it is possible to do. But you are and PERSON6 are optimistic. So, why not.",
            "Yeah, I think like, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific. Because we do not really have content for the workshop.",
            "Yes, yes. But it is also actually not a workshop it's a satellite event. At the satellite event maybe.",
            "Right, right, that's the exact word. Not call it a workshop.",
            "Yes, let's not call it a workshop. Yes, let's call it an event.",
            "And for the like speakers also like we have to invite some for the input. Because we have to some like prominent people in summarization. For like for some other topic. So, but like they did not like, they didn't like responded affordably so they were actually not available.",
            "So you address somebody?",
            "Yes, yes, many, me and PERSON6 we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.",
            "Aha.",
            "But they are very, like they are very famous professors, including PERSON3, and.",
            "And they did not answer?",
            "No, they did answer, but they said, they were very busy.",
            "But what?",
            "They said they were very busy.",
            "All of them answer that they. So everybody declined.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Aha, ok.",
            "But the thing is that we to like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know. If we could have reached out to some early career people that would have been great from summarization. But anyway, we have to think of who has already worked on summarization. So for that, I will talk to PERSON6.",
            "I do not know anybody. I really do not know at all this earlier at all. Maybe could know somebody.",
            "Yeah, maybe.",
            "You didn't ask him.",
            "No, I 'going to ask him to be a part of the program committee because he declined to be a part of the organizing committee.",
            "I'm going to ask him to be part of the program committee.",
            "Yeah, is definitely a good idea. He should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee. Probably he could know somebody for keynote. So from this media generations so, little bit younger, say.",
            "So in this regard. But feel ORGANIZATION3 is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "As a, as a what? What?",
            "As a does it make sense like someone from ORGANIZATION1 to deliver the keynote? I do not think so. Because we are part of the organizing committee right?",
            "I do not know. So if it is somebody, why not if it could be, if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic, but I do not know the person. I do not know who could have this talk.",
            "Um-hum. Yeah, right.",
            "As I think about summarization, I knew just a couple of very young students who began to do the year. My gisters work on Phd. Actually I do not know about senior people for just summarization.",
            "Yes. And that too in terms of speech, not really text. So let me ask, let me ask PERSON6.",
            "Should I, should you, do you want to ask him now?",
            "I can e-mail him or how do you propose to ask him?",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Ok.",
            "No, he's in the next room.",
            "Oh, ok.",
            "In the office.",
            "So if he is available maybe he can, would he be able to join? Or maybe.",
            "I will ask him. I will ask him. As you say, as you. As you tell.",
            "I think just let me.",
            "Ok, let, write him an e-mail, yes.",
            "Ok, so I will do that. Anything else PERSON4? We are going to discuss?",
            "No, I think no. This proposal isn't important. It doesn't have sense to thing about to discuss summarization.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.",
            "I think you're totally busy with this topic now.",
            "Yes, I try to figure out what are the other things that we need to take care of.",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok, anything else? PERSON2 do you want to like share or we can drop for today.",
            "I think we can drop. PERSON2 should stay in bed.",
            "Yes, take rest.",
            "Yeah, take rest.",
            "Exactly.",

            "Perfect.",
            "Yes, we can hear you.",
            "Yeah, that's good. So I'm curious, if PERSON3 is here, we don't have PERSON3. Okay, that's too bad. And but we have PERSON7. That's good. And, we have PERSON12, PERSON16, PERSON10. And, also PERSON24, yeah. So I would like to hear primarily from the people that I haven't really talked to. For a while. So that's PERSON24 and PERSON16. And then the rest of you. So PERSON24 if you could start.",
            "So basically, I'm a bit, I get stuck with those experiments, because I had notable problems with how to run it at all with explayable mistakes. But finally, I managed to run.",
            "And currently I'm I started running those experiments that PERSON12 told me a while ago.",
            "So what are they?",
            "To run the same set up PERSON12 ran for that test part on other parts.",
            "Okay. And it's multi source or is it only the baselines?",
            "It is only the baselines.",
            "Yeah, it is it is to complete the GPU test and to know that one version, one new version of PROJECT3 really, really works. And it trains on floating point FP 16.",
            "So after we done this, then we will know which version of PROJECT3 we will for the use.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so you are doing it in FP 16, in the half precision, right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay, that run on tesla GPU use, for a comparison. Okay. So, that's good that you're finally starting. I'm a little worried about the multi source status for the deliverable. So, is there any chance that we will have. So what, PERSON24, have you contributed to the deliverable in any way? And this is also a question on PERSON12. Like in the deliverable. What is missing there? What is, what is really outstanding, what are the problems that we have not like.",
            "I'm waiting for the input from ORGANIZATION1. He promised it by Thursday.",
            "Then, then I only need to finish the executive summary. And maybe, maybe one comment from you. On PERSON25's paper and then.",
            "An overall, does it look reasonable, or are we do we have a problem with not enough progress in multi-source?",
            "I hope it's reasonable.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I explain that we don't have much progress with multi-source because we first need the data. The interpretation corpus.",
            "Yes, okay, that's good. So you are moving it to the wri to the spoken multi-source like explicitely.",
            "Yes.",
            "We could have done the multi-source research also in the text domain. And there that was also like of interest. And actually, the, yeah. So that's, the one of the reviewers in the review also ask whether we are, combining, the, the document level aspect with the multilingual aspect. And I answered that yes. There is like nothing against that. And the all the corpora that we are collecting are document level if we can have them like that and they are as multilingual as they are. So, still it would be useful to replicate. So, so, so read with the multi-source experiments on some larger text, text only data. So that's something that PERSON24 really, should work on, after this baseline. So, do we have a corpus, like that. So who all has played with, multi-source text based data? It was PERSON13 as far as I remember. You, PERSON12 played with the Window, approach. But you never got to multi-source yet, right?",
            "And then it was the experiment by PERSON26, which are covered there wheter like small data only and your monkey only.",
            "Yeah, we can use the text from ORGANIZATION6.",
            "So that's the transcripts?",
            "Yes, and translations.",
            "Yeah. So, I really think that some experiments with multi-source text, in ORGANIZATION6 should be done immediately after.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or actually concurrently with what PERSON24 is doing at the moment, right?",
            "But I've, I suppose, that text multi-source is not a challenge. Because the text are all already very, very disambiguate. So that only one source will be better than two sources. So that's my assumption.",
            "So sorry, what you are, you're saying that there is no gain to be expected, from multi-source, right?",
            "Yes. Contexts.",
            "Does not really expect any gains from multi-source. Okay, we'll see. We should, we should really test this. I agree that with the long written sentences, it is possible that you're right. And that the spoken language, is more ambiguous and therefore the, the multi-source is more likely to help. But we don't have numbers for that. It is should be tested empirically. So, so PERSON24, I think we need to have a separate call with you and PERSON12. And when could that happen? So, so that we would like double check the exact plans and look under your finger. So to say what you are working on at the at this moment and what else you could start to experiment with the multi-source. So when you two would be available for the separate call? What whatever, tomorrow? Or at what tomorrow afternoon work for you? PERSON24 and PERSON12?",
            "Yes.",
            "At what time tomorrow?",
            "Just say something, so whatever two, two pm or three pm?",
            "Yes, it work for me.",
            "Three thirty?",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's fine for me. Yeah. And for PERSON12 it's okay, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so great. Well, I'll send a link, later. But, I'll definitely plan it to the calendar, for you. That's, that's great, okay. Thanks. And in the meantime, we got the PERSON3. So it's the, now it's the good point to mention the two biggest things. And, the one of the biggest thing is that PERSON10 is leaving, which is listed at the end of the, at the end of the, of the notes for today's call. So, PERSON10 is already hopefully in touch with, everybody, who is getting some of the PERSON10's original tasks. So, PERSON10 himself will finish the language model checking of ASR outputs. That is text only check if the words kind of make sense. So then we would have a monitor, live monitoring of whether the ASR is producing something sensible or whether something is terribly wrong. Such as wrong language chosen for the wrong chanel. And once this is finished by PERSON10 it shoul be integrated somehow. The integration will probably already be more on PERSON8 and PERSON3. And with PERSON8 and PERSON3, PERSON10 will synchronize about the tools that, that PERSON10 has developed. And that PERSON8 should incorporate. And, PERSON3 should regularly use. Right? So have you already agreed on some date for this? I've seen PERSON8 here and he disappeared at the moment. So, PERSON3.",
            "Not exactly but I'll probably be in touch with PERSON10 or some sometimes early next week. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That would be somewhere on tuesday or wednesday.",
            "Yes, so the sooner the better. Because, like he will be leaving and, it's, yeah, things will only get harder. So actually, I was confused. That the PERSON6, here on the call, is not PERSON10, right? As the.",
            "No. It's the other one.",
            "The other one, yeah. Okay, yeah. So I was confused because PERSON10 said that he could be late for the call and that's probably happening. So please be in touch with PERSON10. Then, if the other PERSON6, who is on the call, can you hear us? PERSON6? So I'm not sure, if the call.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, that's good. Yeah, so I've, have started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you have reminded PERSON3 that your, profanity filtering is not yet integrated. And, I think this is also an important message for PERSON8 who has disappear again from the call. So the important message is that, yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated and everybody should do so. And at the same time, we need to have the set up so that you can actually integrate and tested yourself. So I call it like self or do it yourself integration. So PERSON3, when working with PERSON8 and when, when, like documenting what the set ups are, make sure that it is tested well enough by colleagues such as PERSON6, or then even PERSON10 for the language model checks us and everybody else. So whenever someone develops a new useful component. The full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily. So he can test it himself. So this do it yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will remain on you PERSON3. And you don't want to be overloaded. So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first, testing approach. Which has been already done. PERSON6, right? The profanity filtering, has it been tested on locks? I think it was.",
            "Yeah, it was tested on something.",
            "So now, now it's the time to test it on the life pipelines. And again. I think it's better if, PERSON3 explains to, to PERSON6 how to do it. So that PERSON6 runs it for himself. Using some of the workers and life playing some of the problematic files. Like, using MPlayer, or whatever simply play them, follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works. Because only when doing the real setup. The true errors were will appear. Like it's important to first debugg it using the lock files, and then it's important to debugg it in the pipeline. And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component. Here, in this case, PERSON6, it would be most efficient for all of us. So, so, PERSON3, please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do it yourself integration.",
            "Yeah, I do. Also, I have a call with PERSON6 later today.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, we will discussed exactly with PERSON6 that we have that and if he couldn't the local copy on his laptop because. But I think we get on to bad he can simply download the files on the oval machines.",
            "And then using files or something else he can tolerate the files, oh, to his local machine.",
            "Or he can also use X2Go. So he also has a chance to use X2Go.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's also very well. But since his intent of bandwidth is very limited.",
            "So oh.",
            "He prefers to download things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, yeah. Yeah. Do whatever works for you. I know it's, it's complicated. Okay. So speaking of the profanity filtering, and especially the spasm detection and removal. We have seen during the last sessions that the new ASR, the end to end ASR, E2E ASR, also suffers from the spasm issues. So the profanity filtering should really be, employed twice on each path. First after the ASR and second after the MT.",
            "Okay, yeah. But the. Were there instances of spasm coming in? Let's one language stream only? Because.",
            "They're already in the ASR language. Already the English contains contain suddenly something like, oh, oh, oh and there were full stop after every Oh. So it was actually for a second, PERSON12 saw that I think, for a second, the incoming, sentences were like flooded with lots of oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And then they disappeared again.",
            "Oh, yes, yes. So, I don't think we need to fold proprietors spasm removal, because if we remove the one from the ASR itself.",
            "Nothing is getting past to that MT worker, so.",
            "Yeah, but the MT worker can create its own spasm for good ASR.",
            "Oh, yeah. Me and that also.",
            "Yeah, so. I think two are, needed. Okay, so there was, there was the self or to do it yourself integration. And. Yeah, you are, so PERSON3, you have the call with, PERSON10 later today. So, that would be on the dashboard and the monitor. And hopefully PERSON8 will be there as well. So are you also in touch with PERSON8?",
            "Not right now, but I will after this call.",
            "Yeah, please join. He disappeared. So please make him joined to that. Then another thing that PERSON10 is passing over to others is the PROJECT2 check ASR. And PERSON1, will get this from him so that we have, so repeat has PROJECT2 baseline for his own experiments, right? Is that correct?",
            "Oh yes, yes.",
            "Okay. And the domain adaptation saw the daily. So the regular preparations for every session that will unfortunately land on PERSON3 only. So PERSON3 this is another thing that you need to discuss with PERSON10. Maybe that is the main subject of your call today, right?",
            "Oh, I haven't plan the call with PERSON10. I have a call with PERSON6.",
            "Okay. Yeah.",
            "As MT profanity filtering.",
            "Okay, okay. So I'm confusing the PERSON6 even though, okay. But anyway, this domain adaptation that will land on you. So, when you have a call with PERSON10, then PERSON10 has already started, preparing for the upcoming Monday seminar that's going to be given by, Italian guy, a famous one, the author of PROJECT1, actually. So if you are curious about that, it's it's interesting to see it, he'll be talking about verb frames. And, we should again get ready for that with some domain adaptation. So PERSON10 has probably started, but he should walk you through that thing. So that you can do it yourself next time. And it should be as automated as possible. Yeah. And the last bit is the multi-accent English. So the English, which is robust to the various speakers. So, on Monday we will hear the Italian English and yesterday, we had a chance to hear the Japanese English and the ASR was really struggling with that. So, that's, yeah, we really need to adapt. But this, this is mainly on PERSON1. Yeah. So, that was.",
            "Can I can that the accented English one to caught.",
            "Yes.",
            "I like the idea, and. I mean, I really like to see how it plays out.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. So just make sure to be in touch with PERSON1. So, PERSON1, please include PERSON3 in this part as well. So whenever you have like whatever tasks that PERSON3 can help with, then work on that jointly. So for that, I think that PERSON1 is now mentioning in his report here. The recording segmentation is that the thing that you are, the is it really? So what do you mean by recording segmentation. That's the short question, PERSON1.",
            "I mean they're cutting the recordings to words and done getting together to create a new, new, new recordings with, different sentences.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, so for the multi-accent English. So we are now with PERSON1 putting that, together to, just one. One technical solution. The current idea that better is working on is that he will create new sentences by concatenating words that were spoken in other sentences. And he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi speaker, sentences and, therefore, the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. So that's, that's one particle experiment. And later on, we, we may, do something more about, the, the multi accent things. So this, these new sentences will, it will actually try to solve two problems with one, one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And, we are going to create new sentences by from text only language model by adding the sound part to that. So that's, the language model will be better by that. For the ASR and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. Yeah. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was like during the training. They were dropping out, a time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So they were training on disruptive inputs, and that also greatly improved the robusteness of the system.",
            "If I'm, I'm not sure how they apply it. But, I think that the pipeline, the training pipeline, which is used for training of the that uses this same technique. So, it's already.",
            "It's already there. Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So that's. This is very important to know which all bells and whistles are available in which toolORGANIZATION1. Okay. So that is, that was the, like news and work that is being put on you, because PERSON10 will be leaving. And another, like a long term, or as well as a short term pile of work has arrived, because of the two sessions that we had. So, I would really like to ask everybody to record the experience from the ORGANIZATION7, and as the one sessions. And also, PERSON8 is not here. Also the there is one more lesson that we have like harshly learned yesterday, when. And the pipeline had to be started by PERSON10 and PERSON8. And unfortunately they failed. So, so, we still are totally relying on one person who is able to start the pipeline, and that is a bad situation. So, PERSON3, this is this is mainly on you and also on PERSON18 and PERSON8. To, like make sure that the whole set up is understandable and regularly tested by others in the team. And the do it yourself integration would help with that actually. So the system needs users, and the more diverse users, the more different users, the better. Because it will be robust to the different conditions of the users. And the yesterday, PERSON8 knew in principal what to do. He managed to get the ASR running and presented. But the rainbow worker was stuck for while. Then it was restarted by PERSON14 PERSON2, in Edinburgh. And then it, we were not able or PERSON8 was not able to properly use it. So the language is were swaped there and some of the languages didn't contain any reasonable output. Just some language coats instead of the output. So, it's to for agile and did respect. And, PERSON3 and PERSON18 please be in touch with PERSON8 and propose some solution. So that we are much more robusst even to individual persons not being available, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I actually, I have a call just and while, I saw word checks e-mail regarding the girls.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That he got rolled in the pipe and I kind of had a talk, call with him right at the moment, when I was free. And acting. We just not sending them in the mediator.",
            "So that was kind of creating, errors. Yeah.",
            "So, obviously he didn't know enough about the architectures.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "He didn't know where to look and what to check. So, yeah. So this is something that it should be like more self explanatory. And, well, better documented. So that, people would be able to get it running. So PERSON18, you were during that time you're in some different lecture or, because at some point I suddenly saw that like PERSON8 stopped trying, maybe. Or maybe he was trying, but without any success, I don't know.",
            "No, I actually, around like two pm. We were having a call. And I was spending him through the pipelines that escaped like, what does each block, what exactly does and how to debugg? So I explain him. Now you are getting this errors how to debugg what section is exactly the hair issue with so first tribe with the ASR of then try with the itself, try individual ASR and things like that. So, he was able to understand. But yeah, because it would not be a surprise if PERSON8 failed, because he was time for the first time.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, the pipeline is pretty complicated for someone who has seen it for the first time too.",
            "Yeah, but I was surprised that like the pipeline, because it was the same pipeline that the pipeline.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Couldn't be simply. But why did the fingerprints then change?",
            "No, the fingerprint was still the same, but the worker was not running.",
            "But when the workers started running, it didn't work. That something which I don't understand.",
            "Maybe it's because of second. Or have you seen the common addresses file to include PERSON5's army worker.",
            "No we have a separate directory for that.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "This is kind of again. You know, I mean a bad thing that, if we want to implement PERSON5's worker, we need to have a separate descript. This is kind of bad.",
            "This is very bad. Yes. Exactly. This is very bad. So it. So please, you three, make a call pre like set up a call with PERSON8. It's a pity he is not here at the moment. And, discuss how this should be done. Because PERSON8 is now, after his experience, he is working on like, how to make the configuration cleaner. So, please discuss this with him very carefully. So, next week, I would like to hear from you three how far you got in the in the like specifications of the requirements. So to say. So, there is. Coach. Been. So, I ll put it here. PERSON15 asks PERSON8, PERSON18 and PERSON3 to have a call and provide the first specification of requirements, for a pipeline set ups. So that, it is much less error prone and a more modular. Easy. EG easy to integrate, also the profanity filtering. PERSON16. Rainbow worker and so on.",
            "PERSON16, I also like to I also like to request you. So you have multiple scripts that start the that starts you avanti and workers, which is like a multi-edr and multi bigger and multied relevant. So this is kind of confusing for, I guess, I know, each of these scripts. But then the new people did not know. So maybe if you could remove these scripts which have the similar performance, or only leave that which is usable and which is kind of okay for the for our life sessions.",
            "Can we maybe? I can maybe make it so that there is one script, because.",
            "With different parametres.",
            "Yeah, with different parameters. Because basically before this structure was like for the. Oh, actually, workers for the English to Czech model.",
            "Which also uses tensor to tensor, so it uses the same structure. But, yeah, so maybe I could add some parameters, for example, to limit the number of languages.",
            "Exactly.",
            "And also to, yeah, for some switch for the for the which model to use. But is it possible to pass these parameters to can I assume when you, when you were it on cluster.",
            "Oh, sorry. So suppose like, if you have one worker, which emits all the languages. I mean, it's up to us, we can control how many languages we want to see the subtitling platform. It's completely up to us. But if you think that when starting the worker, if you limit the parameters, if you limit the number of languages there itself. And if you think that it improves the maybe I don't know, maybe speed. So then I think we should go for that.",
            "Yeah, so. That's a good question on PERSON16. PERSON16.",
            "Is, is it better to run the multi lingual moral with fewer languages enabled? I don't think it is any saving?",
            "Well, we did it actually, when we were testing it. I think we did it with PERSON12. If I'm not mistaken. When we were testing a reef PERSON18, when we were testing it on. I don't remember where, where it was. I.",
            "I think it was.",
            "It was the.",
            "It was the.",
            "It was not. It wasn't a hackathon.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah exactly. And. So. PERSON6 at a performance stable constructed with the PERSON14's rainbow worker and PERSON5's rainbow worker. And comparatively, PERSON14's rainbow worker were a better, were better side.",
            "So also. All the rules of speed. PERSON14's rainbow worker was better in speed, but was it better in bless course?",
            "Not to speed. I mean, overall, it was blows. Course was were better for fulfills were okay.",
            "So then the, there is actually no point in having PERSON16 rainbow worker in the pipeline at the moment, right?",
            "But, but.",
            "Yeah. I think. Yeah.",
            "If, well, for a fall back solution, it's important like remember during the ORGANIZATION7. We didn't so. Yeah, exactly. We need to have it.",
            "Yeah, but still, basically, yeah, yeah, there are still basically like two things that are bad with the model. One thing is that it wasn't train trained with the fine tunings that feel used, such as using partial sentences and other stuff. And the other problem is that it was basically trained using tensor to tensor, which makes it very, very slow. So that's why we used the subset of the languages, because then, like then, it could work real time. But otherwise that there was quite a big delay like two seconds to translate something.",
            "Maybe this is a stupid idea. But what I think is that if we could have like multiple word, multiple, multiple replicas of your same workers, and, each emitting, a different subset of languages.",
            "Yes, that could be as fall back solution. But the main question is, how come that it's slower with more languages. Like, I don't see that because it should be paralyzing when your.",
            "Yes, so there are maybe like forty languages, so there are forty, like the big size is forty.",
            "Yes.",
            "And for back size for it, it is actually a lot slower than for back size eight, for example.",
            "Okay, so that is very strange. This is something that I would not have expected, because it should be running in parallel, right?",
            "Yeah it. It is somehow PROJECT3 is better optimised, so.",
            "So maybe like for a better solution. I would probably. Yeah.",
            "Still, I think that.",
            "Use PROJECT3, yeah. Yeah.",
            "So I suggest that we do not use PERSON16 tensor to tensor worker at all for the live sessions. It is good, maybe, for creating the syntethic data or whatever. But. As the fall back solution, we should have the PROJECT3 models running as a worker on our side. So, we should be able to launch rainbow worker from PERSON14 on our cluster.",
            "Yeah, for that, I think I located the directory on. Well, we have the code for that. I think PERSON18 had copied from PERSON14.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I got the directory for it, and I will start looking into it.",
            "So, sorry, I missed that. So are you going to do that, right PERSON3? Correct?",
            "Yes, yeah, I'm going to look into it. PERSON18 mentioned that he when he tried that failed because of some medows that he does recall right now. I'll see what errors are those, and.",
            "Get in touch get in touch with PERSON24 and others. So actually all of you I suggest that all of you are on the devel at ORGANIZATION5 mailing list. And let's use this mailing list for these technical issues like getting PROJECT3 running. I know that it will it will flood the list also for others who are working other things. But this is so like low level issues, that it's worth having this discussion in the devel at ORGANIZATION5 mailing list. So.",
            "And also.",
            "Are you all in the list?",
            "I'm not sure if I am. I don't think I am.",
            "I think that I'm not either, but also, I am using the newest version of PROJECT3 actually to train the shortening models. So I have version one point nine comparates as well.",
            "So the devel, is or another option is to use. So the devel is really, I see its old people there. We have people like PERSON20 there, but we don't have you. So we could also use the PROJECT5 ORGANIZATION5 lists for that.",
            "And what's your issue with PROJECT3, can you repeat it?",
            "So actually, when I was working with PROJECT3 I had several like part conflicts. There were like chain of parts with which needed to be which needed to be fixed, and kind of unable to backtrack each of them. Yeah, so I, I, I never tried it, then.",
            "Do you mean path configs like, like, work paths for the PROJECT3 itself, or for the or in the model config.",
            "If you talk about learning PERSON14's model then PERSON14 send us some scripts with absolute paths on their systems, and we just need to replace them with our paths, correctly. And then hopefully it will work.",
            "Yeah, I can also try this if you send me the location of the models.",
            "Yeah, sure. I'll again find it and send it to you. PERSON18 can do that at me.",
            "Yeah. I'll follow you the even later. Okay.",
            "Something who else, who else should be? Yeah.",
            "I think you already have the email? PERSON16.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah, it's the subject is ORGANISATION4 rainbow audience. But, let me send you again with the part of the.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. Because I don't have the path, I think.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "So PERSON18 please send me on that e-mail as well.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so, so.",
            "So, so, use whatever a communication platform works for you. Like direct emailing is fine as well. Remember to that PERSON24 is also a source of information, because PERSON24 will now be fighting with that. And he'll be running into the same issues, and he has successfully fight it with PROJECT3 in the summer. So, he also has some pretty fresh experience. So it's PERSON24. The zimbra will autocomplete the, the, the email for you. And also, so if you do not know who could help you with what, email PROJECT5 dash ORGANIZATION5. And I'm just asking PERSON9 to add PERSON24 there. And I'll I'll make sure that you are there. Like all of you, who can possibly answer such questions are there. So let's let's use, PROJECT5 dash ORGANIZATION5, also for the technical issues. If you have if you random questions, ask around. Never wait. That's that's it. Never wait. Okay. So, I would like to hear from PERSON16 quick report.",
            "Yeah. So, right now, I am working on the shortening and extending models. And so I already have the first models, but now I'm trying to vary the amount of data and the length in the dataset, and to see, like, what is the difference in performance and length. And then when I'm happy with this, then I will get to the second phase, where I will basically translate and synte and creating to dig data from the rest of the and the end dataset, and then I will build like the final shortening model.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also, yes. So, here I actually run into one issue that basically I'm running out of storage quota.",
            "On levá strana.",
            "Yeah, so, just ask for more. So have an estimate, ask for more. That's it.",
            "So.",
            "So, so you just need to come up with a reasonable estimate how much more you need. So there they do have space, they only give it away only like after. They have seen that the people have thought about it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because the practice is that no one ever cleans up after themselves. So the only way to avoid an exponential growth is to make the growth modest and moderated.",
            "Yeah, okay, oh. And also, yeah, also, this is the problem with the ORGANIZATION8s one hundred language models, because they take like fifty gigabytes themselves.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, just answer.",
            "Okay.",
            "Keep it in the copy. Write an estimate. How much you need.",
            "Okay.",
            "To IT EDU.",
            "And do you, maybe know, like, how much space there is available on Troja because maybe I could save something there.",
            "Ask simply say what you need.",
            "Okay, okay. I will just added. Okay.",
            "They will, they will know what is better. And actually, it's since the better GPUs are on Troja. Having the data in Troja makes more sense.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "Okay, that's good.",
            "You can use Command DF and it will tell you the space on all the disk.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Or DF minus age for human redo. Okay, just I just I won't see the quota there.",
            "There is a command to check the quota.",
            "Yeah, write it into the document.",
            "Okay, okay, thank.",
            "So in the, I'll check what is called, yeah. So, oh yes, quota, so is it this one? Yeah. So are you used?",
            "Oh, that's a different quota. Okay, yes, agree. Yes, that's that's the command. Opt and a few tils?",
            "So I actually have an alliance for this. So, so.",
            "Okay. I see it now.",
            "When I type quota I, I get this. I get the output of this.",
            "Okay, so on Troja I have fifty gigabytes. Yeah, that's.",
            "That's too little. Obviously you can, you can ask for much more. Okay? That's good. So, is there anyone who should report some progress, and we have forgotten about him.",
            "Yeah, I actually have like one last thing.",
            "And basically, PERSON19 would like to.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yes.",
            "And he would like you to be participating as well.",
            "Yeah, so what are his confidence. And what are your confidence. Tomorrow afternoon, before the call that I have with PERSON24 and PERSON12, like tomorrow at two. Will that work?",
            "I think that would work for me, so I can write to him.",
            "So try, yeah, try that, because I'll have called at half past three with PERSON14 and PERSON24.",
            "Okay.",
            "Also PERSON15 and there is a guy here in, in Zabrican. He is only, he is almost completed done with his masters.",
            "He is an Indian guy and saw the data, it's his name and he mentioned that, he is actually interested to join your group, your team. Maybe it's a PSD or do that at full time job. And.",
            "To apply for PHD one deadline is very soon. It's the end of the year.",
            "Okay.",
            "It's a briefly the one. So he should check it's something like ORGANIZATION5 slash PHD.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he should email that he is interested, to send to PHD at ORGANIZATION5 and something like that.",
            "Okay, okay. I mention all. He also mentioned that. Because his master thesis is based on modern machine translation.",
            "But, he expressed his interest to join your group and he also mentioned that he had a discussion with you. I don't know about something during our debruity,",
            "Yeah, PERSON22, I don't remember so his name. Yeah, so. Yeah. So for PHD application, he should email that email PHD at ORGANIZATION5. And, I'm beyond my capacity, but others may have the capacity and for the general connection with PROJECT5. Yes, that's not dependent on that deadline at all.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that will work. So I'm trying. PERSON16, okay, yeah, yeah. So I'm for tommorow at two I'm trying to send a ORGANIZATION2 invite. So, that's probably edge and I want still. We are way beyond planned time. That's because we haven't had the call last week, unfortunatelly. So, I'm now highlighting the experience, from the ORGANIZATION7 and as you want again. I've already reminded everybody to record what you what you saw and also read what other has other have experience. But let's also discuss the lessons that we learned. And the immediate lessons and the to do list, are this. Yes, we absolutely need the evaluation of all systems, all files, in the test set. Like, in, PROJECT5 test set automated. So, how far is that? That's a question for PERSON3. Okay, yeah. Yeah, so, I have started finishing that today. By the end of the day, I'll be done with it. So I have a call at two thirty Prague time with PERSON6 to discuss some of the specifics of that is around the SLTS capability of downloading files. Do I need to do it manually. So, there are some calls to this. There are something calls PERSON6. And apart from that, the code is almost finished with that discussion. I think I'll be able to wrap it up today itself. So.",
            "Yeah, and we have PERSON7 on the call. So, PERSON7 will be the person who will pick this up from you. And Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "So are you also planning PERSON7 to be on that call with PERSON6, or with the PERSON3 after that?",
            "Which one is it? I'm sorry. I don't remember.",
            "I think I'll have a call with PERSON7 later. Because that specific is only lated to automating the ASR evaluation. Yeah, it's basically to generate ASR automatically. And if I evaluate the ASR given any index file. So what essentially my script will be doing is taking an input of taking the index file as an input and it will generate the ASR from whatever model there is mentioned in the script. And I'm trying to make it as well as possible, so that we don't need to hardcore the ASR in the script. We just choose that this is ASR I want to use. Same goes for, the MT models. But, yeah, essentially, it's that. So, after that I'll have a call with PERSON7 to discuss all the, oh, things that I put in the script, and then I think he can take it up from that.",
            "Yeah, okay. Yeah, idea is that once you evaluate exactly as flexible as you just describe it. Once you evaluate it, the outputs need to be stored somewhere, and the scores have to be stored somewhere. And PERSON7s know, PERSON7 knows where these things should be stored. So next time when you ask for the same thing like it. It could give you the cashed, output already. I think it could, because I think it's better to like have it, run again. But, and create one more entry. And if the entry is identical, then we. We're good. We know that nothing has the like worsened. But it. Then, without running anything, you should just be able to look at the stored outputs and the store scores, and it would immediately see where we are standing. So this recording of the results is something that PERSON7 will manage.",
            "Okay. So, PERSON3, let me know when you finish it, and we can arrange a meeting, and then I will look at it, and then I will write it into the deliverable. Yes?",
            "I think I will have I'll have call with you next week on my.",
            "Okay, okay, that sounds good. Okay.",
            "Yeah, great. Okay, so that was the first immediate lesson and to do that arose from the last week sessions. And the other one is the management thing. So, when there is some session happening, we really need to make sure that we have the important people around the globe, like available. So I've halfway asked if PERSON14 would be there. He didn't respond. And in the end he was not available. And a very similar thing happened also yesterday. During the, the call at three pm Prague time the two to UTC call. Again we were like chasing PERSON14 through a PERSON4 on PROJECT4. So it was, it was crazy. So, for this we need to know which components we are using and who are the people behind these components. And for important sessions we should secure that we have the people. So that's is like, a message for me but also for PERSON3. As a fallback solution, if I if I forget to make sure that we have these people available, or they do not know that they won't be available. It is also okay. So if we knew that PERSON14 is unreachable because he is traveling, or whatever. That can, of course, happen. But we need to know what to do. We need to know what is our fallback solution if that party is not present. And then we have the long term focus. And I would like. So, the things that I spotted that really need attention are these. And I would like to put your names next to those for your, to know that like you are the people who are long term, including this goal and this, this challenge in your plans. So this non native accent that's very critical. And here the person is PERSON1 and possibly PERSON3 to a little extent, right? Yes.",
            "Anyone else, anyone else can work on the non native accent think. Prob. Could be. My, well. Yeah, I don't know. Ok, then, another thing that I spotted is this is in the Monday test document. It's it's highlighted in four times highlighted. It's called Gazette years. So when some session is happening, we need the names, and terminology for that session. And we, need to collect it like prepare it, manually created somewhat. And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible. So there is, there is a certain like skill, behind that, that needs to be practiced. So I'm quite skilled in shuffling text files. And whenever I see you any of you doing that, then I, like, always have tips in my head that what could be done faster. Maybe it's not faster for you in the end, but at least you should consider it. So this skill is something that we need people to have. And, we need someone to be like responsible for that. And I, I 'afraid that the only person, for this could be PERSON3. If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation the data crunching please, say so. And then, we need. So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations. We need, techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems. So, my impression, from the, domain adaptation that PERSON10 has been carefully doing for all the sessions, was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR. So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday. PERSON10 is already starting the data collection. But I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in the PROJECT2 set up. So, maybe PERSON10 and PERSON3 because he is learning how to do domain adaptation. And PERSON1, because he is doing how to work with PROJECT2. If you three could, meet and double check what is PROJECT2 doing with the. It's not PROJECT2, actually. The domain adaptation is for the PERSON17 toolkit, right? Oh, yes, it is so.",
            "Yes, yes, yeah.",
            "So if you could, like somehow, the PROJECT2 will be similar. But we don't have that pipeline for PROJECT2 yet. But if you could like dig into the toolkit, and debugg whether it is actually getting the worst into that. So I know that PERSON10 has already thrived that once. Can you confirm that you are a hundred percent sure that the dictionary is well included. And the substitute words are for the language model are really used, and it's asking the correct anagrams with the substitute words instead of the new words. Can you confirm that this is really happening?",
            "The domain adaptation? I think so because, I think so, because we had, we were testing it with a non domain adapted model.",
            "And the domain adapted ones. And the domain adapted ones were capturing the domain related words much better than non domain adapted ones.",
            "Yeah, so if you have this great experience then, then maybe I'm wrong. But my impression was that it is not really not really, visible in the output. So please convince me idealy with outputs and also numbers that it's it's doing, the job.",
            "Okay, but for that, we will probably need of the transcribed. Like we need one of the Monday meetings transcribed.",
            "So the, for example, in PROJECT5 test set there is this Monday talk of mine. The, the everything can go wrong. That contains a fair bit of terminology.",
            "Yeah, we do board. Oh, okay, so. But our models, I'm not sure if we have the domain rapid model for that or not. But for sure, all we can test the latest one on that as well.",
            "Exactly, yeah, exactly. So this is like kind of backward looking, making sure that the old approach works the new data well. But then there is also one thing, and there is. At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR. So what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting, from sound. And some merging procedure. So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time. End to end ASR, which is better in general. And then domain adapted PROJECT2 set up, which is used only to spot the keywords. And when we see a keyword in the domain adapted version then we would then we would like use that sentence from PROJECT2, which is in general worse, but contents the right terms. So that's that's my like suggestion, what we could do. And another suggestion is that we really should have our arm fully new ASR and do various experiments on fine tuning and all that. So we've discussed this with PERSON1. P, PERSON1. And, PERSON1, is there any update from the potential, colleague or friend of yours.",
            "No, not yet.",
            "Yeah, so, if there would be anyone else, would be curious about this, please let me know. Or get in touch. So this is something which is, which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet. And that's the most, stringing the most urgent problem these days. So, we really could make a an impact there.",
            "Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about, like, what kinds of data we currently use for this. Because, because, for example, like, if you check, like, ORGANIZATION2's models on ORGANIZATION3 that they are like already pretty good at these things.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I think that if we, just like we could probably just steal the data from them. Because, because you have like a such a large, set of videos that basically with different domains and different speaker and speaker native languages on ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And like, I had this idea that we could just like, use some tool to the download basically these some kinds of filter and videos from ORGANIZATION3 and make your training tests, a training set out of them.",
            "Yeah, I agree, except we don't have the human capacity to do that. So, PERSON16 proposal, the scrape ORGANIZATION3 and even automatic.",
            "Yeah, and. And it's actually something similar to what basically the kind academic purpose was. If I. Make sense.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So maybe we could reuse actually what there.",
            "Yes, yes, that's true, so we need, we need colleagues for this. So if you, if you are, are in touch with someone such as PERSON1 is in touch with someone. Then. Yeah. So this is. It would be. Yeah, it would be great.",
            "Yeah, it's just an idea.",
            "It is so little chance here a little chance PERSON1's, friend, will help with this. Yeah, PERSON3 will evaluate. And then. Yeah, profanity and then the positive speak. So. I have some examples. And I've recorded them either in the Monday seminar document or maybe here in the ORGANIZATION7 as you want. That the ASR is sometimes, yeah. So one session was that at ORGANIZATION7. There was a debate whether languages, are the African languages will be supported by some of the European project. And the answer from the project, coordinator was that, well, we were discussing this a lot. And then, unfortunately, it's it's African, and we don't have capacity for that. But the word discussing was recognized as disgusting. And the translation was that, like we were disgusted by the idea of including African languages in our project. So even the word disgusting, which is not a bad word on his own, is very risky. So, we should, our profanity filtering should really be, aggressive about any slightly negative words. Right?",
            "Maybe, maybe I have idea here. Because I'm afraid that we cannot just aggressively removed these words, because there are many words that actually might harm someone, and especially these days. But maybe we, we could employ these neural networks that I forget how this task is called, but it's like based on the movie review.",
            "Yeah, sentiment analysis.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sentiment analysis. Well, maybe we can use some sentiment analysis to remove, sentences or some a group of words with a negative sentiment. Or something like that. Or adapted to some not actually negative sentiment, but rather some agressive sentiment. If we can retrains that in such a way.",
            "I have some experience with that.",
            "But it doesn't play well. Because ultimately, I mean, that s kind of very specific to a use case. So not exactly similar, but when I was working with the financial dataset that we had created, or in my previous work, so we were looking for things from, let's say, an investor's point of view, it was since it is related to sentiment analysis. That view is very subjective. So, even if you train a neural network model to a spot some, some of the things that might be disrespectful or demeaning to someone, or maybe that shouldn't be there. The including the subjectivity is pretty hard. Oh, it's a complete task of its own. So it takes a lot of work, it will probably take a lot of work.",
            "And maybe there are already some, some datasets, because, if I remember correctly. I'm the social media like ORGANIZATION8 or ORGANIZATION4 etcetera they, they actually use such things to filter the posts. Because they, they are obliged to filter some, some rasist and some bad statuses. So maybe they, they have created some, some of the tape of this.",
            "Yes, this is very true. There was actually a cable competition for this, where people had to make models to detect the tweets or like sentences which were harmful in some ways. And basically, if you just download some models from this competition. Then you will have a question fire that can classify basically this sentence is like hateful or like, there are, there are like five categories like fake news, hateful and I don't know like what. So definitely, you can use this for the task.",
            "Yeah, that's, that's good.",
            "I can send, send you the link.",
            "Yeah, please pasted document. But remember.",
            "Multi task of that.",
            "Yeah, but remember that our setting is slightly different from these competitions and also the yeah. The, the, the difference is that we do not expect the speakers to use this abusive language, or whatever you call that. So in our case, what we are after is more like sentiment inconsistency rather than bad sentiment. Because we expect these people to say only the nice thing. It's like official speeches. And the bad words arise only as errors of ASR and errors of translation. And that's a different setting. And I think that with in this different setting, the problem with the subjectivity that PERSON3 mentioned and I agree it's very important, but it may be less, less severe. So I think there it could work, but it could. We should probably train it differently to get the most of that.",
            "But also, if we detect, detect something using this, this model, then we can know that there was a potentially,",
            "Actually, I think it would make the task much easier, because since we are not expecting anything bad. So anything bad that is there can just be removed. I'm not sure how, how well it will perform. But, yeah, if it if it seems hateful in gender, we just remove it. Because we are not expecting the speaker to say. So, we know that if it's hateful, it's just bad. So we are not showing it. Yeah. So in other words, the ASR should make a different hypothesis. That's, that would be the idle behavior. Like that in your ear there would be this positive filter. You never. You would never ever understand the bad word at all.",
            "Yeah, something like that. I mean, we can just say in the profanity filter part, they can just look out for a hateful comments or hateful sentence, and we can simply remove it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It will be like a sentence was said. But it's not transcribed by ASR. It's not irritated actually transcribed, we will have it in our logs, but it won't be displayed on the subtitling platforms.",
            "Yeah. There will be like hidden.",
            "Yeah, so I see that as a great option for someone who would like to supervise a student. So it could be whatever PERSON12 or PERSON1, or PERSON16, I don't know if you have any stu. No, you don't have any. You're not. You don't have any bachelor students yet, because you're still studying from, right?",
            "I have some at fit. Who might be interested that.",
            "But yes, yes, that would be easier. We could. We could also then employ them easier because they're, they will be Czech citizens.",
            "Well, maybe I can ask my student, because we haven't agreed on the bachelors thesis.",
            "I think he should stay with the non native English accent.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Find another one.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we see, and again, like a good space for, for research. And the, here, the last item that I had on my list was shortening MT. And that's in PERSON16. So, PERSON16, but also. Who was that, who was that? The two more people, PERSON11, PERSON21. And then one more person was, was, somehow related to this task of shortening MT. I'll I'll think about that, working on that.",
            "All the ask one more thing. So for that task of, can I ask the elderly students who are already in Prague for the first or second year. If they are interested in doing that then, maybe since they will already be in Prague.",
            "And they were studying there.",
            "Yes.",
            "Is just it'll be equivalent as the other student.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I'll ask if one of them.",
            "For the positive speak, for the profanity filtering.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, please do. Definitely, that will be useful.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, well, so thanks a lot for your time. If you, I would still I like to ask you, please read the experience of others, record your experience from the most recent sessions. And also, if you are short of ideas read the problems in the Monday tests document. And if you spot any other ideas that I could be fruitful. Put them here. Let's. Let's discuss them next, next week as well. I'm happy to see that actually we have covered by someone, to some extent, these topics that I've found. But there's probably more and, yeah, we just need more people to do that. So, with that I would probably end. Is there still anything that we should discuss today?",
            "I don't have anything else. Okay, as well, other than like saying that my visa is a probably be in Prague in January.",
            "Yes, so that will be great if you finally make it. You'll be the first one who really makes it to Prague. Because people from, the others are struggling. So please do arrive here. That would be very, very useful. So we will have one more this call next week, and then, it will be already the Christmas Day and then, the New Year's Eve. So, two weeks of a break from these Thursday calls. And then on the 7th of January will meet again. So next week and then in January.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, thanks very much. To all of you for the attendance and for your patients. Patients. It was too long today and talk to you individually and also next week.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you, Bye, bye.",
            "Bye. Thank you."

            "Yes, I sent that email, and you were on the copy. Let me check.",
            "Oh I missed that too, sorry.",
            "Yes, at ten.",

            "He's in Prague.",
            "Yeah, ye well that's that's when he was in Prague.",
            "That's a photo.",
            "That is a that is a real photo, yes. That's when he was in Prague so it's it's. Yeah, hi PERSON7.",
            "Hi there.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so good to good to see you again, even, yes, you're now moving as well. Yeah.",
            "So PERSON1 has forwarded to me also the, the response that you gave to her previously. Too bad for us so it's like how much time do you do you have? Is this really zero, or is that.",
            "I can't this whole month, but it may be limited to, weekends or something like that, because, weekdays we'll be, fully, taken.",
            "And you're and you're physically in Iran, right?",
            "Yes, already in Iran, but for, a month or two.",
            "And then you are moving to Canada, or.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, so, yeah, also that could be difficult, but because we are we are failing to get our people here. So actually, PERSON9, what is what is the status of your, your coming over to Prague? Is there any chance, or what is what is the status there?",
            "I would only say that once the vaccination drive starts, then only like I would like, consider of, moving to New Delhi for the visa and stuffs, so yeah.",
            "Oh. So, you're an afraid to, to go to New Delhi, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so.",
            "Yeah that is.",
            "It's not really.",
            "Yeah, that is that is too bad. So I think we are, like technically, we are safe for the first few months of the year, but then the way in which we are paying you, the substitute way, has probably legal limits, which, will kind of run out, in the middle of the year. So that's my worry that like we were able to since you started in the middle of the, of the previous year, we could use like the full year limits for the half year or the less than half year of time. But now, if we wanted to pay you for the full year, the limits which amount to half a year, would not be sufficient.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's really, there is this hard constraints, which is lurking behind the corner. So we should really, like, even if it was for a short time, I think it's it's very important that you that you actually do come to do the paperwork, which cannot be done remotely. So, so please, like, do not think that the matter has been solved by you still, getting the money. It has it has been the problem has been postponed, but there is a limit on, how far we can push, this. And, we were lucky that you started in the middle of the year, so, so that went smoothly. But, we would not be this lucky this year.",
            "M-hm. Okay, okay.",
            "So, that's that's the that's the problem. Yeah I'm in the corridor, so that's why I took the face mask -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah ye I understand. So, so professor PERSON4, I think I think, yeah, let me talk to you regarding this sometime really.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah with, yeah. Okay, great.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So now, I'm I was kind of hoping that PERSON2, the student of mine would be able to join, but he didn't respond to my email, I sent him an email, three hours ago, if he would be available at this hour so it was, like late notice. And the I need to clarify his possible role there, he is not will not have the capacity to do the, the labor, so to say. Because he needs to finish like to do and write and finish his master thesis. He's doing it in a short period of time, like by his decision, but I support that, and the goal of the thesis is to develop the tool, which will help the annotations, but it's not to carry out the annotations, and not to like polish the data and like, manage the process of, de-identification. So we can only benefit in the way, that, his tool can be tweaked as we would like it to be, we can ask him for features, he will probably include these features and, and that would save our processes, then, but he is not going to handle our data, because that would be like I'm I'm not paying him on the project and, he is already being payed from, a company who also wants, who also want this tool, so, I don't think it would be a good idea, if we employed him on the project, because he would be effectively, he wouldn't have the time, effectively. So it would be only like, spending money on something which, he cannot provide anyway because time is limited. So, we are really short of a person, who would do, the thing that PERSON7 was, that I was hoping that PERSON7 would do. And that's the, preparation of the, files for annotators and then, the insertion of the annotations into the data set, and then, like polishing, cleaning up the data, so that it is all valid XML and all that, and doing the annotation preparation and annotation injection, or insertion, at the type level, as well as the token level, and then the final removal of the original content so that, we have, only the placeholders there and no longer the named entities. So this is what we need, and, like the you can spend the rest of the call talking about the, the procedure that we discussed yesterday, but I don't think there's any new input from me at this point. What I will try to do if, like. I don't think that PERSON7's weekends would be sufficient. Do you think that it would be, possible to do this, over the weekends, and, PERSON7 when you say this semester, does the semester start now, has the semester just started, or started or do you still have, two months, for example, to go?",
            "It is already started, my semester, winter semester.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I can do is, I can try, reaching out to, one, like, CS student, who is also remote and busy, that would be also difficult, and I can try to reach out to another faculty, where they also have, like student works and, maybe they would have someone available for this exercise. So that's, that's the only thing that I can, like think of. But, yeah, if it can easily fail as well, so. So the question is how to, how to proceed, short of people.",
            "So that we are going to do is just, insert the words that PERSON1 prepared, in the text, and polish it? Is that it?",
            "There is another phase, so this is the type level phase, so, that some of these, words are not named entities in any of the contexts, some are, named entities in all the contexts, and some of them, have to be decided by the by instances. So what we need to do is to, put this annotation into all the files, at the appropriate places and then we need to do the second round, which will be the same thing at the token level. So there again, there has to be some way, for the annotators to browse the instances of words, the undecided ones, and decide them. And, as I said yesterday, the s, it is okay to have uncertain information, like uncertain decisions about named entities in the data. So, it is okay to know that, this word is possibly a named entity and no person has looked at it yet. That is, okay. What is not allowed, is to have uncertainty about the status of the process. So we have to the XML has to be absolutely clear, in, the information, whether someone has looked at this or not, whether it has been processed at the type level, at the token level, or perhaps we will have some, other levels as well, as we as we browse through the data it is possible that, for example, the months, will be also like a special, level there. And, it is not to, like, if I said yesterday like, if I was the person to do this, then I would spend a, a week like, 40 hours working on this and I think it's it's doable in those 40 hours, if you are er skilled, VI user and programmer. But, I don't have this week, so we need to do it, with other, people. And, then we are at the problem, that you are, PERSON7, skilled in these processing tools, but you don't have the time capacity, and the annotators, don't have the programming skills, so they cannot automate their work. So that's the that's the problem that we are really facing.",
            "M-hm. What kind of a. In what format are we going to mmh, prepare for, the annotators? I mean the. I mean some for example, making them bold, make them making them bold or, add a parenthesis at after them, or something like that, or we need the graphical.",
            "Yeah, this is entirely up to us. So anything simple, that will work, simple for, us, as well as for them, is the way to go. So yes, this bolding and italicisation, is probably a good, option. So they will bold whatever is a named entity and they would, italicise, what is not, and they would, for example, get the page or the document as HTML, where the things to annotate would be, highlighted in yellow. So that would be yellow background and they would, browse all the yellow backgrounds and they would italicise those that are not, and bold those that are. So this is quick, to do, and, then someone would, again have to, take these, saved files back, and re-insert the annotation into, nice, XML. So that we do not we don't want to have we need to formalize it in our way of course and not in bold facing and, italicisation. So, It is possibly doable over the few weekends, like conversion of, the plain text files, search for the, type level annotation, items, marking those, the. Like those. It would be good if people already are looking at the documents, if they, actually saw, the type level annotation, because there could be errors, and they could notice there are errors in that type level annotation. They would not be supposed to modify it, but just, by accident, they could they could debug it. So, maybe, maybe we so without any person at hand, at the moment, except you, PERSON7, I suggest that, you actually try, taking the list from PERSON1. PERSON1, is the list finished or is anything missing? Finished? Right, perfect, yeah. And, and, you would, then, apply this list, to all the documents, that includes the transcripts as well as the, the minutes, actually, and, you would use color-coding. So, you would, highlight with a light yellow, all the, items, it like when they were f where they were found, and with shiny yellow, items that, are, unclear at the type level. And, people would scroll and you would save this as HTML. And people would open that HTML in, ORGANIZATION4 Word, they would see the, the sl like s light yellow, items, and they would, they could, somehow mark them red or whatever if there is some problem, or they could send us some, maybe it should have also sentence numbers. That's probably a good idea, to introduce like sentence IDs, and they would ignore those, so maybe they could be in smaller, much smaller font, so that they would not be distracting when reading the text, but it would be, there for synchronization. And it's also good, when ORGANIZATION4 Word, will screw up the file after saving it. Then you can re-synchronize at these, IDs. So this I've done that in the past, so it's it's it's helpful to have some formal, trait in the in the document. So the annotators would open that, they could report, unexpected problems with the, with the light yellow, areas, and they would always like select by double clicking the words and, and bold face, for yes, and italicise for no, the individual, s named entity occurrences. And that would be, the, token level annotation. And they would save the file, and you would convert this file, into the XML. So the final XML would be, again, like plain text, with the text, and the text would say, something which is written in the in the notes, so. Do you have that, a document. Are you are you looking at the text from, minuting?",
            "I guess I sent -",
            "Yes, so did I, so, So PERSON7 surely has the link the automatic, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Which minutes are you, talking about?",
            "It's, this one, let me paste the link -",
            "The de-identification procedure.",
            "I'm sharing the, the link again.",
            "Oh, okay. M-hm. Okay, but, one thing is that, if I prepare, those HTML files, the annotators cannot edit them without, opening them, in an editor. Is it possible for the annotator, or?",
            "They should open the HTML in Word, in ORGANIZATION4 Word, or whatever, an open off, in LibreOffice.",
            "Okay, it does support that?",
            "Yes it's it's try it yourself. Like, create an HTML, make a span, which is like a light yellow, or span which is shining yellow, open it in, in, in LibreOffice, or ORGANIZATION4 Word, and do the bolding, do the italicisation, and, save it. And your goal, or the programmer skull if you cannot do it yourself, would be to extract the, s the indicators, this is essentially indicators, and put them into the, the clean XML format. There will be a lot of, like, mess around, because whenever you open HTML in these editors, they will add a lot of, useless stuff, but it should be, fairly easy, to extract that information, back.",
            "Yeah, I will look for that, but, I must tell you again that, I jus I'm just limited to weekends.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So if, if you could find someone else, that would be great, but in case no one is available, I will do that, maybe slower, but, I can.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, so let's. While you're here, let's discuss, the markup, and then I'll try to find another person as well, if I find, then, like you wouldn't have to do it if, if I won't, then, but it's still up to you, or, PERSON9 at the la as the last resort, but he is pretty busy with the, preparation of the workshop itself, so, that's also like, that would be increasing the risk. So, I've copied from the, this is strange, like I made a copy, and then now the. PERSON1 please, can you put this remark of mine, about the timeline, somewhere, outside of that comment, so that we do not lose it? Because I feel that if I, like modify this text, the comment has now moved, with the copy pasting, and that's bad.",
            "M-hm. Yes.",
            "So please, put it into the main text of that, of the minutes.",
            "M-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So, the XML markup should be absolutely clear, about the, stages of the processing, and the annotation itself can be like undecided, that is okay. But the, the, the stage of the processes have to be clear. So, examples of, annotation, or, or let's yeah, yeah. Yeah. NE annotation, using our custom XML markup. So. This is a sentence with, PERSON8's, name. And that would be, So NE, then the questions whether we want to have the type as well, that would be, yeah. And sh, and let's call it, NE suspects. So like, like, I'm I'm open for your suggestions. Or maybe, PERSON7, you should, come up with that markup yourself, so that it is, so that it reads, reads well. So this the one option is that we will have left this NE suspect. Another option would be that we would have NE, status equals, suspected. And then the next stage would be NE status, equal, confirmed, at type level, NE status, S this what would be the negative, to disproved, or, disproved at, token level. And then here could be actually suspected by, s to, by RegEx, capital, letter, or something like that, right? Confirmed, at token level, annotator, someone's name, anno, actually for the type level, it's, always PERSON1 now, or the other person, so like, PERSON1, and the other person, wha yeah. Yeah, the other person. And then anno-tator, would be someone, specific, confirmed, at token level. And there could always be type equals something. So does this type of annotation, make sense to you, to all of you, actually?",
            "Yes, but, my question is are we going to show them only the sentences with the with those words, or the whole text, and some words in it?",
            "So I think this is, mainly question to PERSON1. My guess is that, we have to show the full text, and ideally we should, allow them to skip quickly through the instances of that. So, maybe, like, suggested presentation to the, annotators, HTML, loaded or imported, to ORGANIZATION4 Word. And that would be, this is a, sentence with, PERSON8's name. And then this would, there would be NE question mark, in, small letters, so that they could search for NE, right? And then this would be, the shining yellow and what they would do, and maybe this we could make this red so that they could also, so that they would like have a visual, a clear, visual way. And they could search for NE question mark, so they would just type control F, control F, that would jump there, and they would double click. And then, like here the double key doesn't really work. So they would then bold face, and, save. And I think that, we have to present the full documents. PERSON1, do you think that, us individual sentences would be sufficient?",
            "You're muted, PERSON1.",
            "Sorry. I think that uf, individual sentences does not are not sufficient, because sometimes they are very short. Sometimes you have just this short SAO, or as a sentence, and we don't want to, er, filter all of that as it if it is so if it's not so complicated, I would vote for showing more.",
            "Yeah. So it's actually, I think it's even it makes things easier, because we can stick. To the documents.",
            "M-hm.",
            "We would only convert them from the current format, which is plain text, into this HTML with the, with the, like, highlighted places. And people would, then, download these files, or s PERSON1, how do you communicate with them, what would be the recommended way? So if the, is it best for you that you really would individually send them the files, and tell them, open this in ORGANIZATION4 Word, and do the bold facing and italicisation, of all the.",
            "It so what kind of program, will, they work in, in, just, text program?",
            "Whatever editor.",
            "Whatever editor?",
            "Just text editor.",
            "It's easier just to send the files, so PERSON9 has invented well invented, has begun a very nice way using ORGANIZATION1 Forms for that, so that they, s.",
            "Actually upload the files, right?",
            "Upload the files so they have the whole table of.",
            "Yeah, another option is to go for ORGANIZATION1 Docs, if that would,",
            "But then we have to do, open, make open kind of, open access to ORGANIZATION1 Docs, to our transcripts, from ethical point of view.",
            "Yes, that's right, yeah so that would we would have to like, ORGANIZATION1 Docs obviously they have the permissions system, so we could somehow like divide it and, and like make it accessible only to specific people, and so on. But, it's I'll leave up to you what is what is easier for you, if you are used, and if people are used for this uploading of documents, then perhaps that is, that is the easiest option.",
            "I think, by that way, we can also, keep track, we when they are submitting, and it gets, like submitted to a specific folder, so it's easier, for us to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "Monitor, actually, yeah.",
            "I'll do one more thing I'll do to the yellow, the light yellow highlight here, and maybe this is too light, so we'll have to come up with some, so that they would actually yeah this is probably the right, thing. So this is also, like this is the suspected entity, and, now the question is how do we, say that we do not think that our type based annotation, does not indicate that this is a named entity, so,",
            "So this light yellow is for words that are, maybe form in the.",
            "No, no, no, no. So they I think that the bright yellow is for the maybe ones, that you have to decide. And this light yellow is for those there where, we do have the decision. So maybe, maybe, let's do it like green, the this is not a name, with the PERSON8's name and, PERSON3's name. And let's say that for some reason, at the type level, we have already dif like decided, that PERSON3 is a person, whereas this was decided as not a person.",
            "I get it.",
            "Why should we mark non-per non-named entities?",
            "Because there has been an automated or, halfway automated decision made, and, it is good for the people to validate that decision. And it would.",
            "Aha, so they validate all decisions about all known phrases.",
            "I think that they, so they definitely have to, make the decision for the undecided ones, for the maybe ones, that's the, bright yellow, and, I think that they should just occasionally look at the green and red ones. And if the, if there is a name which is, which is not red, or if there is a non-name, which is.",
            "Yeah, but, so, you, you ca just imagine how colorful it's going to be, just.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yes,",
            "This is green sentence is also going to be green, one name is green and another name is green, so it will be extremely colorful, and really, a lo a lot of work, really lot of work.",
            "And those words that we are saying that they are not names are, very, common in the whole text, so it would be a very green text.",
            "Okay, yeah, let's it's it's important for, that you are saying this. So let's make it simpler. I totally agree. I very often come up with some overkill, so, yeah. So then, we would be this would be, not highlighted at all.",
            "They would be doing the bold facing, and italicisation, and, they would be checking, and now, should it be red or should it be, green? They should be validating that this is a name. So, should it be green, would that be better?",
            "Doesn't.",
            "Doesn't matter, right?",
            "I think green is good.",
            "Yeah. So, like normally, they wouldn't be touching these green things, they would only be sometimes touching it and saying, well, this is actually not a name, and they would italicise it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so I think that like I'll I'll I need to prepare for another, call. And I also want to, want to talk to, to the send, the email to the two other, prospective sources of programmers. But, I would like you to, continue with this, with this markup. And also with the debate how that should be prepared for the annotators. And, please do a test document, so that, well, PERSON7 will prepare it and PERSON1 will do the bolding, and, and PERSON7 will try to get the information back, right? So that we are sure that, for the given editor, we are able to extract that information with, not too many problems.",
            "Ah okay.",
            "So there are two things, to do, so. To dos, one to do is to, double check, the stages, and whether they are clearly, reflected, in XML markup options, and then, test the HTML, Word, HTML, and then extraction. We'll do this, test, test on one document. Right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so I think that's that's probably everything f that you needed from me for this, pipeline right, for the, for the procedure for de-identification. Is that correct?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay, great. And, PERSON9, I agree with you that we, have to go for the Scientific Committee, so, we'll do a challenge, with the Scientific Committee, so we now need the web page to be completed, so that we can put that into that email and ask the people, right?",
            "PERSON4, did you.",
            "Yes, so I will.",
            "Sorry, okay, continue.",
            "Yeah, so I will I will make the website ready within maybe one or two hours, and, let you know that it's ready, you can go ahead, so whatever suggestion. And I also ported the website in the PROJECT1, GitHub. So, it's there now.",
            "Yes, it is there? Okay, that's good.",
            "Any changes if you'd want to make, it's there.",
            "And the way, to roll.",
            "I will send you the link, yeah.",
            "Yeah. And the way to roll it out to the web, if you, if I made any changes on the GitHub, will they automatically appear on in the web or, will you, you have to push a button?",
            "No, no, no, no.",
            "So they are fully automatic?",
            "You can you can directly commit, you can directly commit and it will directly, reflect the way.",
            "Okay, okay that's ideal, yeah. So I'll thank you, I'll and we should, be able to finalise this during the afternoon. I have another call in 20 minutes. But after that, call I can look at that, so that's that seems like, I think.",
            "And another thing PERSON4, like, while we are still waiting for the Scientific Committee to get developed, we I think, like we are running short on time, for PROJECT2.",
            "Let's submit it. Let's subm.",
            "Let's submit it, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.",
            "Yes. So I'll I'll review that in that, document, that you have you have already notifi like marked, that part for me.",
            "Yeah, yeah, right, exactly.",
            "Okay, thank you. And, PERSON1, you wanted something, right?",
            "Just about these Russians, you didn't write them yet, yes?",
            "No n I haven't written to anybody.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, that's, should happen once the webpage is ready, and that should be.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. Just, I was unsure about the table, getting it updated. Okay, thank you.",
            "And I wa actually, PERSON5 is not on this call. I don't know why. Is she normally, would be probably coming, right? So she also said that she would be adding some more names to the to this sheet, to the prospective, Scientific Committee. Maybe just ping her, but it's yeah, we whatever, it's, we have just, separated the calls for participation with the submission, so we are not in, that big hurry. Okay, so I tha think.",
            "I can also I can also put the names, so, because I have also, done a bit of review surveying for those papers, so, I can do that.",
            "Okay, yeah, okay.",
            "PERSON4, I sent you a, I mean, I needed a, a reference letter, before two weeks ago, I sent you a link, I mean they sent you a link. If you had time, please, fill that, it's for scholarship.",
            "Yes, I haven't seen that link. I've seen your request, the regular email, but the link is buried somewhere in my inbox, so I'll try to locate it and may like, please help me locating it. Is it Toronto? What is the keyword, Toronto, or?",
            "Calgary.",
            "Calgary, okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I'll I'll I'll try, if I don't if you don't hear from me a confirmation, then please, ask again, because it's.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay. Thank you. So I'm leaving. And now, I, yeah?",
            "And.",
            "Yeah?",
            "And finally yeah, PERSON4, so yeah, so co like during this week, could you fix up a meeting with PERSON6? Maybe, if you have time, like, for maybe briefly.",
            "To talk about.",
            "Yeah, I haven't seen her today. Yeah, we'll find some time, so yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay, sure. So I need to, make someone host now, and, whoever, I'll make PERSON9 the host, of this meeting? Yes. So I'm, leaving, and, yeah, yeah, thank you.",
            "Yeah, bye-bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Okay, thank you, bye-bye.",
            "Okay, guys, may I ask you something?",
            "Yes.",
            "Are we in the, process of submitting a paper, or, I'm just.",
            "We are in the process of submitting the, PROJECT3 proposal. So, we would want to host the PROJECT3 in some conference, which is probably, PROJECT2 or ORGANIZATION2, so we are submitting to, two places currently, that proposed file, PROJECT3.",
            "Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, that's good.",
            "So, yeah, so PERSON7, so, it would be really great that if we can also, quickly prepare a demo of the, like just one document and see how it looks like, for the an for the annotators. And, then maybe afters after, like, looking at the, like, you know, like the annotated file, if you are busy sometimes, I can also step in, and like, do the problematic parts. Whenever I will, fe like get some time out of this studios, yeah.",
            "Okay, I'll try to do that. But, if I, is there any deadline, I mean, any hard deadline that is near?",
            "The thing is that we need to have all the data processed by February mid. So, yeah.",
            "It also depends on the annotators. I mean, how much time it will take, after I prepared the XML files, how much it will take for annotators? Do you know that, PERSON1?",
            "So.",
            "It also depends. I will of how good, the annotation tool will look like. So if it's just click, so it's actually, may have been differently. So some people are working quicker, some people are slower, somebody is kind of, more accurate and it takes longer, and someone just goes through, and it's not accurate, but it's extremely quick. So very quick person, who is getting giving me back the meeting in two hours after I give him, it's shorter than the meeting than the meeting duration. I don't know how he, is able to write minutes quicker than the meeting duration. But. Well. If we want to make 100 hours, let's count, 200, I don't know.",
            "Okay. So, I'll try my best to prepare it as soon as possible.",
            "You are, well, I can't find a word to express my appreciation.",
            "No problem. No problem, guys.",
            "Okay, so, so, PERSON7, like, where do you think for the, like, maybe the first, sample should be ready, like when we should look for that? What is the whatever would be, flexible for you?",
            "I guess end of this week is good.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "If I have to be concrete. Yeah, is that good?",
            "Yeah, that should be good. And, let us catch up, maybe, when do you, think we should catch up next, maybe, in the coming week, Monday? Would that be okay with you?",
            "Yes, I think that's good.",
            "Okay, great, great. Because I really, want to see the sample, so that I can also like help you, in some, in some respect, so that it, we can do it very quickly. Because, li nowadays we are on a very, strict timeline. So, there are there are multiple presses. We have to send that proposal. And PERSON4 is really, wa like he wants to have the sample data, at least, some files, to be uploaded on the on the website as soon as possible.",
            "Yeah, actually, if we have the codes, that won't be the matter of, one file or two files. If you have the code, we can just run down all of this.",
            "Yeah, all of them, right, right, right.",
            "So, I hope it will be ready, for next week.",
            "Okay, okay, great.",
            "Yeah. So, are we done?",
            "Yeah, I think, we are, almost done. And, yeah, I, I may want to talk a bit, a few more minutes with PERSON1, regarding the, proposal. So you are welcome to stay, or if you have other work, you can like.",
            "No, I prefer to. I'll leave you alone, guys.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "But it was nice to meet you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "It was nice to see you, PERSON7, as usual as always.",
            "Thank you, you too.",
            "Bye-bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye-bye.",
            "Okay, so, like, yesterday, there were ano there were almost another ten emails from PERSON4, regarding the, proposal and the and the website. So, but, I have vitigated, all those things, now he has to review. And once he reviews, I think we are good to send a PROJECT2 proposal.",
            "Perfect.",
            "Okay. So do you have access to that? Maybe PERSON1, you can also take a look.",
            "To what?",
            "To the to the proposal.",
            "So you se -",
            "It's.",
            "-definitely.",
            "It's a ORGANIZATION1 Doc, let me, send you,",
            "So it's in the master document, PERSON1, if you can if you can see.",
            "Master? Master document? What is master document?",
            "I should rename it as Master document, the PROJECT3 components. Just.",
            "Try to find a conversation with you. It's snowing, outside. It's snowing so beautifully, wow.",
            "Yeah, did you say something?",
            "Yes, that it's really beautifully snowing, outside.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Beautiful snow. Sorry, it's just better comment.",
            "Wish yeah, wish I was there.",
            "Yeah. Wish I was there I hope you are coming.",
            "Yeah, PERSON1, but, I'm still not, very, confident towards flying now, because you know that, there is a new variant and, it has the potential to disload all the.",
            "But it's.",
            "All the forms.",
            "But it's weaker. Isn't it weaker?",
            "No.",
            "No?",
            "No, no, no.",
            "They say that it's not so strong, kind of.",
            "No.",
            "No?",
            "No, it's it's not the case, it's not the case. You can look at the numbers in the UK, so, and, not only the numbers, you can see the death rate. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's alarming.",
            "Really?",
            "It's not really weaker. Yeah, because you know. Like, as always, any person who is having a comorbidity, is susceptible, towards that.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yes, yes, same here.",
            "Really, and I'm really sad about that, but I had to stay here.",
            "Yeah, same here, same here. So, this is this is that I know like PERSON4 is saying, like, you should come, maybe for a month, do all the paperworks, but. I think if there's option, I will just go there and stay, but why? Why to why to just go there for a month?",
            "But maybe, so if we if y if you wait for half a year, it will turn out turn out really better. Don't you hope, for that?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I definitely hope. Once the vaccine, mass immunation program starts, it will obviously slow the spread. And once the once the spread, goes a townward trajectory, then it is, like, it is going to end.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, I'm just waiting for that time.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, to be absolutely -",
            "Yeah, actually it's very rational.",
            "Yeah. So once, once there is a downward train to that, okay, the vaccines, are working and definitely, like no vaccine is 100 percent correct, right? So there is a margin of error, for all of them, but it has the ability, to stop the spread. That's what That's what we're looking for. It's not foolproof that no one will die after the vaccines will be there, but definitely the rate would be much, much lesser.",
            "Yes, yes, definitely. But let's hope.",
            "So, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I think it's positive, because, you know, like the various, the various pharmaceutical companies that have come up with the vaccines, so, they have, done some rigorous trials, and, like ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION3 they are more than 90 percent, accurate, so.",
            "Really? Well, they say 80, in Russia.",
            "No, no. In the in the phase two it is like 90 percent.",
            "It's quite a good.",
            "It's a quite a good. Even if the vaccine works for 70 percent, accuracy, it has still the ability to stop the spread, yeah.",
            "Well.",
            "But obviously, we have to be careful, like we can't, like -",
            "We have to submit a PROJECT3 proposal, we have to be careful, right?",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "Yeah, we have we have no choice.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Okay. Okay, PERSON1, so,",
            "Let me open I'm just trying to find, the documents you sent me yesterday. Call for participation, and now I see some ORGANIZATION1 Doc, PROJECT3, first PROJECT3 on automatic minuting and then a lot of task. No, this is not the one.",
            "So I think, it starts with PROJECT2 and, twenty-twenty-one.",
            "Will you send me the link again. Aha, PROJECT2!",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yes, I alrea I'm already there. It's okay.",
            "Okay, okay, great. Yeah, so this is the call for participation. So which, like, I would, ask you to see, like. And also, most importantly, after that, you can see that submission portal requirements. So this is the one, which.",
            "Aha, aha, portal requirements, aha.",
            "Yeah, so this is the one, that we have to submit, very quickly, like maybe, if it is, done by today, we submit it today.",
            "But we don't have this.",
            "It's not really big.",
            "-committee. We don't have Scientific Committee. And outline of the program we don't have it either. Invited speakers, ugh. Okay, okay, I will read it. With registration isn't it possible to make the link shorter?",
            "Which one?",
            "Registration. On the second page. It's extremely long.",
            "Oh, okay, so this is actually for the website, in the website, you won't, find this link. It is just, for us to review.",
            "Yes, yes, okay.",
            "In the website, it's. So, people will won't see the won't see the link.",
            "Okay. Just, not the review committee see this link.",
            "No, don't worry. So, you can, so the I should paste the new website link, and I think it's there.",
            "U-huh, yeah.",
            "I.",
            "Yes, I, I can see it. Website.",
            "Oh okay.",
            "At the end of the, third page.",
            "Yes.",
            "And this, I am totally sick of them, what is that.",
            "Oh, which?",
            "So, what we do. Submission try. Yes, so the, I see that these are requirements, but. Yeah, but we already have it, actually.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Yes, I see that. Aha.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Wait. Yeah, I see, I see.",
            "So, PERSON1, you can also put your web page, and, I'll i will just check it out and put your, website. So far.",
            "You want do you want me to send it? I have it already, almost.",
            "Y-yes, the you can, also put there, or maybe you can just send me, I will put it there.",
            "It's even has quite a short. Chat. It's here, I have sent it. But make sure you have a open it, because you have taken the picture from there.",
            "Okay. Okay, I will I will I shall put it there, yeah.",
            "Aha, so I actually could put it there myself, sorry, sorry for that.",
            "Yeah, it's okay.",
            "I just, somehow didn't didn't so I just thought, I should found somewhere the XML, source. Where is it? I would rather send it to PERSON9. And there is actually not no XML source, so sorry for that.",
            "Okay. And, another thing is, like, I will now, like PERSON4 has some suggestion on the website, so, I will make it quickly and send it to him, so that he can send it to the Scientific Commu Committee, very quickly. And, and I think restings are okay, so. I really want to get all this, proposal submission stuffs done by, January tenth, maybe, so that we can like, again, focus back to our, research part.",
            "Finally, for once.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
            "Yes, I a looking forward for that, I'm really bad at this, organisational things.",
            "Yeah, don't worry.",
            "Don't worry, we'll take care of it, yeah.",
            "Yes, you are very good, really, at. I miss I miss this actually normal English words. Admir I admire that, I know.",
            "Actually, like I too, like one or one and half year back, I was also, not, I was also new to all new to this. But I learned from my colleagues, like organising, three or four workshops, and, it really helped. So, now, I'm a bit fluent of what to do, and what not to.",
            "Yeah, I know, but I'm bad at organising whatever, I really never, in my life, organised anything. I'm really, really personal, I'm good at personal things and then, very bad at organisational and kind of group things. It's kind of differences between people and I really, I'm really very bad at all these group, things.",
            "Okay, so, did you har did you hear back from PERSON5?",
            "No.",
            "Recently? I'm not sure.",
            "But I didn't write her I didn't write here. So, I will I have to write her.",
            "Okay.",
            "I have just so you didn't either, yes?",
            "No, I thought, she might be joining, because she knows, she's getting the our emails maybe, I'm not sure.",
            "Maybe she is also, somewhere on Christmas holid so we are kind of, still having Christmas holidays. That's why I'm, well, kind of, relaxed about, all things. Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, only the only thing is that it's absolutely okay, yeah, but, the sit.",
            "We have to submit, yes.",
            "The situation is not good.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but it's absolutely, but I'm just worried that if the situation is not good and, hope everything is okay with her, so, yeah.",
            "Yes, yes, I will write you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, okay then, PERSON1, so maybe we can, catch up tomorrow? And, by then, by then, let me finish the pending task.",
            "Yes, yes, and, PERSON9, I'm having another call at half past one, tomorrow. So we'll have just half an hour, but it's, okay.",
            "It's it's absolutely okay. We can even skip tomorrow, and, keep on working, and maybe we can meet.",
            "We'll see. So if we need to discuss something, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.",
            "And also, I will also ask PERSON5 how, and, we can soon.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Okay.",
            "But, let's contact anytime if you need something.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure, definitely, yeah.",
            "Okay, see you.",
            "Okay, take care, take care.",
            "See you, bye-bye.",
            "Bye-bye.",

            "Yeah, okay, okay, okay.",
            "You have nice machines there.",
            "Yeah, I got it built on during the. And it came one and half or two months ago actually. Yeah.",
            "Okay, it seems that I like I need to disconnect first, and then reconnect so, okay. I'll be here in few seconds.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Hi good to see you.",
            "Hi, hi, hi PERSON12, how are you?",
            "So welcome.",
            "But it was. So now I'm actually back to work and that actually improved my mood.",
            "Yeah, okay. And my holidays were also not kind of like that fun. As the New Year is king of expected of but filled more with assignments, projects, these. Kinds of stuff you know. But that was still fun stuff so you cannot complain.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So are you actually staying in Mannheim in the dorms or in.",
            "No, this is this is my private apartment.",
            "And is it in Barbican city or is it the other side. There was, like.",
            "You mean.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes so this is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "It is more like a kind of village kind of part of the city. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I see that PERSON5 is here and as well. So PERSON7 any news about your electricity or is it?",
            "Yes, it's back.",
            "It's back yeah. Yeah, it is, yeah. There is some, some noise cancellation. And so hopefully that will work out. Okay, so let's get started, because we want to, cut this shortest, so yeah. So we fit into the half hour and PERSON3 is hopefully answering. So, my to dos. Or the items, that I want, to, bring up, are the two sessions that we have. So one is PROJECT13 and the other is PROJECT6. So PROJECT13 is the Holocaust survivor's session. And the PROJECT6 has been postponed by a month. So that gives us, some extra time, which is, which is good. I've started documents with \"to do\" lists. This is mainly on PERSON7. But I would like to ask anyone who could help. So PERSON13 you or you said that, you would be very busy and you could. Like, is there anything you can help with or, or.",
            "I, I would not make any like false promise like, make, a, promise now, and otherwise. Not do it. So I am, I'm like I will be quite honest because I'm like slumbered with the homework, the. Assignments and exams approaching. I'm on the technical calls regularly so I'm like up to date with what is like happening and who is. Doing what. So after a month when I get time I think I can get quickly to the project.",
            "Yeah, okay. So in case you had some extra time I suggest that you talk directly to PERSON7.",
            "Okay, I'm happy to do that.",
            "And ask if there is any like one shot of thing that you could do. It, it, could, be, any, data preparation, like, downloading for, some, some, domain data. You know, for the two, events, or, or, something, like that. Yeah. I'm happy to see PERSON14 here as well. So PERSON14 have you answered whether you would be available as a back-up? Or, I haven't asked you yet? Sorry, my fault. I'm I'm sending a question to PERSON14 now, so the second event, the PROJECT6 will have two. Parts. One will be online, pre-recorded. And that will be interleaved with a real live discussion, which will take place, in the PROJECT6. And, I'm, going to the PROJECT6 tomorrow. For like technical meeting. So I will see where can we plug our bear ringers and actually record the sound, on the, On site. And I 'just checking if PERSON14 would be available as a back-up person in case of whatever I get. Sick, or something like that. For that is in February. It has been moved to the 26th of February. So we need. Yeah.",
            "Yes, okay. I can do it.",
            "Yes, thanks. So, so I plan to do it myself. I plan to go there, but like, we need a back-up person. And, also for the PROJECT13 event. We need someone to take care of the recording, so the archiver person. So then we do not lose that session again. So this is, these two things. And, like, the more important and still persisting topic to work on is the ladder climbing and. I've suggested here, in the, in the, paragraph for PERSON7, That we could use simple HTML tables that would be auto generated, and that would grow. And, yeah, it could show that. So I think that would be probably the easiest, to just put up the tables as HTML. But it could get difficult when we want to see the differences as the perform. As like the like new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign. It may be difficult to prepare these tables. So I asked PERSON3 and PERSON3 unfortunately won't be available during this call. To tell us whether the Weights and Biases, which is a web based solution. Some start up company which offers, accounts for academic purposes for free, if that would help. Us are or not. Yeah, okay, so Weights and Biases this is not really, recommended by PERSON3. And so the simple HTML is probably the, the way to go. So as soon as PERSON7 has these evaluations, cleaned up. So that means moving the few scripts to, where they belong from PROJECT2 test set and some. Automatic runner. Then also, please create a conversion from the tables into HTML. Similarly to the tech conversion and then put these results, regularly to your webpage. Or what you could even do, is to have a full, Git check out, directly located in this. Public HTML or simling from that public HTML. So that, it would be immediately accessible through the web. And anybody could have a look at the current scoring, and like explore that. So this, this would be useful, especially for people outside of ORGANIZATION4 such as, ORGANIZATION10, we. Know they have like. The performance was bad for some of the files and they could directly, browse it on the. Web. They could also browse it actually in on ORGANIZATION7. So if this is up to you to set it up so that it is like user friendly and easy and easy to. Follow.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah, I'll do that.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So that is, myself. I'm now, working on, getting to update the, demo paper submission, which is due next. Friday, if I 'not mistaken. And then I have some project reports to do, and I'm starting to gather documents, like, or. Links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions. So there is the standard work. And then I'm pretty busy with minuting. Like not doing anything myself, but just arranging what people do. So this is my report. So please, then proceed one by one and tell me. We have already heard from PERSON13 probably no progress over the Christmas. Yeah, that's that's fine like it is it is exam period. So, so PERSON7. Maybe if you could summarize your impressions from the finishing of the deliverables. Like, What is missing, and what is, what, you, were, happy, about, and, what you were unhappy. About, when doing D one point five and D six point three.",
            "I think of the one point five. Okay, so we are just reporting. I mean, we are reporting the numbers of words, so, the statistics about the transcript percent, Right? Oh yeah, it is a good metric, I would say to represent the numbers. But I would also say that, we should also represent a language pairs. Like. let's say,",
            "Yeah.",
            "English to a German or English to Czech or vies versa, so that, ultimately we get, Enough. Originally we wanted to get an idea about, the conversion, like the world ratio of two. Languages for a given transcript.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That would also be helpful. And then this would probably also, help us in getting. So I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, PROJECT3 and we. Want to remove it. Or we had to remove the empty lines, due to profanity filtering. So we had to check it at the moment that, whether to remove the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So far. I'm not really sure.",
            "So what do you.",
            "I can't remember the word exactly.",
            "Yeah, so let me let me take a record here, so, PERSON7 will do this. And then, as observations, of some D one point five empty, six point, three. Preparation. So, for, test set size. Info we should at a statistic per, language pair. Then, for what was for was the second thing. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, so, for.",
            "For PROJECT3 as well. We should add, to complimentary metric, actually it is more. We should add complementary met these complementary metric. So, you mentioned one, and that is profanity filtering, evaluation. So, have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And then, then, rare words evaluation. And here have an explicit list of names and, terms, that we, do want to appear in. The output. Scored, not simply by word error rate but, scored by something which directly accounts, These things, right? Yes, so I totally agree. This involves also manual preparation of the reference, so, both need manual, Manually created references. I have one remark from PERSON9. So, PERSON2 has compiled, some, translation dictionary, and, Should. She should share it soon. So this could become an PROJECT9 part of the second thing of the railroad. So this would be the rare, words, eval for PROJECT9 and then from PROJECT13 we are also likely. To get some dictionary. So that will be PROJECT13 domain obviously? And PERSON7 could I ask you to revise the PROJECT1 domain and creates such a dictionary by looking at. The outputs and what is missing in the outputs. So like short listing, listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the PROJECT1 domain. Could you do that?",
            "I think I still have to make a call with, PERSON10. So we haven't had a call yet. So probably I will have one call with him next Monday.",
            "And then, you know, I can also look at it.",
            "Yeah, so you are. You are afraid you are busy. You, probably, can 't get to it soon.",
            "Actually. No, I mean. Not before Monday. Because tomorrow I have my test.",
            "So, let's, well. Next week, consider if PERSON7 would have the capacity to extract. Or we could also ask PERSON1, not PERSON10, but, PERSON1, to extract. This positive plus negative lists from PROJECT1 or domain documents. So that would be the various PROJECT8, things.",
            "There was one more thing.",
            "So basically, it has to do with the scores that we are calculating.",
            "So, I think we need to improve our segmenter, the worlds are getting revised fine. If, we improve our segmenters our score should be higher than what we are getting.",
            "Okay, so, the, segmenter or well, it is a problem. Yeah. If we improve that, yeah, well, it would be much better. Okay, so, what I miss still, and what should belong to the ladder climbing and the regular. Reports is PROJECT10 style of evaluation. So we will, talk about this at the latest next Wednesday with partners. Whether we are happy with the way of delay is being calculated. So, PERSON7 could you get us, also some of the delay scores? So maybe, start with a single document. Do not do it for all of them yet. But, get in touch with PERSON1 and get some delay scores for some of the files from the PROJECT2. Test set. Probably from the IWPROJECT10 Dev set, the, the, the Portuguese or whatever, domain. So, segmenter is related tom this a lot, so that's why it occurred to me that we. Need that. So, PERSON7 please prepare for, for the, Wednesday call with, like, other. Partners by, getting PROJECT10 scores delay plus PROJECT7, on one of the IWPROJECT10 Dev, files or. Other, PROJECT1 domain files. So again, with the help of PERSON1, ask him right now how to get it. The plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it. Just for one file. And see, what we get there?",
            "Okay, sure. I'll first ask him to, correct po the current PROJECT10L for the correct type we have. So the correct one is not working. I had to come almost come from the back from it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. So yeah, I should mention that loud, that like, PERSON7, has done tremendous amount of work, For the deliverable. It was towards the end of the year. Luckily, he doesn't celebrate Christmas. So it was not a spoiled Christmas break for any, any European person. It would be as spoiled Christmas. So, they. in the end, I'm I'm happy with the tables that we put into the deliverables. But this is something which I have been asking for since August already. So you see, that like, it's is despite, it seems simple, it actually takes time, and we need to. Work this way. And I, for the continuous, evaluation, for the ladder climbing I really do want to have tha, These observations being gathered like throughout the weeks and. Not for the deadline. Because, then you see how stressful it was to get, all the things together. So, so let's, that is for everybody. Let us keep in mind that evaluation is something which takes time. And, like the presentation of that is also important, and we need to do it way before the. Deadline is approaching. So hopefully we will be more likely with, like, time allocation for this, and hopefully it. Will be less, stressful. For both of the sessions, PROJECT13 and PROJECT6 I do already want to choose the system the. Pipeline from some choices, and this has to be based on some numbers. So we haven't done that before. We have always used just some of the system and not really thought about which one, but let's. Really start making an informed choice.",
            "Oh yes. So, PROJECT13 is going to be in Czech, right? Yes, if I'm not mistaken. It is in Czech, right? So that actually. Yeah.",
            "You will need to be in touch with PERSON10, as you said, because we need to revive, the. PROJECT5. And PERSON5 is trying to get PROJECT5 running for himself as well. But I 'not sure how far he is so like, I believe.",
            "Well, I finally, I finally managed to compile it.",
            "Well it was some fix I found on the internet. It was just some flag for linking. So it wasn't that bad, actually. And now I 'trying to, train the a model on common voice. And I was thinking that maybe I should revise which the data set. I will be actually using for the for the experiment.",
            "Because of most papers, actually, they are not using a common voice. So maybe it is better to use some other data set. But on the other hand, benefit of the common voice is that we have additional information about. Gender and speakers. And there are also non native speakers there, many, non native speakers, mostly Indians and so on. So the question is, which data set we want to use, or whether we want to use more datasets.",
            "More datasets. My answers is definitely more datasets. So I suggest that you choose what. Well, there is an email that I send already before Christmas. To PERSON17 and PERSON15 so to the ORGANIZATION10 people asking about links to the data, and they still didn't. Respond. I sent them a reminder yesterday. If you have seen that as well, so hopefully they will respond. And I suggest that you use all they suggest, all they recommend. And, also common voice. Because we really need to. So the goal is to have the baseline, and then to do the, the word, cutting thing. But I think that already this baseline should be geared towards non native speakers. So that's why I'd definitely like the common voice to be in there. But at the same time, I'm, I'm pretty sure the common voice alone would be too small. It would not be good, it would be good for comparison purposes, but it would not be good as a. System for deployment.",
            "Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. As for the system day, it is clear that when it is all the data since we have available. But I was thinking rather about some paper from one that might stem from this experiment. And for that, it might be actually better to use some, more frequently used the dataset, for. Example, ORGANIZATION2, or maybe ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Yeah. So, whatever you can get easily and easily converted to the appropriate format. Please combine all that together. And, so when I said that PERSON8 is owing us the list of PROJECT4 data and other links, they actually. Have already provided these, links in some way. To deliverables in the work package one. So, these references are already available to some extent. And now I do not know which is if it is D one point. Let me check PROJECT2. You, deliverables, D one and D one five. So, D one and D one five. So, the one is, publicly available. D one five. I'm sure you have that in your overleaf PERSON5.",
            "Where can I find it, exactly?",
            "So I have.",
            "So I have overleaf open. So it's. So which document it is.",
            "So I 'now, I'm now in the search organization document. The one where we had the link. For this call.",
            "Okay, I will open it.",
            "D one five.",
            "D six three.",
            "No, D one five. So I 've just pasted the link, to the ORGANIZATION11 doc as well. So D one five is this one, yah, and D one is already published. So please browse these, there is an PROJECT3 section. And you are the one. You are actually the only one who is training PROJECT3 system, at ORGANIZATION4 these days. So you should, like clean or make yourself familiar with the data on our disks and put it. There. So net data, and not necessarily within PROJECT2. It can be also outside of PROJECT2 it can be like you have the directory. You know, the directory where to where to put these things.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the PROJECT2 data.",
            "Yah, okay.",
            "Sorry to interrupt. I was also thinking I would like to get in touch. I to work with PERSON5 on PROJECT5 PROJECT3 actually. I'm also thinking to do some non native speech.",
            "Like, in building a non native speech, automated system, for tor some languages, as a. Part of my, as a part of the masters thesis.",
            "So I mean, I think the sooner I get started working on it the sooner I will be able to I, I. Will be able to build the. I do not know, because I haven't done this in the past. So.",
            "Yeah. So is there still any benefit in talking to PERSON10 for the two of you PERSON13 and PERSON5? Because PERSON7 will have a call with PERSON10. So should you join that as well? So that you, like, PERSON10 has already written, like, understood some of the traces that PERSON11 left. For us. So he was able to run the system, at least. And now PERSON10 has left. So we need, we need to make sure it is stored. That the knowledge is stored with someone in the team, it can be PERSON7, but it also could be. PERSON13 and PERSON5.",
            "So, what I was thinking, that I should first view the video which PERSON11 had, Recorded, before he left. So, once, once, I, I, I, go through that, then I think, me a PERSON5 can decide on when to. Have a call, with PERSON10.",
            "Yeah. I'm two part of the of the video, or from the beginning. And, I. If I'm not mistaken that some of the paths are not existing yet. So, some things were removed, so I don't know whether we can run everything which is in the. Video. So maybe it will be better for us to attend the call with the PERSON10. So then we are with the most up-to-date version of our remote.",
            "Yeah, said the sounds. That, that actually sounds best.",
            "And then we can. And then we can have call together. So because I actually also like to work on the non native speakers so of it is actually, One part of my, of my thesis. So. But if I understand it correctly you would like to do this model using PROJECT5.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. Because that would be great because I 'more fan of the of the, you know, Models. So we can actually compare its performance. So that would be great to cooperate on this thing.",
            "Yeah, probably that would also, ease the distribution of PROJECT2 project.",
            "Okay, so, the call with, PERSON10, should continue right after this call.",
            "So, PERSON7, when is your call.",
            "No, I will probably talk to him on Monday. That is why I'll drop send him an email today. But PERSON10 is busy and not available on Friday, so it will be probably on Monday or. Tuesday.",
            "Okay, PERSON7. So, so please include me with the mail so I can add it to my calendar. Yeah sure, I'll I'll do and PERSON13. And probably PERSON13, PERSON13.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Great, okay. Great, so I'm happy that we have not missed this. This opportunity for sunchro, for a synch. Okay, thanks. So let's quickly move to PERSON14. Unless there is anything very important PERSON5 still needs to say. No, no, I think I don't have anything.",
            "Yeah, about the call with PERSON10. Actually I wanna ask, so, when do you finalise for the replacement for PERSON10. So me, the others and PERSON13 already know. Or if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that. Essentially he will also be training PROJECT3 systems if he is to replace PERSON10.",
            "Yes, you're talking about the what is his name. Sorry, I have missed that.",
            "PERSON4.",
            "Vi, PERSON4.",
            "There was. Yes.",
            "Vi, PERSON4, yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to, respond to that. That's my fault, it's on my \"to do\" list.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thanks. And PERSON14, you have the summary. So please present it.",
            "Yes.",
            "And you are just missing one more thing. And that is the language, oh yes, it's there, yes.",
            "It's there. So before Christmas, I released the PROJECT11 corpus for PERSON3. And this, this week, I implemented or trained speech language identification. I have a model for Czech, German and English which kind of works on YouTube videos in Euro. Parliament. And I tried on PERSON6 speaking her German accented English, and it worked. It in works in online mode, with three seconds delay, and I 'going to integrate it into the. Mediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it. And then I'm going to pass it to PERSON13 or anyone who can train other model the same way as me. Because maybe we need five languages of ORGANIZATION9 or anything else. And then I'm going to analyze the ASI dev data and then probably PROJECT12. Training or anything else.",
            "That, the PROJECT12 that will be with PERSON3. And one topic is missing. And that is the, study. Subtitler study where we are aiming for the end of the month deadline, right? Are we?",
            "Yes, probably.",
            "It should be doable. So let's. Let's give it a try, it. It would be like. It would be great if we managed to do that. So I will write it down. So, aiming, towards ORGANIZATION8 deadline with a subtitler study paper, yes, and then, Then PROJECT12. With PERSON3 or based upon PERSON3. And for the language ID I'm curious, how do you want to integrate it exactly. Because it already involves considering multiple PROJECT3 sources, multiple channels. So, what would be the use case for, for the language idea. How do we plug that in? Do we plug it as.",
            "It will, it will be as audio to text worker.",
            "And it will emit time stamps like.",
            "For a two second window. And class, you can see the silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the. Others how they want to use it, in, the, pipeline.",
            "That, is, that, is important. Please write this down here in the document, this briefing summary. Because, that is, PERSON7, and also PERSON7, when you talk to PERSON16 a well and also. Possibly PERSON13. If we have this tool, we need to ship the audio, to multiple, PROJECT3, or, Multiple, workers, in, the, directory. We will separately need to ship the audio to the English PROJECT3 separately. To the German PROJECT3 and the Czech PROJECT3 for example. Depending on the. And also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs. And this is the tool which we do not have yet. That's the PROJECT12 tool, which will be preserving these text outputs and also following the. Time stamps. And it would emit, it would probably like produce. Separate the output into the three language channels. Producing either silent or correct PROJECT3. So we need like, filters for the PROJECT3s so the PROJECT3 is silent if 'it's the wrong language and it, It, it is the recognized text if it is the correct language. So we need to figure out. So this is just one. Like I just made it up, this type of set-up. Another set up would be that, the same sound is shipped to PROJECT3 and this language checker and, That already, like this language checker is essentially a part of the PROJECT3 silencing the PROJECT3 if it. Is the wrong language. That is also an option. So, we need to figure out, which way, is of integrating the language ID. Is the best for our purposes. So, please keep thinking about, this, like what are our pipelines. Ideally, I think that, the, the, least, like, management, Confusion, and, and, so on would arise if our PROJECT9 models were multilingual. If it supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages. Into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input. So, we would have this multi langue multilingual, multiple PROJECT3 at the beginning all going into. English and then from the English would go into all of the languages. And later, when PERSON5 would have a multilingual model of PROJECT3, that language ID would not even. Be needed. So this is, like, we, need to, figure out. Building blocks. Yeah, so. So, like, please think about if, for a while. You have seen the sessions, you know what can happen. And, I think that we should have multi lingual, PROJECT9 models and either multi lingual PROJECT3. Or multiple PROJECT3 with this language ID all feeding into the same multi lingual PROJECT9 and then this PROJECT9. Producing English. And then from English, will go to all the, of the other languages. Does that make sense?",
            "I mean it kind of does, but it will like bias the translations. So. I mean, the quality is probably going to the deteriorate. Given the time.",
            "Yeah, not necessary for the for the multilingual models. It's a, it's. If it is a PROJECT12. It is should. Like it's. It is not. It's not PROJECT12, by having multiple concurrent inputs. It's multi, just, multilingual. I don't think, it, should deteriorate too much if it's if it's, three languages, at. The, at the beginning. And we don't have.",
            "I think. If I think ORGANIZATION11 or ORGANIZATION1 has done something like this. And they do not have an intermediate language. So it is direct from one language to another. Initially it was from the initial language to English and then to another language. But now they have another tool, which is essentially from one language to another language. It doesn't involve getting english in between. And, it proved to be more efficient than, putting English in between. So, English, as the intermediatory language. So, I mean to interpret - Or they talked about how the computer had learned to try, or to interprete. Or it created one language on it's own. Starter. So I understand too. It was early German and Spanish.",
            "So the machine was translating Spanish to something which only it. Knows and no one else. And there was converting it to German. So there was them. They were obviously a intermediate language, but that language was not, manually annotated. So, it is someone who knows, Czech. And no, who knows Spanish and, German both. So, he or she can directly translate from one language to another, withour using English as a. Derivatory language.",
            "Well, if you could find a reference to, this. Please, let me know. But, so far what you said, it seems to me, it is like, the general statement. That direct bilingual models are better, than models, than, output, that are. Pivoted. And I do not think that, this, is, an, ultimately, true statement. I think it very much depends on the data available. If you have good data for the language pair, then yes, it is better to go directly. But if your data is more available through English then it's it's better to go through English or. Synthetise the data for the direct language pair. And that's probably the best quality you can get. That you create synthetic corpora, based on English centric data set but you create then a. Direct model.",
            "So, it was not necessarily a bilingual, it was a multi lingual model.",
            "It was multi lingual. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, the input could be multi lingual as well as the output would be multi lingual. So I mean that's why it was interesting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will try to find it and send it to you.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you. So thanks, PERSON14, for, the write up. Yes, the book, we definitely have to have it out, in. In, the middle of the year so, probably we should start meeting on that and start, writing, Right after the subtitler study is, is a way.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay. So I think that is it for the call today. I'll try to record somewhat my suggestion about how to use the language ID in theirs that we have. In the document, and otherwise, have a good week and talk to you, next, Thursday, and be in touch, with, the preparations for the for the events so that is, and. The continuous evaluation. That is the, the ladder climbing is the most urgent thing now. Okay, so thanks a lot. Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Hi, PERSON2. Can you hear me?",
            "Yes, hi. How are you PERSON8?",
            "How are you doing? Today you came to ORGANIZATION16?",
            "Today, I am in the office today. I'm in the office.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "I just decided to enjoy walking here.",
            "Is PERSON3 joining us?",
            "Yeah, I was just going to message him that are we meeting today or not?",
            "And by the way did you do PERSON5, the annotator?",
            "No.",
            "PERSON3 was supposed to do here on Friday. Aha, I actually should ask PERSON3 about it. Well, okay. Let's wait for him.",
            "Should I call him, I think, is he joining?",
            "Probably yes. Thank you.",
            "He usually joins. He is not answering the call also. I hope everything is fine.",
            "Now he is not answering to the call. I just hope we will join soon. He joined. Hi PERSON3.",
            "Hi.",
            "Can you hear me? Hi.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Oh, okay. Oh, I missed your calls.",
            "Yes, I am so you are usually there on time. So I was wondering you didn't came. If everything is fine and you are joining or not.",
            "Oh no, everything is fine. Looks like we have to like replan everything now.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the thing is that we are not going for special sessions, right? What is the last mail. I think PERSON2 can translate that for us. What the person has written.",
            "That Czech text you mean.",
            "Yes.",
            "Nothing serious. I will translate it. That's actually not. And, thank you for the email, we had a te, tech a technical communication meeting. And, the results are the following: that their are papers for special sessions, should. Fill the same criteria as all other papers and the same timelines. So if you want. If you plan to make a special challenge session, you should, just follow these rules. And if it would be a satellite event. You should do what you want just coordinate it with something like two more. Higher. I do not know what is that. Un, important bit is that, the, the articles are not in the proceedings of. ORGANIZATION11.",
            "So I think the same, was written by PERSON7 as well.",
            "So I actually knew about this satellite event. So this is usually for some full fledged workshop. Not really for shared tasks, which are very focused. But, like this gives us much more flexibility and freedom to choose our event, or also like. Accept papers. But the thing is that we have to do much like almost double work with this.",
            "So that means it is going to be, like we are going to, handle the track alone, right, is. It? Is it so, or did I said yes? Did I understood everything?",
            "Yes, yes, everything. So it is like a mini conference. It is like a mini conference that you want to do.",
            "Okay.",
            "It is entirely independent of ORGANIZATION11. So program committee, key note speakers everything we have to choose, okay? And, then, like, ORGANIZATION11, will only be there. They will just promote our, workshop in their webpage and nothing else.",
            "Now, what do we do? Do we refine the proposal?",
            "Yes.",
            "For a satellite. The proposal is gonna be different?",
            "Yeah, there are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are many things now.",
            "PERSON4.",
            "We have to figure it out.",
            "PERSON3 may ask you, do you want to do that?",
            "Yeah, we don't have any option right now.",
            "But there. Another option is this next conference. I forgot ORGANIZATION9 or not ORGANIZATION9, something different.",
            "ORGANIZATION2.",
            "ORGANIZATION2. At ORGANIZATION2 we can make a shared task. Yes?",
            "Yes.",
            "And why not to do a shared task at ORGANIZATION2.",
            "I would propose both, PERSON2. We should do both. Like we don't know that. If we, if we apply this will get eventually accepted.",
            "Then what after? If we do not get in ORGANIZATION2 like, do we have some other option as well after ORGANIZATION2.",
            "We have to go on trying, we have to go for ORGANIZATION13. ORGANIZATION13 spoken language technology workshop. But I 'strongly feeling from, like whatever PERSON7 said that our, work is not exactly in. The domain of speech, it is PROJECT4. So, so, because there is nothing like no concept of speech here. We are directly working on text. So I'm resonating what PERSON7 said. But the thing is that the proposal for a ORGANIZATION7 workshop this year is over. Which was in September, which was too early for us. And the next proposal would come for 2022 would, which would be too late for us. So, PERSON2 what I would propose is. Like, eventually we have to try and see. Like, it's better that if we get either of the two, ORGANIZATION2 or ORGANIZATION11. Because both of them are well recognized in the community and our. Like we can motivate participants to submit.",
            "Okay.",
            "The only the only that I'm finding now is, going with ORGANIZATION11 is like they. Will not allow us a space in the proceedings, which may, deter some of the participants. Like, like, I am not sure that how much, how much they will be excited to publish a paper in. PROJECT3 or ORGANIZATION6 is a big no. So in ORGANIZATION6s people can publish any time, right? So that is not a benefit to their profiles. So how to motivate, participants to join our shared task. If there is no endorsement in proceedings from ORGANIZATION11. So this was the reason that I especially, vouched for the special session. But this time, the problem is. What I can understand is the last time that differ. The like, time periods between proposals, submission and your, final paper submission was. Five months. So it would have enough time for our shared task. But this time it is only three months, so. Yeah. That is one here.",
            "May I just make here one more thing.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "If we made this kind of workshop, the satellite. So we now make a proposal for the workshop. We either get it or not. If we get it, we write to our participants. So we make an advertisement. Please take part in the shared task. Or workshop. So they are supposed suppose during this three months to, write a program. So to make, this, minuting somehow.",
            "And write a paper also beforehand. During these three months, there plus a separate paper on the topic. At the same time, together with the shared task. Yes? Or how is it going to work?",
            "And so if we are going for special like. If you are if your proposal is accepted for a workshop, then we have much more independence. Than special session. So it is entirely up to us then, wha when to float the deadline. How should we do the review processes? Everything. So we are free to choose everything for this. But for the special session, we have to strictly follow whatever ORGANIZATION11 says there.",
            "We don't do the special session anymore. It's clear. I'm asking about the workshop.",
            "One more thing, which is coming to my mind is. If we have to prepare, like, in three months, like, like all the, if you are just emailing all the. Participants to take part into it. And is our data prepared for it? Because all the participants are going to, experiment with our data, right? They are supposed to prepare < / parallel _ speech.",
            "Yes, I think, like, in three months our data will be prepared. Like the proposal submission, the last date of submission, submitting the proposal is February. Twenty eight. And before that, we have to get an ISC endorsement that the speech community is endorsing our. Proposals. Then only we can submit, the workshop of proposal. And then they will let us know by March fifteen. So by March fifteen, we know that whether we are, we are accepted in ORGANIZATION11 workshops. And then we have to like, write our call for proposals and stuff. But before submitting the proposal, we have to get everything ready, like the website our. Program committee, key notes, the program, everything. And then only, we have to make a full fledged, proposal for like workshop program and then. Submit. And that would request time.",
            "That would request time.",
            "So but when is, when is the date, for submitting the full papers to participants. If we conduct a separate workshop.",
            "We can set it up.",
            "That is up to us.",
            "Up to us.",
            "That is up to us.",
            "Okay.",
            "I will be back in two minutes. Yes, I 'sorry, just.",
            "So it should be very much double work.",
            "Yeah. So.",
            "Like many things. I yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.",
            "So, right now, is the deadline the same? For the satellite, is it ninth?",
            "No, no, no, no, no. No, for the satellite event it is February twenty eight. But before that, we have to submit the proposal any time. Okay, like as soon as possible and get endorsement. And one of the endorsement is their. So there is two. One is endorsement from ORGANIZATION1 and when ORGANIZATION1 endorses we have to, submit. Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Submit and then they will say. So it is a long process now. But, that is ok. But my is, we have to now look for proceedings. Take care of all those stuff on our own.",
            "I know since I am like. I did this for the past year. It is too much heavy.",
            "And so anyway, we have prepared the, this document. We can send it to ORGANIZATION2, no, for the shared task.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. By January fifteenth.",
            "If they accept us both to ORGANIZATION2 and, this ORGANIZATION11. What does your?",
            "ORGANIZATION11. We do both.",
            "What?",
            "We do both.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Really?",
            "Yeah, see, eventually it will be online. So there is no travel. Just, like we have to manage this submission and do our thing. So, I think that better, PERSON7 will, will have a better say. But if you are to ask me. I will do both then. Because both have a very good visibility.",
            "Yes, but, can we find so many participants.",
            "I think so.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay.",
            "I think so. Because, since it would be entirely on to us, we don't need twelve submission. We can even do with five, six submissions.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like, I have seen workshops in ORGANIZATION3 having two or three submissions only. So still, they are doing the proceedings and stuff. So, that's not a problem.",
            "So, PERSON3 you are here to go to both. And to begin with, workshop now.",
            "Yes, yeah, but it, but it means double work. That is what.",
            "Yes I understand, but you are very good.",
            "My response.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "He just replied to that email.",
            "I talked to him, and there was some things. And he just said \"Agreed\".",
            "Yeah. He just said \"Agreed\". So I thought, that is a new information.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I think I need to settle down a bit. Last three, four days, it was too much hectic for me. I like had to reorient everything. Okay, so, like. The thing is that our proposal is almost, near to complete. But we have to take out institutional membership. For like, for like, for all of us, to submit to the ORGANIZATION1 workshop administration portal. So for this, PERSON2, I shou I should contact PERSON7 right?",
            "I missed the point. Sorry.",
            "So we, we have to take a membership to submit the proposal.",
            "What is membership.",
            "Membership to ORGANIZATION1.",
            "I do not know, really. PERSON3 don't don't ask me about these administrative plants. I have no idea.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So I can make the data. I can read the texts, but I can never. So, or understand this organizational things.",
            "Okay, no, I'm just asking, suppose PERSON2 where, we have to pay some fees somewhere for our. Workshop. To whom should I ask. Like, if we have to ask PERSON7, right?",
            "Yes, aha, PERSON7 and he will forward you to PERSON6.",
            "Okay, okay, I got it. So we have to pay two forty Euros for institutional membership, maybe.",
            "Yeah, yes, I think it's not a problem at all. But, ask, PERSON7.",
            "Okay, okay. So do you want to discuss about the proposal content for the workshop now or?",
            "No, I don't know what.",
            "Okay, so let me prepare this as part of the content that is required. I have to study some, other satellite events that I got accepted to an ORGANIZATION11 last year. So we have taken reorient in these things. And the, the additional thing we have to have to do ORGANIZATION4 management, and, ORGANIZATION4 management and especially we have to invite the program committee now. And to make a website for our propo, for our shared task.",
            "Yes.",
            "And what else? Interesting..",
            "Yeah, it is really big work all of it.",
            "And, another thing, PERSON2 so, can you tell us a bit more about ORGANIZATION8? And I was, I 'like not aware of this journal.",
            "I would. I would rather advise you to ORGANIZATION5it. I do not know, much more.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "I 'not really interested in all these points. I have never searched of that. So I probably published there something once or twice. But, I didn't make a reche, a research about, what is.",
            "So it is from ORGANIZATION16. Okay.",
            "I don't know. Probably not just that. Probably there is some points, I don't know which points. Really don't ask me about it. I don't follow.",
            "Either ORGANIZATION5it or ask PERSON7.",
            "Yeah, I got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "These are things that I never understand.",
            "Um-hum, okay. So PERSON7 is the technical editor, so it makes sense.",
            "Yeah, probably. Yeah, I'm very, very anti-organisational type.",
            "Which journal?",
            "The ORGANIZATION8.",
            "Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Have you ever read it?",
            "Yeah, yeah, actually. Very good papers. This machine translation got published in it. So I have read about it.",
            "So is this?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So do you think that like, the participants would be interested, for a publication in. This, in this journal?",
            "It depends on, depends on the participants actually.",
            "Oh, because I have never heard of it. I know I have, in like in my, research duration. I have read lots of papers.",
            "So I think machine translation is.",
            "I think it will be mostly focused on machine translation.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That is why I think I have experience with it.",
            "But it is very old. It was published in 1964.",
            "Yes, actually the like. Like all the statistical machine translation, all the paper. The core papers were actually in this. So, I read lots of those papers.",
            "Okay.",
            "So they can be interested. You know, it depends upon person to person. So if he is aware of this, then I think he can be interested in. If he is not aware, then probably you know. It really depends.",
            "And is it indexed? Or. Let me see.",
            "I think it was indexed, in like all ORGANIZATION5 and all that. But let us give it some.",
            "Okay.",
            "I think editorial board members are really, interesting to see.",
            "PERSON7 is there so that is good.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So anyway. So I think, this would be easy for us, like if we have to do ORGANIZATION8. Um-hum.",
            "Yeah, even if you see to the website of it. They have mentioned that machine translation corpus linguist PERSON1 morphology, syntax and. Semantics is what.",
            "But I 'trying to look at the where it is indexed. Because, you know, like, to a new person, they would probably go for where it is indexed.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So in ORGANIZATION12 it is not indexed.",
            "It is not mentioned on the website, I wonder why. So one good thing for, going for and would be, if we go for. The proceedings would be indexed with ORGANIZATION3 anthology.",
            "That is a good. That is a good positive point.",
            "I would say that the is better than ORGANIZATION11 workshop.",
            "Yeah, less work.",
            "This is a little less work and intent and more intensive output.",
            "Yes, I agree. Okay, so it is indexed in ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Yeah, ORGANIZATION5 I have seen. Thank you. Despite of that.",
            "So it is mostly on machine translation. It is already, written in there.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "In their description. Okay.",
            "Yeah, and it will be like.",
            "But I don't see any kind of like proceedings in this journal.",
            "Proceedings.",
            "Proceedings of any workshop or something, it was not there.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, any kind. In any kind of conference or workshop, yes.",
            "Okay. But I think if we are to do it PERSON7 will take care of that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So.",
            "Did he mention it in some email? Did I skip something? Did he mention that we are going to publish in the proceedings?",
            "Yes, he says, that either we can go for ORGANIZATION6 or we can go for ORGANIZATION8. So, but ORGANIZATION6 is no, because, yeah, it. It won't motivate anyone to submit.",
            "So I think, ORGANIZATION8 is very famous to the entire machine translation community at least.",
            "Community, right.",
            "Yeah, so, not aware of the other summarisation and all people.",
            "Yeah, that's the point.",
            "So maybe we can try it.",
            "Light of. I, I kn I know something called, PROJECT1 from ORGANIZATION14. So PROJECT1 is something where they host. They like they can host. The proceedings of some conferences and workshops. But I 'not sure that if they will charge for that. And if they charge how much is the charge.",
            "SRN also has some specific or those. Oh, for that, like a what they have, the general specific journals. Like applied science and something there are after a certain there is specific something. So are you talking about something specific.",
            "No. I'm talking about PROJECT1 ORGANIZATION14, PROJECT1 conference proceedings from ORGANIZATION14.",
            "Let me post the link.",
            "And where is it indexed?",
            "Yeah, they will be indexed in, ORGANIZATION5, all the major. Industry services.",
            "Okay, maybe we can ask PERSON7 I think about this.",
            "Yeah, let me let me scan it to.",
            "It was ORGANIZATION15 indexed, I guess.",
            "ORGANIZATION15 yes, it will definitely will be because it is from ORGANIZATION14. But I think it would also be indexed in others like or something.",
            "Um-hum like, if I would have been so, I would have actually preferred a PROJECT2 over PROJECT1.",
            "PROJECT2 over PROJECT1.",
            "Because I have read actually like four papers. So I have like a very good image of PROJECT2.",
            "Of PROJECT2 okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.",
            "The quality of paper is very good, which I've have read.",
            "Yeah, for machine translation?",
            "Yes.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "And PROJECT2 is also an open index.",
            "Open access right?",
            "Yeah, open access. And, it is indexed by. Directly.",
            "Okay, you checked it?",
            "Yes, I checked it from the website of that.",
            "Okay.",
            "That can be one, positive point about it that it is open access.",
            "Yes. Okay. So another thing, another thing that we can do. But I have to ask like we can, we can also do it as part of the forum. I think so. I have to ask my other co-editors, if that is possible. Oh, so forum has a very big visibility among the IRN and PROJECT4 community. Okay, okay. So I think maybe we can defer this discussion with PERSON7. You could propose something better? Anything else we had to discuss today? I think it was mostly the proposal, right? So that we are not doing. So we have to revise this and list down the thing that we need to do for, the satellite event. Okay. Then, do we meet tomorrow then? Maybe by tomorrow, I can come up with something that what are the additional works, we need to. Do.",
            "Yes. PERSON3 thank you very much for willing to do that. I am sorry that I can't help you on this stage so I really, I have been.",
            "No, no, it's absolutely okay PERSON2.",
            "I will - I would be really glat to help in some contextual things I will really. I will be glad to read the proposal and to, to write some chapters to the proposal, so.",
            "For sure, yeah. Sure, sure.",
            "I think it i quite, yeah.",
            "PERSON2, your input is absolutely necessary at every point. The only thing is. Like, everything is okay. The only thing is, we have to do double work, that is the thing. Otherwise, everything is fine.",
            "Yes, yes, unfortunately, it is double work. Okay, thank you.",
            "Okay, okay. So we meet tomorrow. Okay.",
            "Good luck. Yeah.",
            "You too, you too.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Okay, okay. Bye then.",

            "Hi PERSON2.",
            "Okay, it works.",
            "Yes, it works.",
            "Hello. Hello.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah, sorry, for the delay and sorry for the complications. I had a ORGANIZATION12 call this morning with this cell phone, and it worked. And I don ´ t know, why it doesn ´ t work at the moment. I ´ on - Yeah, sorry. So I ´ I ´ I ´ back. It ´ s - The kids have taken all my, all my computers and I left with, with the cellphone only. So I can not share the ORGANIZATION2 doc - But - Well, I hope that everybody's looking at the ORGANIZATION2 doc. And thanks to all who joined, so to explain to especially PERSON15and PERSON10 who didn ´ t - And maybe PERSON7, who didn ´ t have the experience with these calls last summer. The goal is to synchronize the group, and the date and time, the so the day and time of the week is chosen, so that it is fits to most of us. And we if we see that the, the participation is, falling down, because people ´ s schedules changed. Then we will run, or we will update that call again and we ´ ll choose maybe a different slot. And, those who cannot attend, for a particular week, that ´ s not a problem at all. Like if randomly you can not attend, no worries, instead of excusing yourself just enter your details in the shared document before the call. And that ´ s it. That serves as an excuse already. So, otherwise these calls are very important, especially to reconnect with people, that, ere somewhat, like stranded alone for a longer while. So one of those is PERSON11, for example, so I would later ask PERSON11 to, to give us a brief summary of what he has been working on for the past months actually.And what he is he up to.And, there will be a lot of connection with, lot of connections with everything what he do. And one more, comment from myself. This call is being recorded, I hope you don ´ t mind. And, we are, hoping that will be allowed by you have to use these calls for the meeting summarization, so, the - Fe if you agree now, like please keep participating in the call, and the consent that you are giving by your participation now is not to publish the data yet. It ´ s only consent to process the data within the team. So we will be processing the data. We ´ ll be anonymizing these calls, so we ´ ll be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholders and so. And then once the data is anonymized or pseudonymized so, it ´ s like full anonymization is actually not possible. Because you could be always identified by your background. But, but the text will not contain any clear links to you. So it would be, pseudonymized. After this we ´ ll ask you again, to give us a permission to, to use this in the, for the sum meeting summarization purposes. So - Yeah. That ´ s about recording. And the, the warning that I have to say before we go into the individual, individual report is that, there is the ORGANIZATION7 conference. I think it ´ s early December. So less than month from now, and we should, get ready for that, because, this ORGANIZATION7 conference will serve as a test, event for us. We should be as prepared as we would be for the main ORGANIZATION16 Congress. And this year we have, asked ORGANIZATION7 to only allow us to connect to their - I think it would be ORGANIZATION12, oh, ORGANIZATION12 to only connect and show the subtitle somewhere on the side, quite silently without much publicity. And if the ORGANIZATION16 Congress is actually not happening. Then we will use the next year's ORGANIZATION7 as our main, demo event for the PROJECT5 project. So it is an important exercise. It will be with limited or no audience this year, probably. But it ´ s at least like sympathetic audience. I ´ s all MLT researchers. So they will understand what are the problems of the technology. But we need to get ready for that, because it ´ s is a serious demo. So, so, well we ´ ll be working - Everyone of you will be working somehow to, to help with this as you are working that anyway. Okay, so that ´ s enough from me. And I would like now, I would like to ask PERSON11 now to start, because he has been the most, remote for a while.",
            "Hello. Can you hear me, see me?",
            "Yes. Yes, I don ´ t see you, but -",
            "Okay.",
            "I could see you.",
            "That ´ s a problem.",
            "Yes, so - Actually I don ´ t know what was the last time when I was, on this call. But so - The first thing actually that I have been working since on this calls was the paraphrasing. Which is that I was using the rainbow model for paraphrasing for, for PERSON1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then since then I haven ´ t actually been working on so much. But there have been some things since I didn ´ t have really, so many instructions. So one thing that, I have been working on is, is actually trying to collect the data that we can use - The monolingual data that we can use, for this rainbow models. And for this I have actually found - I have I have a - Because like the problem is that we need the domain specific data and -",
            "I have - So, I have been thinking that well - So at first, I tried, actually filtering, some other data sets that already exists. Such as - Such as common crawl and so on. But I found that it is actually quite a problem to find spoken data there. Since it ´ s - Usually web pages. So, so what I thought is that I would - I would go over some, some more pages, wer where there are actually some videos, and to download transcripts from there. And so for this, I tried, to go to ORGANIZATION10. And I actually discovered that you can scrape, subtitles from these, courses, Which are actually in, like multiple languages. So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this way I obtained - Yes, so in the free version there are some limitations. So I only obtained to scrape a small data set like one hundred thousand sentences, which could like be used for testing. But still, it ´ s something and otherwise I didn ´ t find out any -",
            "Any other ideas so - So any s any suggestions would be welcome.",
            "The ORGANIZATION6. ORGANIZATION6corpus.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yo are you in touch with PERSON13?",
            "Yes, so, so I received the e mail from him. And I didn ´ t look at it yet.",
            "Aha. Please do it. So - So yes.",
            "Yeah. So this would be an parallel corpus. Yes, so - Yes, so I have to get in touch with him. But I had a lot of to do to do in the past week. So I kind of didn ´ t -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Didn ´ t continue with this. So I will write to him as soon as possible. And also what I have actually discovered is that ORGANIZATION2 - It ´ s not ORGANIZATION2 sorry, ORGANIZATION15.",
            "ORGANIZATION15.",
            "Actually -",
            "They release some data.",
            "They released a data and a model. So what they released is - So first what they released is actually an algorithm for mining parallel data in one hundred languages.",
            "Not English-centric. But actually between all of those, English languages. And only I don ´ t know one third of it is English-centric.",
            "So I have been looking at this, and they have also released - Basically they haven ´ t released the data yet, I think, but they have also released the trained models. And I have I have been evaluating that trained models on our testing data.",
            "And the models are really huge. It ´ s like sixteen billion parameters.",
            "But actually, actually, I have discovered that on some, on some of our testing data sets from PROJECT6. They are actually not much better than - Even not better than the best Edinburgh model. Probably because they didn ´ t train on spoken data. And also like they are very tricky to run, because you need like for GPUs with sixteen gigabytes of RAM at least. And it takes like up to a minutes to translate just one hundred sentences. So for us they are quite useless and - What would probably be the most useful is actually the data. So that we can, use it to - So can you - So that we can adapt their data collection, for some kind of spoken data. Otherwise it didn ´ t really works so much better. Which quite suprised me. But maybe, on testing data in other low research languages it will be better. I don ´ t know, just -",
            "Yeah. Can you hear me it?",
            "Yes.",
            "Does it work at all? Yes. You can hear me right. So this is, that is a long report and lot of work planned and lot of work done. So the evaluation - So I would like to highlight the high level thing - So we need monolingual data for, domain adaptation. So in the domain to create synthetic data, based on that, we need parallel data as much as possible. And there please get in touch, and really continue and finish the ORGANIZATION6corpus that was started -",
            "PERSON13 last year already, and we never got to finish that. And these huge models, that ´ s excellent. The idea that I have there is that we could use them for, teacher student. So we could distill smaller model from that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that -",
            "This could totally work.",
            "Yeah, so that is something that we should, we should consider this like next the possible thing to do.",
            "And the evaluation is more important. So with the evaluation I would like you to, test the evaluation, using PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT3 and in on the call I saw - Now it doesn ´ t really work for me the ORGANIZATION12 is kind of stuck. But we have PERSON8 here, and he is overseeing the development of the PROJECT3. And, we have, so. Who is now responsible most for the PROJECT5 test set. It used to be PERSON9, but, he is giving that to - Is that you PERSON15, is that you? Or are we kind of, in a post phase with the PROJECT5test set.",
            "I don ´ t know.",
            "You ´ re not on that. Okay. So that is kind of in the, in like hanging in the air. Because PERSON9 is moving more towards system integration. And, PERSON6 who has worked on the PROJECT5test set will join us only from December. Will rejoin us. Because he is busy with other things. But the PROJECT5 test set is there and, so maybe if, PERSON8 can briefly summarize the status of the PROJECT2. And the connection to PROJECT5 test set.",
            "And maybe if someone could send me the - Actually the status of the test set or some links or something.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, so hi everbody. About PROJECT2 PROJECT5 test set. I think the current version of - First of all PERSON12 wanted to attend the call but he had problem with ORGANIZATION5 so he wrote his report there. And I will speak on behalf of him also. There - So the PROJECT5, the PROJECT2 is completely finished. And as I said you PERSON3, it ´ s now workig wi - For example, it ´ s working with alignment by - I mean if they are inside in PROJECT5 test set.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we created one, index, new index, if you see, I put the name of the next inside the call, inside the, you know, ORGANIZATION2 doc. I think front of my name I wrote if I remember. Okay so if you see, we created a new index. The name is ORGANIZATION6 for PROJECT2. And also only that files are created in another documents. It ´ s, independent from the others. So I commited it in the PROJECT5 test set. And just I wanted to wanted to ask you, if you have just you know free time, for around one hour. We can run PROJECT2 on data and see the result and, you know, make the final agreement if you want to do some minor changes. I can do it. And then it ´ s ready and we can you know publish it.",
            "Deploy - Publish it, yeah. So the - Yeah, so the - For everybody, the general idea behind this PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT2 is that we would like to make it the standard evaluation tool. Not just for us, and not just for the PROJECT5 project, but also for others doing a spoken language translation. And the PROJECT5 test set contains the input texts and references and also input sounds and reference transcripts. Th so, well look up that ORGANIZATION9 hub repository and, PROJECT2 is the tool, which uses - It can use any other inputs and references, but it is also directly capable downloading what, files you want to evaluate on from PROJECT5 test set. Similarly ORGANIZATION17, is like now the standard for WMT evaluation of Blair and other scores. So we would like to do this for, the spoken language translation, and also including machine translation, because its broader domain. Broader range of domains than what the S, what the ORGANIZATION17 has. So everybody who is evaluating something and that is PERSON11 with the ORGANIZATION15 models PERSON11 with, your previous, multilingual models. Then PERSON4 with his multilingual model that he is going to develop. Then PROJECT5 with all the pipeline. And I'm happy also to see Sa PERSON14 here on the on the call. So PERSON14 can help with that, to - So PERSON10 and PERSON14 to evaluate all the workers that are in the PROJECT5 pipeline. All that should go through PROJECT5, be evaluated through PROJECT5, test set using PROJECT2. So please, everybody get in touch with PERSON8 directly, and get it s. Like, like find a way in which this tool will work for all of you. And the, so - Now we ´ re doing this like stress test within the consortium. And what PERSON8 was talking about that is the plan to publish it finally at, at a conference. So we have already sent it once. And it was, like not quite finished. And we sent it for the second time, and it is also not quite finished. So, we have, another chance in January as a demo paper. So for that, we would really like to have it, very nicely commented in a paper. Documented in a paper, and we also want to include some real evaluation in that paper to show that it is useful. And, PERSON8 for this moment, selected the ORGANIZATION6, data. So that would be like the test case of the evaluation for the purposes of the publication of the PROJECT2. But if any of your, evaluations would, would be like more interesting than we could switch to this other use case, so that ´ s - In any case this is a big request from me. Everybody who are, evaluating any systems, please make sure to evaluate them using PROJECT2 on PROJECT5test set. There will be bugs. There will be like strange results. But this is exactly what we want to go through. We want to fix these bugs and we want to, get numbers and repeated measurements so that the number stabilize, and we and we trust that. And also PERSON5 - So you could also evaluate your PROJECT4 systems on PROJECT2.",
            "Yes, it ´ s possible, because it ´ s set as PROJECT4, but PERSON3, in the current version, because I disabled there you know what ´ s the name - It works off-line. But only with the files inside the PROJECT5 test set.",
            "Yes.",
            "But you - Okay, but you want the previous version also, because you said in your you know when we were talking - You said when you were talking you said: It works independently, without any.",
            "Yes.",
            "Do you prefer to have both of them?",
            "So I think it should be the same tool, and it should try to connect to the ORGANIZATION5and download it. Download the PROJECT5 test set when you ask for that. So it should be -",
            "When we ask for theth.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. It ´ s the same way -",
            "It ´ s a same way as ORGANIZATION17. ORGANIZATION17 also works like independently or you can ask it to provide -",
            "Okay. Small changes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, I see. Okay, so the main question. Could you please check - Because I arrived and I ´ in Czech and I ´ working on my things. But whenever you have time, I prefer to talk with you around half an hour to an hour to finalize it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I prefer next week is very - Today I 'co I'm coming to university. I will come ORGANIZATION3, I will if you are in ORGANIZATION3 - I will go to ORGANIZATION3. But, I think next week is very suitable for me, whenever you have time -",
            "Yeah. Next week will be better.",
            "Yes.",
            "For me as well.",
            "Okay, so let me -",
            "Yeah, great.",
            "Okay. And about the paper also as you remember I put some fears there and I ´ waiting for your feedback.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "I thank you - Okay. So maybe next week, when, we see we can finalize everything.",
            "Yeah, okay. Great. Yeah. So now, there is many of you and we have only eight minutes left -",
            "Okay.",
            "I would really like to keep these calls short. So who is the most lost? Please Who doesn ´ t know what to work on. Who is most like who feels most disconnected from the, from the goal of - Yeah.",
            "Yes, so I ´ like completely lost here, because one of my lectures is scheduled so I ´ attending lecture as well as the meeting. So I have been looking here and there. Quite many times. So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah. At the moment I don ´ t know what I should work on, and, who - With whom I should, maybe -",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Work with. So yeah - I ´ d be really happy if you just -",
            "Yeah. So please talk directly to PERSON10, and help PERSON10 with all what he is lost in. And the most urgent thing to do is getting the evaluation of the of all the systems, of all the components from the, mediator, all the connected workers, running through PROJECT5 test set. So we need this cruise control. The true regular evaluation of all the systems. This is the most urgent thing. And this is what PERSON10is now also working on.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So please talk - You don ´ t have to - So, that ´ s like this these conflicts with like regular lectures, let ´ s - Your lecture has a p has a priority higher priority than this call. So, like we will try to accommodate to that, by maybe js a searching for new slot later on. Or simply having you represented only through your notes. So it ´ not - I don ´ t want you to skip any of your school duties and that implies to everybody of course.",
            "Yes..",
            "So please get in touch with PERSON10 separately -",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And, the urgent most thing indeed -",
            "Just - Yeah.",
            "Ebrahim, okay?",
            "I ´ sorry because just PERSON12 asked me to ask you about the censorship pipeline and because he is waiting for it.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "And if you if you have any answer for him I can tell him or you can send e-mail about it later.",
            "Yes. So that ´ s that ´ s another topic that is very much linked toward - PERSON4 is like, putting together, and also what, what PERSON9 would be kind of doing. But, the censorship component is something which we want to have as a one part of the pipeline after the PROJECT4. And also another one, after the machine translation. And the goal of this censorship tool is to allow to immediately hide the outputs and then show them again. So there has to be some hidden user interface in which the, the operator of the system checks what are the current outputs. And he re-enables those or he can also manually switch it off, when the automatic, trigger didn ´ t fire. When it didn ´ t see anything bad, but there was something bad. So it ´ s like - It ´ s not really editing of the life outputs, it ´ s just disabling of the outputs, for a moment. And, so - I thing that the best, sorry because as you see, I'm unable to respond in time. So the best thing would be if PERSON12, PERSON14, PERSON10and perhaps PERSON15 as well had a separate technical call on the design of this. And that PERSON12 implemented that tool, right?",
            "It ´ s good. I think it ´ s the best idea. So if San PERSON14could you hear me?",
            "Yeah. I can hear you.",
            "Okay, so if it is possible please contact PERSON12 and ask him for this call and if you want I can also attend the call to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just and for example to -",
            "Yeah. And from the management point of view, PERSON14 and PERSON10 should be the two kind of replaceable persons. Because PERSON10 is taking over what PERSON14 did. PERSON14 has limited capacity. So PERSON10 and PERSON14 are technically the same person there. They just are.",
            "Okay.",
            "On totally different places different places on the Earth, but you know. But that ´ s that ´ s okay. Okay.",
            "Okay. So you said PERSON14, PERSON10, PERSON12 and?",
            "Maybe PERSON15.",
            "Okay, PERSON15, PERSON15.",
            "Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you. So then is the, the second next lost person?",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay, great. Hi PERSON4. So to give everybody brief summary. PERSON4 has worked on multi-target machine translation for his master thesis. Which has been successfully defended in, in the starting the summer. And, now he, is also partly part-time employed on PROJECT5 to develop multi source, models. To find up the set up. And was there any other, type of model that we wanted you to train, or was it just this one?",
            "Currently we wanted to, abandon the multitarget set up and to, concentrate as you assume multi source set up. And so far I only reselected some experiments on that suspect cluster and only have just for the ORGANIZATION3 cluster access.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So not very much of progress so far. I have asked - My task were so far to generate synthetic multi-source train set. And for this purpose, I asked PERSON11 for model and he sent me the -",
            "Great.",
            "The place where it is.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But when I will receive the cluster access I will check this out.",
            "Yeh, so they should happen soon. I ´ I ´ sorry bu it ´ s a -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It ´ s just that still the paperwork is still in the process.",
            "It ´ s still in the process. Okay, because I written there considering it is probably already okay to write them. So -",
            "Yeah, I ´ ll I ´ ll double check, today, if it ´ s already processed enough.",
            "Yeah, but just in case that -",
            "Somebody -",
            "To have access to the system and cluster so I can do something what I can do there.",
            "Okay. How many GPUs can you run at one, at once?",
            "It ´ s two GPUs per machine.",
            "Okay. So it ´ s not for 8 GPUs.",
            "No.",
            "Well -",
            "But there some larger.",
            "PERSON3? What is the - What is the memory of those GPUs?",
            "Like this cluster is full. This kind of - You know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is it is hard to receive more than one GPU there.",
            "Okay, yes, so let ´ s wait for our cluster. I also started with multi-source synthetic corpus. And I and I think we need to do itterative back translation on Czech German news to have some higher quality in German-Czech news corpus. And then we can combine it with English Czech, which is already high quality from PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then we can -",
            "So the models have to be of comparable quality, so that the, the multi-source has a chance to be useful, right? Is that the idea?",
            "Probably yes. And also we can take a look in the - And I can also send you how they do this data collection in ORGANIZATION6, if that would help. Or -",
            "So maybe you can discuss like directly after the call. So let ´ s keep this call running for longer, but let ´ s finish the common part. For the common part I would just like to highlight the one more thing. And it ´ s PERSON7and PERSON15. Both of you should be working now on that multilingual PROJECT4 systems, right? Is that kind of, of the current summary or are you more working on, s whatever data augmentation for PROJECT4 or - So maybe PERSON7?",
            "Well, I'm working on the chopped data set as already -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Already told you. Yeah. So it is kind of I don ´ t know whether it ´ s strictly -",
            "The data augmentation.",
            "But yeah, yeah. It ´ s rather data augmentation.",
            "For better PROJECT4. And your model is only for offline processing? So, How far did you get with the onlinezation? Because that is something which we would - If your model, evaluates well, using PROJECT2 on PROJECT5 test set, we would like to have that integrated. But I know that it ´ s, behaved differently. It doesn ´ t emit word by word. So. If we have anyone with the capacity and the best person will be probably PERSON10. Then it would be great to, like ask someone to help you, for example PERSON10, to help you, with the onlinezation of your model. So please keep that in mind, that we want to evaluate your model and if it looks good, then we want to have that integrated.",
            "Yes, the question is whether we would want to use just a ORGANIZATION1as a model. The CTC end-to-end model or we want to use the extended one, the cascaded model from my thesis. The, the ORGANIZATION1, translates phonemes and then followed by transform.",
            "Whichever evaluates better in the offline run.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "The ev the evaluation of the offline runs is, is the deciding thing. And I would like, to ask Umar to also work on the, on the same data and keep training. The ORGANIZATION13 set up, right?",
            "Yeah, so people are disappearing. Thank you for your participation. That ´ s okay. Thank you very much. And, just PERSON15 just stay here with PERSON7Peter for second. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "So whenever PERSON7, whenever you have the data ready, please get in touch with PERSON15. PERSON16 also please, train as a comparin comparison in using the exact same training data, exact of evaluation you two please be t in touch together. So that, s we have this old style cascaded, the new style cascaded possibly, and, the simple ORGANIZATION1only wou on the same augmented data set evaluated ehagainst each other.",
            "Okay.",
            "Right? Yeah, so I think - Yeah?",
            "I have one more idea for PERSON4.",
            "Okay.",
            "You can try some transfer learning on of double encoder model on small GPus. So if we have trained model for English-Czech and German-Czech, then you can try to copy the parameters one encoder to the double encoder model. From one model.",
            "And that ´ s continue training on the multi-source data. So that it ´ s pre-trained and it doesn ´ t like waste too much time in the in double encoder.",
            "Yes then we can experiment with this on small models and small GPUs at first, and then -",
            "Yes. So that ´ s definitely - Yes. This is a general recommendation that holds for everybody who is trying to, put together new things. Always try it with small models and small data, and only once it works technically and does something very useful or on this very small data set. Then use it, also applied on the large data. Yeah, okay.",
            "So PERSON4, if you ´ re interested and I can write you some points how to start. You can contact me by e-mail.",
            "Can you can you also maybe, if you are doing some communication. Can you maybe just g send the copy to me so that I know what models you are working on since I'm working on similarly on some multi-targeted models.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah, oka.y. So I ´ ll have to leave myself at this moment as well. So thank you very much for this call. I know it was very packed. And some of you have had only like few seconds of like, strict things strictly relevant to you. But it will get better, in the coming weeks as we like synchronize more. So the purpose of this meeting was, very greatly fulfilled. So thank you again, and please, do the discussions, pairwise or in small teams as we have discussed. I ´ ll now leave the call myself. And, so who was, supposed to keep talking. Please keep talking on this call, feel free to do that. What ´ s what ´ s that.",
            "So I also have to leave, my lecture is ongoing and I have, said my part and I know what I should do next. And whom I should get connected with so I ´ ll do all of these things after the lecture.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Sorry for -",
            "Yeah, that ´ s that ´ s okay. Thank you. Bye PERSON14.",
            "Thank you and bye.",
            "Yeah. So bye everybody. Yeah, thank you. Bye.",
            "PERSON7 can you stay for a while.",
            "So PERSON7 is staying, right? PERSON5 and PERSON16, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I'm making now PERSON7the host of this call. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "PERSON15 you wanted to ask something.",
            "Yes. I have one or two - So first of all I need on which you ´ re working can you share the path with me?",
            "Yes sure. What I ´, really, working on is, like call it there chopped data set and with that I ´ using regular, speech data set. ORGANIZATION11Common voice. And what I'm trying to do is to is to chop the utterences to words. So I ´ using first alignment and, what I what I ´ want to do is to chop the utterences and recreate new sentences using the words itself. So it has - From my point of view it has, few at, few. Few things that can improve the, improve the robustness of the PROJECT4. And it is that, we can we can leverage more, non-native dat non-native speakers, as we can reuse more frequently the words, spoken by non-natives. And also we can, create wholly new sentences, because, when you ´ re training end to end PROJECT4, which is my case. The model is, train not only the pronuncation model, but also the language model. And this is especially hard, if we have only few data. And that ´ s actually the case of ORGANIZATION11 Common voice.",
            "Because, there are too many, you sentence, ther that ´ s same or and they are just spoken by or read, because it ´ s actually read data set. And these same sentences are, read by, several speakers. And that ´ s why the models which are trained only on common voice are quite bad. Because the there are f only few sentences and the language model is quite bad then.",
            "So it ´ s that non-native data set?",
            "Well, it ´ s partially non-native, partially native. I ´ I don ´ t know the exact statistics. I can I can I can checkt it.",
            "Are you working on the same task which was due to the ORGANIZATION14challenge?",
            "Sorry, once again, because I didn ´ t understand.",
            "I ´ saying that are you working on the same, sorry. Are you working on the same thing that was due in ORGANIZATION14 challenge or is it something else?",
            "Well, it ´ s not the Interspeech challenge, because it was due twentieth of September. I guess. But, it ´ s actually very similar. I got the data from the challenge. And I don ´ t know whether we can use these data.",
            "Okay.",
            "I have to check I have to check whether we are allowed to use these data. But, but for example, there are in the in the ORGANIZATION11 Common voice data set there are twenty three percent United States English. Then there ´ s eight percent England English, five percent India and South Asia accent, four percent Australian English, three percent Canadian, two percent Scottish. One percent Irish, one percent Southern African and one percent New Zealand English. On the data set also contains information about age and gender. Not all - Not all not all the data points have these, these attributes, but some of them do have. And, that ´ s why I'm using this data set. But very probably there ´ s even better data set that we can use for this.",
            "So I understand that but I couldn ´ t understand the main the main objective is it to train PROJECT7 in English PROJECT4? Is it so?",
            "Well, the main objective is to train a robust PROJECT4.",
            "Robust English PROJECT4. And what does the robust means? Robust to the more -",
            "Ro. Robust towards accents and, mainly accents, but also generally robust by, creating, new sentences. Or new sentences or - Using sentences that were not in the original data set. So because, there is a lots of textual written data sets. Or we can we can use for example subtitles which is written spoken langu written, written spoken language data set. And we can try to synthetize, using the existing words this new data sets. Even though we don ´ t have the original speech data.",
            "It ´ s oh, so which toolkit are you using?",
            "Which to?",
            "Toolkit. Which toolkit are you using?",
            "I am using the ORGANIZATION4toolkit.",
            "Okay, fine. So didn ´ t PERSON3 mention something with multi-lingual PROJECT4, or - I ´ I got wrong.",
            "Well I should be I should start to work on multi-lingual PROJECT4, but, this - Because I ´ still at home and I, do not have much time to work. So I ´ this, what I ´ really doing now and, probably next week I ´ ll be in Prague and I ´ ll start to work more hard and maybe then I ´ ll I ´ ll be - I ´ ll start with the wil with the multi-lingual PROJECT4. And -",
            "I would just confused that what he is actually waiting from - He was something mentioning about the comparing the performance of your system with something. So was he talking about the this multi accented PROJECT4 or was he talking of multi-lingual PROJECT4?",
            "He was probably thinking the PROJECT4 I created or ri I ´ ll I ´ ve been using during my master thesis. And - That was - Well, I was using, the original, PROJECT4 provided by ORGANIZATION8. And I fine tuned it to - Because it ´ s end-to-end model I fine tuned it to recognize phonemes exe, rather than graphemes. And I, trained my own transfomer model that would translate the phonemes into graphemes and add, punctuation and, also to recover some errors. That were in the transcripts. So maybe he ´ s thinking about this.",
            "So that was an English PROJECT4?",
            "English and Czech.",
            "Okay, okay. I think I need to work on whatever he was thinking about so I will just maybe first to the path of data from. And to evaluate the PROJECT4. So I need just, use the same data for ORGANIZATION13 evaluations. Does it make sense?",
            "Yes, yes. So, what are the tasks we need to do - Well - There ´ s these there are the data from the ORGANIZATION14 challenge and we need to we need to check whether we can use these data.",
            "But I'm afraid that these data are just, private and we cannot use them. But we need to check.",
            "I mean, if they there is something what he want So I can ask him once again. I know I ´ bit confused.",
            "And what next. And of course, I ´ ll I ´ ll have to use the common voice and maybe I ´ ll check fo another multilingual data set. But, I guess the ORGANIZATION11Common voice is the best option as. If I recall correctly, the most papers that work with accented speech, were are working with the Common voice data set.",
            "That ´ s bad. I think will multilingual through different things. Isn ´ t it so?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Multi-lingual are different, and well, multi-accented are different. Maybe I have said wrong word. But I meant, multi-accented.",
            "Okay, so if that was that requirement, then please share the with me of the data set. We train the set and we test it. And this will be ORGANIZATION13 again or same model. And then we - I think we can compare the of more systems.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I'm leaving a message for you on.",
            "Well, if it ´ s okay for you I ´ not - I rather use mail. If it ´ s okay for you.",
            "Okay, that ´ s that ´ s. I ´ ll then, leave the message for you on mail and whenever you have time.",
            "Okay, so I guess I think is evertyhing.",
            "Is there anything?",
            "I think it ´ s everything, yeah.",
            "So okay, if we don ´ t have anything, thanks for your time.",
            "Thank you very much too. Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Hello.",
            "So you are. PERSON7 you are trying to, recover from your past, missed sessions, by coming twice. That's good. Yeah. I was also hoping to see PERSON6, but yeah that's not the case. Never mind. So let's be quick and yeah. I would like primarily to ask PERSON16 and PERSON3, to debag, what was the problem yesterday. Because yesterday, the experience was simply disastrous again. And, So it didn't. It was, very badly recognised and it was also slow. So, PERSON16 would you have any, any explanation, for, the. Slowness? You're muted.",
            "Yeah, hi, sorry. So I mean, no, for slowness there is just one explanation. And that is, I need to be logged into, one, of, the machines.",
            "Yes, okay. So there was, yeah. And can it also affect the recognition quality or is it just slower?",
            "No. It is just slow.",
            "So, coul. Please get in touch as I wrote yesterday. Please get in touch with PERSON9, and, try to debug the, that again. I will download the recording from yesterday. So you can, probably replay that and, see what we can do about the, recognition quality. And, yes, then I would. PERSON3 has added some files, to the PROJECT12 Test set. These are also English, non native, and in the PROJECT16. So please evaluate that. And otherwise, what is your, progress with other things, evaluation and.",
            "So today I'm supposed to. So basically, we had a call with PERSON12 last night. And so I have to address this problem where the files were too big, so I could not get uploaded to PROJECT3.",
            "So I had to address that. So right now, I am looking into that. So how could I identify the files, which are too big to be uploaded to PROJECT3.",
            "Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, please do. Please commit everything that, that PERSON12 has created. Because it is bad that we do not have this version.",
            "Yes. So I 'll do for like one folder, and then they will do it for the rest.",
            "So I, I was doing it now, just before this call.",
            "And. This is, mainly for the preparation for the domain adaptation, right? Is that.",
            "Yes. For the. And I haven't heard back from PERSON4 on whether ORGANIZATION1 server is up again or not. Yes, I will probably talk to, to him again about this.",
            "Yeah, also please be in touch with PERSON4. For the extended set of target languages. So far, and it is set of target languages. And are you in touch with PERSON14 for, the text files for the dominetration.",
            "Yes, he is doing that. So, he has set up PROJECT4 by now.",
            "So, that is, I, don't think that is needed. So I think we primarily need PERSON14 to collect the text data. The domain specific data. And yes, doing something with PROJECT4 is useful in the long term, but it is better if people who already have that experience do it now.",
            "Yes. So, yeah, so he is trying to do that. I think he mentioned that. ORGANIZATION10, does not give direct access. So he has applied for it. So the data that ORGANIZATION10 has are just view, read only. I mean you can't download it or.",
            "Well.",
            "Also there are videos, so that even the transcript, you can't get it unless you apply for it. So first, we have to make an account to get to see the dataset. And then.",
            "So is, he is that the full PROJECT13 archive?",
            "I think so.",
            "So that is huge. So that is not the point. So what it should at least explain to him that there is a clear distinction between the PROJECT13 Archive, which are the interviews with the survivors of World War II of the Holocaust. And, some conferences about that. So it's like, the historical evidence, the recordings, and then the historical papers and. Presentations by historicians. And we are interested in the latter in the, in the historians talking about that. We are not so interested in the old people giving their memories as such. So this.",
            "Even their presentations, it was the case. So that is why I think he has applied for one.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he is waiting for the access. It is. It was the case in the ORGANIZATION10's archive. Yeah, so I thought so.",
            "So, in short, he should also scan the web pages of the people. Scan in breath, rather than in depth. So it is like breath for scan for the data so that he has whatever he can, even if he is still waiting for some resource. So please explain this to him.",
            "Yes, I'll do that.",
            "Okay, thank you. Great. And let us quickly move to, to others. I see also, PERSON3, is joining. That is, that is good. Maybe since I, we have now PERSON6 and PERSON2. Yeah, unfortunately, I'm still horribly struggling with the ORGANIZATION6, ORGANIZATION6 demo papers which are due tomorrow. And I really have to do it tomorrow during the day. Not too late, because, like, I will be busy the whole Saturday, and I have to go early to bed on Friday. So my time is very limited. And, I have now, started worrying about the calculations of a number of things. So PERSON6 and PERSON2, will you be here after the call. Can we continue after, we finished.",
            "This is just because I have dentist's appointment, in one hour. Okay, yes, but I read your comments there. I just wanted to assure you. I think for some of them, we are calculating exactly the way we should do if you see the code? You will see.",
            "So, the mind concern now was the alignment based thing. And whether it actually does the max, or, something, like that.",
            "Yes, exactly. If we have for example, we consider we should, it should be 200. But the alignment waits for it saves is for number for example 800. We considered it the marginal one. And we calculate character after that.",
            "Okay, so please, please have a look at the PROJECT2, the PROJECT2 environment in the PROJECT7 paper. And in the PROJECT2 environment I explained in two cases, German to English and English to German what is probably going to. What is probably happening according to the description in the paper and what should be happening. So that we actually give more time to the system. So please have a look at that. And like after we finish with the general call, if you're still available, if you do not have to rush for your dentist, then we can discuss this.",
            "Okay, okay, so that's. But. Or for example, I can answer the exact about the PROJECT2. I can send you an email when I come back.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "This is exactly the reason why I came to this call. Because I wanted to miss this meeting, but the reason I came just to say this. Because, because in fourty five minutes I have the appointment. I want to go. Anyway. Just I will see all of your things, and I will check the code, and we will answer everything in detail in one email to you.",
            "Yeah, okay. Well, if you have time in the afternoon for a call.",
            "Afternoon yes, yes.",
            "That would probably be faster, but anyway write the answers, down. Thanks. Okay. And, I would like to ask PERSON15, because he.",
            "PERSON13, sorry. PERSON2, PERSON2 is actually still, is still here so and he works.",
            "Okay, okay, that's good.",
            "Because I'm not here but.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thank you. So the other paper is the PROJECT12 demo paper. And I still, did not have any chance to reopen it. So PERSON15, I think you wrote most of the paper. Am I correct?",
            "No.",
            "No? Okay, so, so, who wrote that actually?",
            "I don't think so.",
            "So, could you. Could you perhaps, try revising the paper and looking at the reviews that we got? And try to, like a help with that one?",
            "I don't have an access to the reviews.",
            "Oh! That is strange?",
            "Is it in our leaf?",
            "Reviews ORGANIZATION8. Yes, it is.",
            "How is it called?",
            "Reviews dash ORGANIZATION8.",
            "I can't find it.",
            "You can 't find it? PROJECT12 multilingual life subtitling. I will email you the link. So probab. Is it possible that there is some different version? So the paper is supposed to be six, pages long. It lists everybody. Yeah, you are probably there. So there is reviews plain text file. They say that we have in a little impact, or they, they don't like it. That is horrible. Yeah. So if you could look at this, this would be extremely, extremely useful. Okay.",
            "Let's move on to. Yeah, experiments. Let us move on to, yeah, the, the idea that I have, discussed yesterday, but ORGANIZATION2 is not too keen on that. So the PROJECT14 quality is very bad for all, remotely handled sessions, and especially if people are wearing face masks. And the idea that I have is that we use again a brute force. And, we pass all our training data through PROJECT8 and other systems in an automated way so that we get the data distorted, in the same way as these platforms distort it, and also that we will use a frequency filter to cut down on the hate, on the like high frequencies. Which mimics what the face masks do. And then we would, either ourselves retrain that, or we would also like happily shift, send the data to ORGANIZATION2 and ask them to train their system, because their system is online and, fully integrated. So if you, would anyone have thethe time for that? That it will be some scripting of user interface in, in PROJECT15, and. Like it is not too bad if you, if you would run it in four PROJECT8 sessions in parallel. Then in a week, you would get like 600 hours. So it's without. There would be some extra overhead, for the restart or whatever, but it but it should work. So is anybody, curious about learning how to automate, x Windows and, and or perhaps windows that can be done also with Windows. Oh, okay. Well, then I'll have to look at it myself. Well, but please talk to me if you if you can. Okay?",
            "Sorry, I can try, but still I have to see.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON16, you should work on the evaluations first and fore. So for you, this is a lower priority I think. Because you. You should be like really focusing on getting it, getting the systems ready. So I've already talked to PERSON15. I hope that you can have a look at the paper. Sorry for this last, second notification again. And if, if you can briefly say what you have done so far.",
            "Which paper? This PROJECT12? The multi ORGANIZATION8 demo?",
            "ORGANIZATION8 demo yeah.",
            "Yes, I just opened it. And I need some time to read the reviews.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But I mean your other work, if you can, briefly say.",
            "I'm continuing with data preparation of ORGANIZATION5 corpus. And right now, I'm running the first alignments on the manually revised the Dev test. And then I want to rerun the alignments of source and targets of the interpreters and do some analysis on them. Repeat the old analysis I have on more accurate alignments.",
            "Yeah, us okay, so you. And, thanks for this update. This is the good. And do you have any update from PERSON5. And, oh, has he started to write the, the summary of.",
            "Oh, I do not have any update. And he wrote at he is busy with exams.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In January. So I suggest that, like you. If you have some long term processing of ORGANIZATION5 that is like where computation time is needed, then start it. But otherwise I suggest that you, move or give more priority to the write up of the experiment with PERSON5, because he will also be struggling. It would be like his first paper, anyway. So, if you could start, start with that. We would have better chance to, to finish it in time.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thanks PERSON7 for the suggestion, to just to use PROJECT10 audio codec. So perhaps you are in the best position to, to process the files. If you have any experience with that? Could you get in touch with PERSON8 and process all the files that PERSON8 has for, English, training data we need. We need Czech.",
            "Yeah, sure I, I can get in touch with him.",
            "Yeah, so we need Czech as well. But we need Czech only in February. Whereas we need English, in, like on the 25th like in 10 days. I do not know whether ORGANIZATION2 can fine tune. Any of their models. Like continue training. But if we process the data that we have for English, for them. They could give it a try. And the performance was so bad that we really need to like go into this and try to improve, that.",
            "Oh, oh, oh, all right.",
            "Yeah. Great, thanks. And to start a paper on the study. OK thanks. So then, PERSON7, since I've already asked you, please summarize for everybody. What is your status with the, with the, pipeline preparation, or pipeline configuration tool. Oh yeah, sure.",
            "So basically, when we create a pipeline for some event. It consists of a multiple parts, like some PROJECT14, some machine translation and, some online, subtitles. And for, for every event, we need to, make this pipeline in a different way. Sometimes we use one component, sometimes we us, another component. And, I'm writing a tool that, will allow an operator to define the, the part, of the pipeline and how they are connected. And the tool will make a script, that will make sure that everything is corrected as it was specified. And there should also be some support for a docker, and part of the pipeline that are, that are in docker. And, yeah, so that's that.",
            "Yeah. So let me let me also add to that. That the pipeline will be defined in terms of like abstract graph, in a way, and, then. It will be compiled to a batch launcher, or a docker launcher, or evaluation launcher. And the evaluation launcher that would run the pipeline through the PROJECT12 test set, with PROJECT7. That we would know, which of the parts of the pipeline are, performing badly in. Terms of translation quality. I just. It just occurred to me that there should be one more compilation target. And that would be like probing whether the components of the pipeline are up and running. Like a test of availability. So that's another thing that, that PERSON7, should on. If you could put this on, on the to do list or on the enhancement options, that would also be very useful. And another thing would be, like live debugging, of a of a pipeline such a speed of, of that. Okay. And, yes, and, so, and then the second item you have in your list PERSON7. Please comment on that.",
            "All, right. So, next Friday, like, next week somewhere there is going to be a conference about PROJECT13 and we are going to provide life subtitles and transcription. And because we will have some non native English speakers in there, so we will need to get some feedback, from the people that are using our subtitles. Preferab, refe, preferably life. So we can, see a moments like, where it was working and moments where it was not working. So, I will make some, quick took.",
            "PERSON15 already has such simple tool that you could adapt. What is more. What is missing is, description, of, like how to use the tool. And also more like a generic description of how people should look at the outputs. So, it would be best, if you could get in touch with PERSON18. Because I've asked PERSON18 to like handle the soft, soft things with the participants and also with the organisers. And, you and PERSON18 should prepare very simple instructions that the participants could follow. And it would be both for just giving them access to the subtitles and, separately. If the organisers say, that it is it is reasonable to ask such a thing, to get feedback from the, from the participants. You and PERSON18, you and PERSON18 if you could, could come up with the strategy, like the set of things that we want to offer and that we want to ask for. So it would be easiest if you get directly in touch with her. And if you two synchronised. Oh, okay. I will write. I will an email.",
            "Yeah. It's on the twenty fifth on January. So there is a week and a day. It's not much, but it's not starting immediately. Okay, thanks. And so. So, and PERSON15, if you could share with, PERSON7 your simple feedback clicking page.",
            "Okay.",
            "Which may be useful. Or it may be like. Given the quality is pretty bad, we don't want to like, ask the people, to tell us, it's bad, it's bad, it is bad, it's bad, like, it's. We, we need some, some more useful information. And if our outputs are so bad as they were yesterday, then there is actually no point in collecting the feedback at all. So hopefully we'll we'll have better working system on, on the twenty fifth. Yeah, okay. And, okay. So PERSON6, you found that maximisation. So just the description is wrong, right?",
            "Yes. Sorry. Just, I called my dentist and asked him, okay, I can come one hour later.",
            "Okay. Okay thanks.",
            "So I'm sitting in the chat. Everything, because when you finish, I want to describe what.",
            "Okay that is, good. Yeah. So, the, we have PERSON3 so PERSON3, please tell us what is your status.",
            "Sorry. Yeah. I don't know what's my status.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I sent, let's. You should focus on the like separate stand alone one shot of things.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So please do the, as I wrote in the email, do the files.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also, if PERSON11, and PERSON16 find out some PROJECT13 data in the public domain, please add them to the public part of PROJECT12 test set. I have already provided, PROJECT13, one PROJECT13 interview in the confidential part. So.",
            "Yeah, about that yeah.",
            "Yeah, this is also for PERSON16. PERSON16, please do evaluate the, the, systems, on everything. So that the next week same time, you can present the summary, of which, PROJECT14 systems and which PROJECT1 systems we have at hand. And what are their scores on the various domains.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you two, please make sure that we evaluate everything on everything, and we, can choose the best set up.",
            "And also has the presenter. The speaker of the last week's has manually transcribed?",
            "No. They haven't. I haven't sent them the transcripts yet, because, I shall have to rerun the transcript late. So that I have, like clean set of transcript. Because, if I remember, in the meeting. In the last seminar, the, pipe was, stuck at a point. So I have to do it, once again.",
            "Okay, and, I, I will also send you another PROJECT3 repository, which we have that, These presenters would be. Speakers generally use to erase. To make some PERSON17es in their editor and to the manual, or a revision of more conveniently.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON1 is the last person, mentioned in the, in the in the report. And he successfully developed a shortening PROJECT1, English to Czech. So there is something which makes the output 80 percent of the input length and the bleu score, yes, is lower, but just the shorter outflow the lower the bleu score. So by looking at the outputs, we are actually quite happy with the result. And this is also something that I really want PERSON16 to include, in the evaluations. So make it a new evaluation campaign, in the PROJECT12 test set evaluations. And put the multiple PROJECT1 systems, including the shortening PROJECT1 systems based on what PERSON1 provides, so that we can look at the outputs. I'm saying that it has to be committed to the PROJECT12 test set evaluations, because the bleu scores will be definitely lower. So we need to look at the output ourselves, right?",
            "Yes. So, to be evaluated in, new, PROJECT12 test set evaluations, campaign. The output needs to be manually, validated or, or evaluated bleus are bound to be lower. Okay, so I think that is probably everything right?",
            "Do you want to continue.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So, if anybody has anything else to say to all others. Oh, actually, PERSON8 you're here and you did not say anything. So what is your status.",
            "Yes, I'm I'm working on the chopped, training. I do not know if it is relevant for others. But, the idea is that, I, I align, training data that we have. For example, for English, and I 'now working on English and, I cut the recordings, to words. And then, using, external, other text resources. I create new recordings from, from the words from the separate words. So, there may be, two benefits for such thing. And there is that we can create more robust PROJECT14 that is that is not for refitting any. Speaker we can read, because we can. We can, for example, alter the distribution of speakers, or and, the second, important, gain that may be from this method is that the end to end PROJECT14 models, are creating implicit language models within. And because the are the corpora, the corpora, the speech corpora have limited, ss text then. And if we create, if we use another text like from. For, for example, some, some, some pure textual, corpora that we can, we can train on more, more texts or so. So the, so the, so the, implicit language model with which inside the PROJECT14 can be more robust.",
            "Yeah, okay. So, yeah, any new. How far, are you? You are. Generating?",
            "Well, I'm able to generate. The recordings. Now I'm struggling to optimize the pipeline, because, I, I've I tried to plug it in the standard training pipeline, but it was too slow. So, well. I need to somehow figure out how to how to, create it, quickly. And, and, the problem is with, the big corpora the be the big textural corpora like Czech. If I want to create a, like for the PROJECT11 speech, text, I'm doing there is so many such manner that. I, I just, create all the recordings for the all, all sentences in the corpus. And I create some deal direction, and I put all the recordings. And, I have, a job running on the cluster that is, constantly, rewriting, new versions of, of, each, text, and, it, is, it. The, the job is bit quicker than the training is so.",
            "So in this way we are sure that each recording is, seen by the, by the, neural network only once. But, the problem is with Czech, because, the PROJECT11 speech for example has a. Less than three hundred thousands texts. And, common with the, PERSON17 has like fifty or millions of recordings. So. For, for, because we do not have enough disk space and. And because we can't store fifty million recordings on the disc.",
            "So. But can you do it like in a rolling buffer on the disks so that you would actually be training over whatever, let's say.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah I.",
            "I thought so, I thought, so, but, I need to. The training pipeline on, that, private data stood loader within the PROJECT9, framework is a black box and it is quite complicated. So, I need to, somehow find how it works. And, so I either I have some, precise order, of, of, of, the elements. And then I then maybe. And then I can get it running properly in this way. Like in with the rolling, rolling window.",
            "Okay, yeah, great. Thanks.",
            "And maybe one thing on PERSON15. He has sent me an email with the PROJECT5. Some questions about PROJECT5. It was I guess how much I want to be played from the PROJECT5. Maybe this is question on you too PERSON13. And, we have, I guess, discussed this, earlier. But, I'm not sure I should be paid from PERSON19's PROJECT5 tool. So, maybe, or how, what's the split. What should be the split with this.",
            "Yeah. This also needs to be. I will do it half and half without any further information.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That's something that. Please talk to her, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah. So she is giving a talk, this afternoon, somewhere a remote one, but after that, she, she would be hopefully available for to say, what is the status with the PROJECT5. So please ask her directly.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "I would I would use the same number, the same amount from the two PROJECT5s.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so great. That's. So that's everything for the most of you. And now I would like to talk to, PERSON6 and of course PERSON2. About the, PROJECT7. Thanks everybody, and let us just see, each other again with, the latest, next, next Thursday. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, bye.",
            "Yeah, bye.",
            "Yeah PERSON13.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I've sent you an email. That's for your information. Because I've seen your concern, maybe I can describe and you can see the formula here. And yeah, I think even in the at the beginning, we decided first to calculate C without any alignment. Then, when calculated with alignment. We just put the maximum between without alignment and with alignment.",
            "Yes, but this is not the same as what I'm asking for. So I'll, I'll share my screen. And open the overleaf so it will take a while, sorry. What is distance? I do not know, that is something else.",
            "You want the previous word. Yes?",
            "None, not. Just let me let me open the overleaf when I? Oh, that is horrible. Yeah. I need to. So that's and then overleaf. So I hope you can see my screen now.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, so here is the PROJECT2 thing. PROJECT2. Yep, so what I'm illustrating is the, German and English, where the German verb is split into two parts. And the second part is the content bearing, and, would get very likely aligned to this, to the late part of the German verb would get aligned to the English word. So when translating from English into German. The problem I see there is, that, the alignment information between set and \"gezacht\" would bring the early time stamp of the \"said\" to the late part. So this is, the fí values, using, alignment.",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, alignment only. Given the, current max, and PROJECT11, there it would actually be okay. Due, because the, the proportional position of \"gezacht\" is at the end of the segment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so that is good. But that is not so. So your solution does not have the problem here, but I think it still has the problem here. And the problem here is when we were going from German into England to English. The German sentence will say \"Ich habe\" and then something very long here, and something vey long and \"gezacht\" So the \"gezacht\" appears as late as 1500. And then when getting the reference. So the reference translation, again, has the same alignment. \"Said\" goes to \"gezacht\". And by that, we do bring in the 1500, as the expected time for \"said\".",
            "Yes.",
            "That is good. So the verb itself is not expected any sooner than the source verb was uttered. Yeah.",
            "Exactly.",
            "But the problem I see there is with the subsequent words in the sentence. Who, which are more or less monotonically aligned to the to the English. So there from alignment they would receive time stamps like 800, 900 or 1000. And unfortunately, if the PROJECT1 system decides to obey the standard English grammar, it will cash these words. And it will wait with them only until it has guessed the verb, and then it would emit. All the words at once.",
            "Exactly.",
            "So I, what I said.",
            "So, so proportionately. I do not hear you well. Let me finish, and then hopefully the microphone will get better in the meantime. Proportionally, the alignment values and the proportional values will be comparable. So it would be like, maybe not, not eight hundred, but maybe. Well, it could be related the same values. So the proportion or alignment directly values will all require these words to be emitted, like it they would, it would expect these words to be emitted sooner than a previous word. So based on this linear ordering of the words in the reference. My proposal is to, maximize not only with the value from the proportional alignment as you are doing at the moment. But rather with the, with the value of the previous word.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "So that way. So this, this 1500, would max out all the rest of the sentence.",
            "Yes, yes. Was an impression, because at this. My mind was calculating everything in Persian in that time. For example, sometimes you can clean it. There were a lot of sentences in the beginning at the end. Maybe if the sentence is not very good, but it has a meaning. But in this case. If in German, yes, if, for example, you, you cannot say the rest before saying there verb. I agree with you. So we just need to, okay, just check the maximum? You know, increased. You know, progressive maximum. All numbers should be more than this. It is very easy. And I think it should be done. Yes, and I'm agreeing with you.",
            "I'm thinking, so I'll I'll write the paper as if we are doing this already. And you need to fix that. Yeah.",
            "Yes, it's simple.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'll I'll write this. That we are maxing out with the previous words.",
            "Yes.",
            "My question on PERSON2 and you is now, if we if you are able to, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the. That is, that is a lot of work. In the pictures, these pictures are okay, but, if we were able to illustrate this, This alignment, it, would be perhaps even better. So, I don't, know if you have, anywhere in your data, some such example. You have the alignment. Alignment files. So if you could search for a similar simple sentence, that, that, has, this, Alignment, that would be useful. So if PERSON2 could look at that. So that's one thing. And another thing is whether we want to max it also with the proportional value. And I'm not sure about this. I would suggest that we do not max it with the proportional value.",
            "Yeah, it's not correct.",
            "Because it's not correct. If we if we are doing the alignment based thing, then we should follow the alignment and this like maxing, of the linear order progress of the maximisation. That makes sense. But maxing it with the, with the, with the, like proportional alignment, doesn't make sense to me.",
            "There is another reason. Because for example, the only acceptable reason the translator didn't for example write this other word is waiting for this one.",
            "After that, it should both of them together, if shouldn't wait and then.",
            "Yes, yes exactly, yes.",
            "So I think. If, if, if it's a reason it should come up all in one line.",
            "Yes, exactly. So it should not lose anything in delay.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, the evaluation would be different if we were producing a spoken output. So there is a recent paper. Where by do people PERSON17e the speed of the text to speech. So that they can then recover. And they are emitting these words in some intelligible way. Not too fast and not too slow. So depending on how much input they have in the pipeline, they are PERSON17ing the speed. That is a different model, at the output. Okay, so this is clear. So, PERSON2, if you could look for examples like the one in the PROJECT2 case, that would be great. Otherwise just please do the PERSON17es of the labels. As I asked for. About the merger of the pictures. I would like delay that I think that has a lower, priority. And then I also had the questions for the -",
            "Yeah, so there I 'not sure if I actually wrote the questions down. So the segmentation strategies. So yeah, this is. I see this. PERSON10, please check. This is actually wrong.",
            "I will check this one and the other one.",
            "No they. This is actually wrong. Based on what's in, section on multiple refs below. So I will, I will fix that. So, I've already found the answer. I was I was wrong here. So the segmentation strategies are clear. But the. Yes, the delay calculation, the simple one. So, I'll PROJECT8 the picture here. And are the numbers still legible?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So I was kind of expecting. So, it's it's okay in the simply like calculation that O is located at 235, because, that is when O was emitted. I am happy to see that the \"t-shirt\" in German is located as at 400. Because that is what when this was emitted. That is, that is good. But I'm confused by the numbers in here. I've done the, the differences between each pair of, words, and the differences are not the same. So is it proportional? And if then to what?",
            "It isn't proportional. But I think last time when we made. We met in the seminar room again. We had this problem, and we put everything on the paper. The hand calculated, and I think those numbers, all of them was card. But if you want a can, again, do a calculation very clearly again, because I have not rechecked this. Yes, well, the difference are definitely not the same. So here you have a sick 58. If I'm doing the calculation right. Here you have a 43. Here you have 25.",
            "Because. The reason is. Okay, I think it was based on the number of characters. Something like that PERSON2.",
            "Yes, so please have a look at it. I think that the current description is like excessively detailed and actually confusing and not correct. What I would say is that. But check if it matches the code. That we, simply equidistantly split this time, into the words based on their length. And full stop.",
            "Maybe it is that, yes. I will I will double check it. Excuse me. I need to write. And here. Okay.",
            "And so then. Then the formula, there should be a formula. The formula should be like, what is the value for the word \"Ein\" or the eath word, in the table T. So how do we arrive at this three o four. And it should be just the proportion of the characters in \"Oh das ist\" And then I don't know whether you do include or do not include design \"ein\" in the total number of characters from. T-shirt as that is missing. So the there should be just a number of characters, and the time stamp of O and the time stamp of T-shirt. That should be the formula, um. and the formula. If you apply the formula to O itself, it should obviously arrive at two, three, five. And if you if you apply the same formula for T-shirt, it should obviously arrive at four, four, zero.",
            "All right. Because as I remember simpler calculations. It should be based on only C.",
            "Oh yes, yes.",
            "It is not on C. There is two, 0, four, and not two, three, five. So, this is what is also confusing to me.",
            "First time you see the 0, the first time you see this.",
            "I think this is like the end of the word.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Well, it depends what you are doing. I think it would actually make more sense to have. To really based it on C and have this, h, and put here at the end of the world. But the end of the world is like three characters proportionally from two, 0, four. And that it is probably something different than two, three, five.",
            "Yes.",
            "So let us make it simple. So if please check your formulas. I 'not sure if PERSON2 is following. Or you can explain that to him as well. So what i would suggest is, really base it on only C. So two, 0, four and four zero.",
            "And then the number of characters. And this should be the end times of the words. So the end time for t shirt is this four, four, zero. That is good, that here the formula should work. But here the formula should arrive at something different, not necessarily this two, three, five.",
            "Sure, but just give me. Okay, I will I will check this very carefully and will answer you in email if it is something else. But or if it is not, I will write all of this details, you said. And PERSON17ed the code to, I don't know. Answer back to the character. And only afterwards.",
            "Based on characters at the end time of, of the word. And based only on those time stamps in C. Just can I ask if, PERSON2, if you follow, I. Could you say. Could you just confirm it is based on characters?",
            "Hi everyone. No it is based on the words.",
            "Words? So why is it different. So how do you check it then? Because I forgot it.",
            "Fe, feel, feel free to switch to Persian for now if it's faster. Because time is.",
            "You can answer me in Persian, it is okay, PERSON2.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "It considers these partial words. And for example takes some estimation for the first word, second word, third word. Frourth, fifth and sixth word, so six words in English. But for, in our reference in German for example it is seven words. Somehow proportional, finds their for example destination. Or for example when we expect this word. Based on the place of this word. For example if it is seventh, for example if it is fifth word it calculated it. Something like that.",
            "Yeah, but it is so. Do we? Yeah, so I understand the motivation. The motivation is to use to make use of these partial numbers.",
            "Exactly. But the reason it is partial it is only to see them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The first time the word appears.",
            "Something like that. Sorry, sorry, the first time the word reaches in the C. For example if they are that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some words can be deleted afterwards.",
            "Exactly.",
            "I am thinking if this is simple enough to call it simple. So what you think if we, if we really PERSON17ed the simple calculation to. Something which is based only on the C segment and the number of characters. There will. Again that will bring another set of problems obviously. For numbers for example. Like if you have, 1986, then that would be four characters in the transcript, and then very long, time span. So that will, in your case, that would probably work better, like your solution would probably work better. So I 'll let us keep your solution as it is. So it is not based on characters at all.",
            "But just for information PERSON13. There is another type of calculation which is only based on the C, but we are. We didn't mention it on the paper.",
            "Okay, yeah, well, let's keep the paper as it is, Like, let's not add any further things. So, then if this is based also on the partial, segments. Then I 'confused that they. Oh, that is because it is proportional in the number of words. I see. So because \"das\" is perfectly aligned to this. But that's the alignment view, and \"das\" is not like perfectly aligned to, to this, if you look at it, proportionately. Because there are seven words in German and six in English.",
            "But, but is mainly for when we, for example, we do not have any alignment information.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll. I now understand. But the problem is that there is nothing in the paper that would allow people to calculate this. Well, there is the formula. But that is very complicated.",
            "Yes. But all of these calculations are in the formula, I think, because if you remember the formula. First ot finds the place, for example, is between the word of, for example, the first and the second word. It's between each of the four. Then based on that. For example, the time find the exact some estimation for when that word should appear. There is some in formula. Yes, you are right. It is not simple, but it is based on that formula. If you put on that formula, you can find this numbers.",
            "Okay, so I 'll try to decipher the foreground now with the explanation. So I think I know everything. Please have a look at the. If you can find an example with the reordering and definitely do PERSON17e the code towards the maximization. Like that.",
            "For this one, for sure today, we will finish it after this PERSON17e, because it is very easy. It is just one or two lines.",
            "Okay, okay, thank you. So that is probably it. I'll. I may email you in the afternoon if I still need some help, but I hope I do not actually need. The only like when you, if you find an example? That would be, better, there will be, one that would show the alignment,",
            "Just one more thing PERSON13. If you could repeat one comment just now in the. You said, you will, you will fix it yourself, or I will fix or I should fix it?",
            "Which one?",
            "The last one you put just few minutes ago.",
            "The PROJECT2's? No, no, I will fix it. I will fix that.",
            "Okay, okay. Thank you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The other one you asked me. Is the wording right? It was. I will double check it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "PERSON13, please could you add, add acc, my PROJECT3 account to the PROJECT12 test set and the? Yes, I will do it immediately. I'm surprised if you still do not have that access.",
            "That's a good news PERSON13. I think from the 5th of January they.",
            "The restrictions are over.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay. So where is that? Oh, I need to log in. That is why I do not see that. I hope it's this one. Okay, so settings. So this PROJECT12 test set. Manage access, invite. So please tell me, what was that. Zarivar or PERSON2?",
            "Yes, Zarivar. Zarivar, yes. Yes, 29 and 28. Yeah, I 'sharing the screen. So please check, right?",
            "Yes, it's correct.",
            "Write permission.",
            "And also, on. On, maybe on PROJECT6 also, so I can do that.",
            "I will do also PROJECT12 evaluation so you can see the outputs.",
            "Actually PERSON13. So we will finish this. And after all of this, I will send you an email, because I think I, maybe I might be not available in January to the first of February. For example, for PERSON2. And also, he is waiting for some feedback from other people for, this censorship or something like that in their pipeline.",

            "Hi.",
            "Just two of us?",
            "Yeah, I guess so. PERSON10 was about to join because he told me that he wants to be in the meeting. Because there are some decision points from his end. So, I had been in, in communication with him for two days. Like, there are already a chain of emails.",
            "Yes, yes, he is writing a lot of emails today. Also, I have also got around three or four.",
            "Oh, okay, okay.",
            "He was just was a way for the for Christmas holidays now. And, whatever else. And today.",
            "Yeah can you, can you drop PERSON10 your message over the phone that we are already online.",
            "Okay, okay, I can. He is here already.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'm writing you a mail. Hi.",
            "Yeah, hi. Okay. I was running little bit. Sorry I was caught in another call. Yeah.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hello.",
            "So, I'm I'm happy to see you. Both of you. Is, Are others also joining, or you don't know yet?",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. That's that's that's okay. So you are, you are the.",
            "For others you mean. Yeah. The others you mean.",
            "I guess PERSON13.",
            "On our regular calls, yeah, it is PERSON13. I don't think PERSON7 was joining us.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For quite a few times, so yeah.",
            "So what, what we have to discuss today? I, I, I reviewed the webpage. And I don't know if you have highlighted the portions of the document with the colourful papers.",
            "Oh, I.",
            "Never mind. I didn't have the free minute since then so don't worry.",
            "Okay.",
            "And, then I'm really worried about PERSON7 if he can actually help us or not. Because, I. Like, I think he might have started some PhD somewhere or whatever. So he may be actually much more busy then we would be hoping for. So it's possible that.",
            "Yes, he was about to move to Canada I think.",
            "Yeah. So, that, that will not make our lives easier, but well we have to work with this. That means that we will lose a pe, the person to prepare the data. So, I was curious how far did PERSON7 get. And that's probably something that PERSON4 should know, right?",
            "He sent me a list of named entities. I have partly did it myself and partly the annotator.",
            "And he didn't reply. And now after this Christmas holiday, during the holidays I didn't address him but now I see that he is not going to finish it because he stopped. Didn't respond.",
            "Stopped responding. Please.",
            "And probably. I will just probably finish it myself. And. But it's.",
            "But, but, but. Well, finish. You will finish the annotation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the annotator has stopped or PERSON7 has stopped. Who, who.",
            "Annotator has stopped.",
            "Annotator stopped, okay, yeah, so, so if you, see, if it is an online document. If you see that the annotator has stopped.",
            "He didn't do anything. He just didn't finish it. I've to him and it's an online document so I see that he didn't do it.",
            "Okay, so, that is good that you can finish it yourself, so, please do so. So, so, we can move, forward. And, then, get in touch with PERSON7 and double check that he would be able, to do the processing, also at the token level. So this annotation was done at the type level, like word types. And, we need to do the second round for many of the words, the annotators. You and the annotator should have indicated, that it depends on the context. And for these context dependent -",
            "I don't understand at all what you are talking about.",
            "Yeah, so this is something, that I wanted to also.",
            "Write it down. Somehow, somewhere. So, I will not be able to transfer all this information to PERSON7. I try to. So I have. It will get lost somewhere in the middle. I will open the agenda now and will send you the link so we can write it down.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "I think I should also take note of this.",
            "We can write it to the agenda if we can find it. It must be somewhere.",
            "We can actually put it to the to the master plan, for the. First shared task on automated minuting. Timeline, so we could put it into the shared task components, or we could put it to your agenda, whatever you like better.",
            "So this is the agenda.",
            "So, PERSON4 the ma. The agenda is in the master document so if you can check the Coffee Meetings.",
            "Okay so I've forwarded it now to.",
            "Okay.",
            "Virtual Coffee agenda. So am I in the correct one?",
            "And the last is this from the middle of December?",
            "Yes, yeah. So I 'here as well.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So five.",
            "0 eight. So I thought, I know that I have discussed this with PERSON7. And I 'not sure if we have written this anywhere or not. So this is like, get in touch with PERSON7. That is the short thing. But if he is not responding, then, like we have to.",
            "Is.",
            "Recreate it, ourselves. Yeah, yeah. De-identification, procedure. So there is a stages.",
            "I'll be back in thirty seconds.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll write the here. So collect, candidates for, Annotate at word type level. Candidates without context, if they are surely a named entity. Are, cannot be a named entity. And a NE, in context, our context. And dependant then, insert type level annotations into xml mark-up of the documents. Collect token level. Well, instances for annotation. Annotate at word token candidates in context of the sentence, or perhaps in, each occurrence. Or perhaps well. Exactly as the. This is in full documents if, that particular instance is an NE is not, an NE, and then insert token level annotations again into the same xml PROJECT3 documents. So. At this point. The documents will, contain information like, this word was once, was suspected to be an NE, but at the words type, annotation it was, marked, as a regular word. This word was suspected NE marked clearly as an NE in word type annotation. This word was suspected, an NE marked as unclear at type level. Not processed at token level yet, and then, marked as an E at token level, right? So this is not complete, but it illustrates that we want to have the, the finest possible detail about the annotation process. So we need to know exactly what has been touched by people with what result? I'm saying that this, the process, is documented to the finest level. I'm not saying that the distinct decisions are made to the finest level. That is a different thing. So we may be unsure about the particular instances being or not being entities. But we, we, we always must be sure about the fact, whether someone has processed this or not.",
            "Sure.",
            "So do you do you understand? PERSON4, you look puzzled so.",
            "Partly.",
            "Yeah. So, but, but PERSON9 have you read the process? And is, is that easy to follow?",
            "No, I think I need to see an example.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I'm really like.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, thanks PERSON4 for the link. To the, annotation maybe a rename that document, so it should not be a copy of. But it should say something like, annotation at the type level and so on.",
            "This is copy, because PERSON7 has made the annotations to the same file. And that he wanted to name it. So the idea was, well. But we can rename it.",
            "Okay, he doesn't want to rename it. If it is, if it is agreed, then.",
            "He, he asked me to make a copy of his document not to delete the lists so.",
            "That is, good.",
            "Accidentally not to move the information.",
            "But yeah, yeah, I, I just would like the name to be more descriptive for someone so it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like the word copy, is okay. Like it. But it has to, be this copy of that is, is, like, just an automatic what, what, happens, if you make a copy, okay.",
            "This is better now. Proper nouns.",
            "Proper nouns and personal copy of PERSON4 or whatever. That's. Like the word copy is good but this copy od is just automatic what, what that happens if you make a copy.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay, well, so the idea, is, at the end we need to have the full collection of all our documents with all named entities replaced by place holders. We agreed some time ago, that. You should find out the notes on this, that we will stick to the name tech hierarchy. Perhaps even a simplified one. So that we do not go into the details of types of the named entities. So the least possible detail. For some of the entities, like, names of months. We will plan to do them later because they are closed set. Very, very simple ones to, to do. But they should also be like documented. So the process of the named entity removal has to be very clean, and we have to know at what stage of this process we are. So this would be, the, the small, closed set. Things that they will be handled separately, and they are easy to do. The hard part are the entities which, like are normal names or project names or words, which can be names and may not be names at times. And we need this process to be like as fast as possible. So that's why I suggested to proceed at the two levels, first at the word type level, and then at the word token level. So that is the standard distinction from lexicographers work types and.",
            "Maybe I don't understand this entire world type level. What is the difference?",
            "Yeah. So a word type is the word as it appears in the dictionary. And word token is a particular instance of the word in a running text in the running text.",
            "So that is the first way. And now we are working on types, because I just see the words.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "And after that, we will once more do something with contexts.",
            "Yes, exactly. So we do want to have the annotation of the documents. So that we do want the token level annotation in the end. But some words like Jan or some clear names like it would be totally a waste of time to do them a token by token, so we can do these words all at once. So that is the word type annot, or word type level annotation. This is this the terms from lexicography. So that's, professor mentioned that the word type.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "And word token in one of the early seminars. So maybe you are too advanced, and then those basic seminars.",
            "That's. It is. It's okay. I just could not have tried. Well, I needed to connect it to work, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so I 'not sure if we will have PERSON7. And he was supposed to be the system operator. To do like the bulk processing of the documents and the insertion of the annotations into the Xml and things like that. So that is some programmer's skill that. If PERSON7 is not available, that will be like seriously in need off. So that's that's what worries me somewhat.",
            "Especially if PERSON7 will be away.",
            "Yes.",
            "It means that we are doing now is. Actually, I do not really need to finish the annotation, because this is some procession that's.",
            "No, no, no, no, no. Like, someone can pick it up from that point.",
            "Okay, well, I don't understand the code.",
            "So that is not a.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "That's not a problem like, you have, what you are doing is, is, the, manual, decisions, that's the value.",
            "Like then, creating such a list again, it is very easy. There could be some small mismatches when there is, like toke pancreatian marks. But, otherwise in vario. In most cases in ninety nine percent of cases these tokens, the particular things that you have in the list, they will appear in the list for everyone, whoever does it. So these distinsti. These decisions that you make then could be easily transferred an restored. So that ’ s good. So, this collection of candidates that was done by PERSON7. At the stage where the documents, were when he did it. And the annotation is still proceeding. And new documents are still coming, I guess.",
            "Well, it is really very. It has very bad quality, everything of that. First of all, there are a lot of typos.",
            "I'm getting into the list so ORGANIZATION11 once written with once written with N, once written with MN and so on. Once written with.",
            "Remember. Yeah, so this is, the typos in named entities are mainly because the people do, the annotators not knowing the correct spelling.",
            "Yes, yes. So I'm just saying that when I'm looking through the list there are a lot of different words, really. I don't know.",
            "Yeah, that's.",
            "Dozens and dozens.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then, also most of the output is not a named entity. Eighty percent is not a named entity.",
            "Yes, that's because there was, probably beginnings of sentences. So all of, the words at the beginning of sentences, also got into the list. This could have been, better if name tag was used. And I'm not sure. I think that PERSON7 did not use name tag because he needed to collect this list quicker.",
            "Yes.",
            "The, the, student, PERSON12. He used name tag so there is, quite a big chance that if PERSON12 creates this list, it would be shorter. It would not include, named entities that like. It would not suspect all beginnings of words to be named entities.",
            "Yes. And also the multi word ones.",
            "The multi word ones are also a problem.",
            "Yes. And they are connected. So, if you have World War II, you, you, you will have three words and, well.",
            "Yeah, so this. This I'll say stages and then. After that, un, or remaining or open problems. Open problems, and one of the open problems is the edition of new documents. Another big problem is, multiword NEs. These are even.",
            "And I don't think it inclu. The proble. I don't think that the program included all the words beginning from cPROJECT4tal. Because there are, there are really, not so many, not so many.",
            "I'm not really sure that he has included all the all this stuff in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, well, uf, uf, uf. Final checks - How do we ensure nothing, leaks, into the final data. How do we ensure no NE leaks into the final data. And. Open problems will also be this closed lists. Months, names, of days in the week. Yeah, and, what I want to say, as the last stage is, the actual deno. So replacement of a? Well, actually there need not be a replacement, but like the, like, the actual removal of the original text, from the documents. Leaving, just the Xml mark-up to indicate. Here was an NE of this type, right?",
            "And what is an unresolved problem as the identity of NEs, preservation and now well. Co-referencing, co. Co-referencing of chains, including, the identity of, the individual speakers. So we can for the for the summarization. I think it is important to know who said what. And when someone referred to someone else. We do want to hide the original name of the person. But we do want to ideally we do want to keep that this was like PERSON11 and PERSON4. And then PERSON11 addressed PERSON4, and so on.",
            "So we, probably do not need to. It would be better also to preserve the identity of project names or whatever.",
            "But I think it's. We really need to focus on persons. And we can, for the sake of time, ignore the identity or tracing of the identity of projects. For projects and other things we can say like: Here was a project name. Here was a project name. Here was a project name and don't make it explicit, whether it was the same project or a different project. So there will be a lot of gaps in this type of output, but I think it's for the sake of time. It's it's a thing that we can do. We can afford to ignore this. This type of chaining, but we should not afford it for the people. Okay. So, I'll, so. So. For the sake of time, we can probably afford to, drop, order to ignore tracing of these chains for projects. You see, but we should not ignore that for speakers and, for persons, referred to. So, I, the, to, to. For speakers. For speakers like, as, utterance labels, bu f and persons. I think that. Persons, Well, I do not. But we should not ignore it for speakers, in both, cases. When they, appear, as utterance labels and, when they are referred to in the text. When we.",
            "Maybe sometimes in can't be added. If the annotators already de-identified, they didn't know who is who so the labels can be A, B, C and so on. And within in the text it will never be the same C, it will be varied.",
            "Yeah, that's okay. There can be errors. This is, there could be data swaps. I don't think that the data set for the purposes of summarization will suffer much if we if we.",
            "Yes, I agree. Yes agreed.",
            "If we like mess up people.",
            "Yes agreed.",
            "We might afford tracing, other people who are only mentioned, in the, in the ext and, not, taking part in the meeting. So, what I 'saying by this is that if someone refers to PERSON11. PERSON11 is not a speaker in this meeting, and someone refers to PERSON11 at the top of the meeting, and someone else refers to PERSON11 at the end of the meetings.",
            "It will be the same being.",
            "We can afford to ignore, that tracing. We don't have to discuss whether this is the same PERSON11 or different PERSON11. We can say there was some person in the top. There was some person at the end. And that is the same, like checking if PERSON6. Is this PERSON6 or different PERSON6? So we do not have to do this type of annotation. We, we, I, I suggest that we ignore it. We do it only for the speakers, if we can.",
            "How do we know if this is the speaker or not.",
            "Well, if we don't, we don't never mind.",
            "Because actually, if the labels of.",
            "Yes, if the labels are A, B, C, that is what you said. Let's leave it like. Let's leave it non linked.",
            "That's, that's okay. So actually, our main worry is that some true named entity will leak into the data. Our lower or less important worry is whether we preserve the identities. And I'm happy to do errors in the second part, but I would be very unhappy to do errors in the first part.",
            "Yeah, so this is the outline. And we need to put this outline on a time frame.",
            "And person frame.",
            "And person frame, Yes, so get in touch with PERSON7 and check if this is what was discussed with him. And maybe it's it's in some document with him. I 'not sure. So please get in touch with him and extract from him the information if he can do this for us. And if not, then we have to do this ourselves. And in that case, that probably falls on PERSON9 for the programmer parts, I'm I'm afraid. So that means that you may need to offload some of your, the what modelling ideas or to PERSON13.",
            "We still have time. I'm not like so worried like I could I could de-identify this. If I had a week of. If I could lock myself in a sanctuary for a week, then I think I will have anonymised the corpus myself. Like it's it's not to. If you do, you do it with clever text editors and combining scripting and all that it's. Our data set is not too big.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's it's doable.",
            "Yeah, I think I think like I'm not, like certain minutings are still not clear to me. I will have a session with PERSON4 with the data. How like? What is the imput and what should look like? Once, I have that, then it would be easier for me.",
            "So what I'm thinking of is, for example, for the token level annotation. If I was doing it myself. If I locked myself for that week, it would be a few via macros, and I would be just hitting. F one, F two, F one, F two, F one, F two. And that would be the token of annotation. And it would be done for a document like very quickly. So, it is, I ', not so much worried. I think, it's doable. But it has to be a skilled person in this, like text processing. It's a special type of text processing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so that's the de-identification procedure. What is equally important is the de-identification guidelines. And potentially some new concerns will be added, like after PERSON4 discusses this with PERSON14. So, this is now my question on PERSON4. Whether you have already dates set on when to talk to or call or meet PERSON14. So please.",
            "Nothing.",
            "Plea, please do plan something.",
            "Well, PERSON14 is working on our de-identification from the beginning of January or?",
            "Yes. Yesterday actually. I told her yesterday that she should start. So she.",
            "And she has time and she -",
            "Well she will have to make the time for that. So she is till on number of projects and, and. But I really think that.",
            "So what should I. So what d you mean? She needs to do what? Yes.",
            "She needs to read the regulations. That will take her some time.",
            "About how to de-identificate it?",
            "About what is present data. So we do not know exactly. I do not know what exactly this person laid up.",
            "So she has to decide what should be actually anonymised.",
            "Yes, kind of. The way that I set it in the procedure that we discussed here that is based on my intuition. But I, I could.",
            "So she has to say, if we have to delete also the names of languages.",
            "For example.",
            "Well, so this is one of our basic questions. So this is actually very. I would be very happy if we leave it. If we don't anonymise it.",
            "Leave English, German, Czech and don't mix it up. Because it is at least some information that could be preserved in the minutes. So actually, if we have some, well.",
            "We can always do mock named entities. So, for example, for the languages, we can shuffle it. And we would say Romanian instead of French in all cases?",
            "Yes, okay, of course. But once one more thing. That we should align the transcript with the minutes.",
            "Yes, that has to be done this. The identification has to be done on both, of course.",
            "On the same way, so that we.",
            "Exactly the same way. So when I 'talking about a document. I mean, either the transcript or any version of the minutes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we. So you have multiple versions of minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "So a document is either the transcript or any minute version for that particular meeting.",
            "So document is any text, in the collection that is very important. I like, it seems natural to me. But we. We must not forget about this.",
            "So one question I have like. So this should be done especially on the PROJECT1 data, right? So we don't need to do this on ORGANIZATION6?",
            "No, not at all. So do you feel that not at all? ORGANIZATION6 doesn't go through this at all.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, back to PERSON14. I'm waiting for PERSON4 to finish.",
            "I'm just writing it to.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, back to, PERSON14. So, please get in touch with her as soon as possible. And, agree on a timeline with her. So she will definitely need some time on, reading for, for reading the. Regulations. The key word indeed is the personal data. She needs to tell us what exactly is persons data. And all person's data must be removed. Absolutely removed, the data set needs to be free of personal data.",
            "That. She is like. She will have various concerns. We need to like discuss with her, what is what is the strategy. So that, from that, discussions. From her survey of the regulations the guidelines will follow. The guidelines will be the result. And the guidelines will say something like person's name must not appear in that. And we will then check if the procedure that we are already running is in line with that or if anything else needs to be included in the procedure. So that the guidelines are satisfied.",
            "I think that these are not personal data. Things like months and languages.",
            "Yes, I agree that these are not personal, data. But she should check. Like kind of think about it.",
            "Yeah, so, so that's the guidelines. And, yeah. Please PERSON4 agree on a timeline, exactly. So I think that the, the annotation can go independently. And there will as last resort, there could be like a secondary or tertiary or final annotation stage. Where we would be still removing something which, like, we. Haven't thought of and PERSON14 has found it out.",
            "You mean the annotation of what?",
            "The. When I say annotation now I mean de-identification.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, so. And then, the other thing that PERSON4 needs to discuss with PERSON14, is the consent forms. So that we do it.",
            "So that is something totally different.",
            "That is something totallly different. It's very closely related but, explain.",
            "But this is what PERSON14 actually doesn't know at the moment.",
            "I sent an email to her this morning mentioning these two things. She kind of was expecting this. So, so we've discussed this before. So it is not that.",
            "Because I have also shown her many times this consent forms. This is totally new.",
            "And she will demand for kind of piece of that type too.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah. With this, we are in some time pressure. But not any worse time pressure than a month ago.",
            "So we have to decide how. What should be included, yes,",
            "What should be the wording of the consent form.",
            "And there are two types to, like, two stages of the content forms. This is new compared to the beginning of the project. Where we thought we would have only one consent form. Now we have two consent forms. The first one is, the one that we are using. Where people like, give us the permission to work with the data. And we need primarily now the second one. And the second one is we are getting the permission to publish the data in the de-identified form.",
            "So it means that we should kind of forget everything that we did before and do again from the ze, from zero. The first constant form created, which agrees with, kind of working with our data. And then, create a second consent form. About publishing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And give all the participants of all meetings, both consent forms of the same. Time at the same time.",
            "No, no, no. So actually we do not need to redo the first page.",
            "We do, because we have we have we have.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Kind of, our consent form. Our existing consent forms are about publishing actually, mostly.",
            "Yes, but they are not, but they are not perfect. And people didn't and they are.",
            "Of course, they are not perfect.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they are signed by thirty percent of participants.",
            "Yeah, that's that's the problem. So, people who have not really signed those. We are processing their data without having recived their consent. Hopefully they will give us their consent now. So yes.",
            "Mostly we proceed their data with their oral consent.",
            "Yes. That's good. So that's. So yeah. So we have at least that.",
            "And. So I would now, with PERSON14, I would focus on the second form which is the consent to publish the data. And this, consent, will be complimented with samples. So, ideally every person would have all the meetings that he was taking part in. He could browse them and check himself if he is still represented in that or not. It would be leady this de-identified. So he should not be able to, l, like feel identified. But he would know the content. So that's.",
            "So why not to forget about the first phase, in this case.",
            "Yes, so let's. Let's totally ag. Like forget about the first form for the purpose of the release of the corpus. And let's come to the first form only once the corpus is finished and released. And let'ss do this first form for the new meetings that we will still be collecting even after. That. So I. That I was my proposal as well. Let us really focus on the second form now. To have the permission to publish the data in the anonymous form. And later come to the first form again, because we will still be reaching out. And trying to get more people, provide us with meetings, and there and there we will need the first form. And the first one will be on the content to process the data and deidentify it with the forcing goal of publication. When people will be asked with the second form again.",
            "Well, I'm just thinking about this, samples.",
            "Yeah. If. So with kind of preli, openly said, if we really need all these samples for people we are sure about, like you and me, PERSON9 and so on. So, er, should.",
            "We can simplify it also by, like giving everybody the full dataset. Access to the full data set like brows this.",
            "Should probably be this in a consent form. So I'm kind of. I am a little bit lost in what should be done.",
            "So.",
            "So really should prepare the special examples for every consent for every participants. It appears to be the task for the whole year. And I -",
            "Well, no. It is a little bit of programming and a little bit of evidence, like, who was in meeting of what?",
            "Yes but neither me nor PERSON14 will never do that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah sure. Yeah, yeah. I understand, that there is, there could be, a substantial amount of administration so to say. Or data management. For this, which can be skipped. And the easiest way I see to skip is to prepare the data set fully de-identified already. As a simple directory with documents which people could browse.",
            "And give a link.",
            "And give a link. And people could open these. And then in the. You would like tell, sent everybody the consent form. So here is the consent for you. You need, to get your permission to, to publish the data. You have been a participant of a meeting of these days. Or something like that. So people could find themselves.",
            "If they want to check specifically themselves. And they would be also avail, allowed to browse any of that data.",
            "So we will do that, or not.",
            "So I think this is like a pre-release of the corpus. So as soon as we have the corpus, clean, removed the named entities. It is a matter of like a putting it in a directory, wrapping it in a Html, or, or, Any browsable format. So that is very simple. And I think PERSON9 would do that in, in two hours. So the preparation of the web page. That people can browse.",
            "Aha, so.",
            "What is what is the tedious part is, the, the linking which. Person was mentioned where. So this meta data that is.",
            "Yes, this is what I'm asking about.",
            "This should be, I hope that this is in your directory structure. Somewhere. That you like know who was participant of what meeting.",
            "Not about all of them. Definitely. I have just made a sample.",
            "Yeah.",
            "To make it manually it is a very big task. What I.",
            "Is it? Okay, can you?",
            "What I it can probably automatically extract is from is to extract the names. Of participants from meeting minutes.",
            "Yes that is.",
            "Created by annotators.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Yes and but sometimes this is.",
            "Incomplete.",
            "You have to incomplete and the names are incorrect. And you have to some others. And some people that the person, the annotator.",
            "Yeah, so that's. I think, the, the. Let's do the best effort thing. The best effort is to. Like, if you have an annotator who could review this. If you know that the meeting participants information could be improved, corrected by someone. One of your annotators. If you have like items which, where you specifically know that this is missing or something like that. Some manual effort could be invested there. But even if we don't do this, let's just collect it from the meeting minutes. The list of participants. And then we will say in the content, content, consent form based on. Oh, I forgot to record this meeting, is that a problem?",
            "No, you are recording it.",
            "It is already recording I guess.",
            "Is it? That's good. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "You would never forget it.",
            "Yeah. So even if we don't do this manual refinement of the participants. We have some information on that. And with the consent form sent to PERSON11 or PERSON8 we will say: \"Based on our records you were a participant of this and this meeting. Maybe you were also present to other meeting and you were accidentally not listed. So feel free to browse any meetings you like. \"",
            "So, this is.",
            "I think we can, What we can do is, like we create a master sheet. Then we extract the name of participants from each of the minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "And give that the, to all of them. Like.",
            "Yes.",
            "Please, please see, and check.",
            "Find yourself, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, so that's like a.",
            "That would be much easier.",
            "I think this is. Yeah, I don't think the stay, the extra step of cutting out the extra portion of the master sheet is too tedious. I think it's it's doable. It's it's kind of mail merge. So, a mail merge operation. So you like prepare personalised emails.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's it's not too bad. It's it is a little bit of work extra. I will leave it up to you what do you find, like the balance between your labour and their labour. What is polite and what, what is laborious. I 'll leave that up to you.",
            "Yeah, so once we have, once we have the meeting IDs and these are the partcipants so like, we can easily find to which ID belongs which participant. And then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That is. That should be easy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That should not take much time to do.",
            "And then, kind of separately of the consent form. We should ask people for bug reports. So this is, this is a big value. When we are sending the people again the links. And when we, know that people will be again opening these files, every gaze to that It's crowd. It's like, it's crowd sourcing essentially. Every gaze into the data set gives us an opportunity to spot other things that should. Have been anonymised. So they need to have a place where they would record, these, extra observations.",
            "Okay.",
            "And then we would do a second pass. If there. We will see, maybe there will be no more, outstanding pieces of information that need to be deleted, but maybe they will. And then we will do like a second pass of the data. And then remove these final things and release it.",
            "Yes, so I think what you are suggesting PERSON10 is like instead of the master sheet, we could. We keep one master sheet, but we keep well from the masters. It will. We create the individualized sheets.",
            "And they will have the remarks. Yeah.",
            "That is like a purpose. They will have remarks, they will have, they would have the remarks.",
            "Yes.",
            "Will have the remarks column with colour and based on that, we will refine it.",
            "Yes. So just please put this on a timeline. We should have a sample document, one meeting or two meetings at most. Ideally, at the end of January. So that we can put it online as to the prospective participants of the task at the beginning of February. This is something that I suggested in an email to PERSON9 this morning.",
            "Yes.",
            "And we need to have the full thing, was it end of March?",
            "16?",
            "Or 16 of March at the full dataset.",
            "A trial data is16 March but training data first April.",
            "Probably, yeah. So end of March. Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So please put this de-identification procedure and this check with the consents on the time scale. So I think that, end of February.",
            "I think we should.",
            "End of February would be a good date for the participants, for the meeting participants, to, to get their consents, right? Would that make sense. I think it's doable for us in those kind of two months to have almost finished the de-identification. And.",
            "March, April. Yes, I think I think two months would be great.",
            "Two months for us are good and then one month for them to answer. So they would. They should answer within a week. And we would have three weeks to finish it. And there is like, a little bit of time soul to handle any issues.",
            "So we write the data de-identification from the participants by February end.",
            "Sorry, say it again. In full words and full sentences.",
            "Yeah, so the data de-identification consent from their end should be done by, February end.",
            "No was the. We have to have the data ready for them to browse. So if we are able to have the data for them by mid February, then I would agree with you. I'm a little bit concerned about it. I think that we will have the data at the end of February, and they should then do the consent. In the first week of February, or something like that?",
            "Okay.",
            "Sorry. First week of March.",
            "March.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. And so talking about the timeline, what should be the time in line for this total task. Like for the de-identification.",
            "Yeah, well it depends on whether we have PERSON7 or not. That will also like affect the timing, I believe. But I think that PERSON4 will be finished with the work type level annotation, well, in. Two days.",
            "Yes, I have written that I will do till tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So it is. So.",
            "So it's it doesn't take. It's like thousand and a half maybe. It takes two hours or something.",
            "Yeah. So then we need the coding of the Xml. Which is item three, and then again, item six. Items three can be kind of delayed if inevitable. But it would be better to do it so that you can also you already use this. The Xml mark up to find, to extract the token level instances? So I think that the exact timing really depends here on who is doing that. And, the actual remover of the original, text from the document. So the six, six and seven. This should not happen later than in mid February.",
            "So I'll put it in here. This, should not happen later. Or this or this. This should happen, by the end of by the mid of February at the latest.",
            "Where do you write it?",
            "Just as a comment to that, to point six and seven.",
            "Aha, aha okay.",
            "So put it elsewhere.",
            "No, it's just in the agenda document I didn't see that. Okay, now.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so is that it? Or is there anything else we need to discuss.",
            "Well, there is a lot of things, I think. PERSON9 has created a lot of different things during Christmas holidays.",
            "The web page. I like the webpage.",
            "The only thing I'm not sure I don't like this changing very quickly.",
            "That's modern. PERSON4, you are too old. Ignore that. I also hate it.",
            "I wanted to read it and it disappears.",
            "Just like, close your eyes for that.",
            "Okay, so I will, I will increase the timer. So, don't worry.",
            "Yes, yes please.",
            "Probably, yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "And maybe one will thing, as you created the Scientific Committee. Why did you include all the Russians, all the Russians in the in here. So actually, I'm not sure should be in the Scientific Committee. You, they do not even know about that. They are probable participants.",
            "No, it is. It is just.",
            "This mock. Or is that through?",
            "So, it is not finalised. You know PERSON4.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So, it is not finalised, as I have just put the names. Because, like.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "If they are participating, so they could also be the potential reviewer. So they can review others work, right?",
            "That is right, yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "But we should probably ask them. So if you.",
            "Yes, yes. Definitely, definitely. So that is why I have forwarded you the email, right PERSON4. The email template that we would be sending to the.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, definitely.",
            "I did.",
            "If I. So I am kind of unsure of if we should invite all of these people to the Scientific Committee. Because more or half of them are master's students.",
            "I know I, I do not know. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, let's let's leave that open. But I. And I think master students should not be there really. It's it's at least PhD students.",
            "And I don't know who. And I, I don't know these people personally. So, I don't know who are master students. So this is kind of a special. Somebody is an autumn. Somebody is already like a kind of assistant professor.",
            "That's out of. That's clearly good. And PhD students.",
            "But they don't. So it is a very special task to look through these people. And somebody of them have some ORGANIZATION2, some ORGANIZATION2, ORGANIZATION9's or something. And some of them do have it, but don't have it online. So, it's.",
            "Well I would suggest PERSON9 that you put this list down and you would just put to be determined or in preparation. In the in the Scientific Committee. Keep it elsewhere and we will like discuss it separately. Do we have to have the list for the application?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. That's the problem. Otherwise we could have done it later. This is needed for the application.",
            "So then please prepare the text for an email to the prospective members of this.",
            "He already did.",
            "Where is that text.",
            "I have already done forward.",
            "Is it in the C, F, P.",
            "I guess I, I emailed you like, maybe in December. But I didn't get a reply.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, that is my fault. So maybe can we paste it. So there is this ORGANIZATION10 and ORGANIZATION2 2021. Does the document with the C, F, P. Could we use the same document for, editing the text of that, email?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so I'm forwarding it to you again. And you put a link there.",
            "Okay, yes, oh, sorry.",
            "And in the spreadsheet we keep track of whom it. Like who has it declined or accepted or in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for this work better, the more personal we write it, the better. So, the sheet where it is the ORGANIZATION9sheet. There is a second one right conf with the status. Okay, so please put all the candidates, from the web page to this list and, fill what you. Like do not spend too much time. The critical is the name and the email, and then obviously the status. But I would add one more column. I'm now in the, in this program Committee. Or let's let's let's call it Scientific Committee, right? Scientific Committee, so that we have the same language. I'm now on the ORGANIZATION9Sheet, that you will created. I don't see you the PERSON9 there? Are you there or not? Left. Oh well, contact, him her. So PERSON9 I have now added column F in the ORGANIZATION9sheet. And I suggest that we divide the people. So that we invite them personally, if possible.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the invitation email will be personalised in some way. So let's, let's in this ORGANIZATION9document, with the invitation email. Make several copies, individualized in various ways, and I will contact some, and you will contact some and PERSON4 will contact the Russian ones. Perhaps we will get even more. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's, we really have to do it, today, right? Because we need to.",
            "Yes.",
            "Need to, have this information in ten days?",
            "No, I would propose that we submit the proposal within the January seventh or eight.",
            "Oh.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Ouch.",
            "Yeah, yeah, you have to be more insistent on getting information from me. Like December is hard. But I should have not left this, unattended for two weeks.",
            "So the thing is, so the thing is like. PERSON10 we have to just submit the proposal because a scientific committee is not, will be fixed. So, like, like the people we know, they will quickly give us consent, right? Like from the PROJECT1 project itself. So.",
            "Well, there are people from a list. So let's. Can you put their names in the, in the ORGANIZATION9sheet. So that we can.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So, yeah, because I actually want to cancel some. For example, this PERSON5 and others. From ORGANIZATION3 I don't expect anyone to be in any good position for, serving on this. For example.",
            "Okay.",
            "So.",
            "So, so, PERSON10 can you just, tell me the names? I will then. Who do you want to see.",
            "Put them, or put all of them there, and I will delete the lines, or like cancel. Them like strike them out.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And you can also suggest some more people like you would you would want to write. So I will propose that at least if we can have fifteen people, fifteen people, that would be great. In a Scientific Committee.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I suggest that for the sake of time, let's finish the call now. And let us keep working on the on this request to participate. And on this list of people to contact. And, let's send them the emails today. And let's aim for the deadline that you suggested in two days from now. This, OK, yeah.",
            "I have one little question before finfish the call.",
            "This PERSON1, I have written to you. You answered for and transferred it to PERSON9. Just.",
            "Well. I didn't really transfer it to the PERSON9. I kind of like transferred the data questions to PERSON9.",
            "Yes. So actually.",
            "But not the modelling questions.",
            "Yeah, just the short questions. I'm just to ensure. Are you both willing to take part in the call as she answers.",
            "No, I haven't seen her answer.",
            "She didn't answer yet.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So, I expect that I would be in the call only. I don't expect PERSON9 to be there.",
            "Okay, okay. So yeah we will do it - Let's do it later when she replies. So let's not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, another thing PERSON10, just to I would be adding you to the PROJECT2 repo for this. So you can make changes to the HTML page if you want.",
            "Yeah, yes. Sounds good.",
            "And another thing. This can be done later but at the same time do you have any key note speaker in mind for this summarization? So that.",
            "Do we have to have one?",
            "Yeah, it would be great if we could have one.",
            "So, obviously we have to ask the old dinosaur well, not dinosaur, but the experienced people from the 2006, or what was that instance, the ORGANIZATION8 corpus? PERSON2, these people. I've I've clicked the link. I like the linked the reference to the previous ORGANIZATION10 event. The this word re, rejuvenate. That is also a perfect match. I like that in our text. So I think we should try those people as the key note speakers. Because they will. They will like give us the best background knowledge from the past.",
