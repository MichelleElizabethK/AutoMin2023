            "So, I'm glad is. That there is an appointment on visa embassy, right.",
            "Getting the visa. So I'm gathering all the documents right now. It's australian horrible. Because of covid the officers are like semi open and. It's it's hard to me.",
            "Yeah, yeah, understand it.",
            "I think PERSON10 is joined.",
            "Yes, I see PERSON10 here. Hi.",
            "Yeah, I just have to leave the office so that I'm not disturbing. And when I'm out of office I have to wear the face masks. So, what I have the microphone that the face mask so it worked.",
            "Maybe, maybe PERSON5 is alone in his office. You could join him, no?",
            "Yeah, or whatever it's okay, it works. So mm-hmm. So what are the topics, today, because PERSON5.",
            "No, maybe please, please open the agenda. It's, should I send you a link, PERSON10?",
            "I'll try.",
            "I will send you. I will send you a link. Here in this.",
            "Yeah, yeah. It works, great. Thank you. And yeah, except that it opened the small stupid web browser. Yeah, okay, great. Yeah, so, you have ORGANIZATION1, great, yeah. So have you had a chance to look at the ORGANIZATION1 sessions yourself?",
            "Yes, a little bit.",
            "Because we tried one. We also need for other purposes to test the subtitling.",
            "So it's all situations where some debate, which is not like preread, prewritten documents, is, is held. So each of the speakers will only like have those sizable blob of information, often, these blobs of information, refer to many details like reports, numbers in those reports as like a providing evidence for the claim, and then the claim comes. And that's probably it. So, I find it, like I agree that it s a good data, because it is free available. But at the same time I find the data very different from what we have. In other settings. So, it's it's okay to have that, as a contrast if data sets in the shared task. But it's like we, not so interesting data set. I think that more importantly, we should definitely have the, have ORGANIZATION2 and PROJECT1 data in there.",
            "Well, the problem is ORGANIZATION2 is also that it is very different from the point of view off summaries. Because thought real meetings in our understanding of meetings, but they have one paragraph abstracts of coherent texts. So, this is also different. So the meeting.",
            "So the ORGANIZATION2 and PROJECT1 right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. So that's that's that's like halfway the problem. If at least the meeting runs as we expected it, to round, then we can do our own minuting. That would be different from the ORGANIZATION2 minuting. In minutes would be different. But still, it would be more similar to what we are normally collecting. So it would be like a contrast, if summary a non-standard, an alternative summary of the, for the ORGANIZATION2 meeting.",
            "So you, you prefer not using ORGANIZATION1 talk.",
            "I'm not sure, it's difficult. So I did. So, what I really would find difficult would be to use ORGANIZATION1 and invest our money for creating summaries from ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because, that's that's something which I can not really imagine. I think the summaries would that be good.",
            "This is yeah, yeah, yes, this was actually the question. We looked last time on Friday or when I don't know, on Thursday. We looked at ORGANIZATION1, together, with PERSON5 and PERSON6. And PERSON5 and PERSON6 liked the transcripts that to this word that name. And then we, then I found the minutes to that and like the minutes. So the minutes were really boring. So there were just names. And I don't know PERSON5, PERSON5 and PERSON6 and PERSON4 bla. And some other people reported point, saying kind of, kind of an interesting. They were a structured in way we kind of expected a little bit. Some kind of bullet points which reffered to some parts of the transcript. So I looked at of some videos. And I also had the same impression as you did know. As you said now, and even more of their to their presentation. We are in different languages that for also kind of complication, this is then normal speech and normal dialogues, but they are translated so.",
            "They have, they are interpreted life.",
            "Yes.",
            "And it's not the language itself is not a problem. The transcripts are very good, I'm sure. But the summaries.",
            "Useless. So the question is how much data we need for the share task. So this was also the PERSON6 wanted to prepare for today. Because we have kind of a little bit more. So it's something around 100 hours. Some of them ought. Some of them are twice. So it also depends on more meetings. And 55 hours for check almost all of them double.",
            "Yeah, these are, these are dub, but these are upper bounds. So that we need to be very careful about the contents, we really.",
            "Yes, yes, I know that these are upper bounds, yes.",
            "And this can we had to go to a half. But even if it is half. If we have like 50 hours in total, that will be great. So I think that's for a sensible test set. So we have to admit to the participants that this data set is small for the full training. It is acceptable for some form of fine tuning, or, the like the development set. But I can easily imagine that all the whole data so that we will have a 50 percent will serve as the test set and 30 percent will serve as the development set and only 20 percent will be for the file unique kind of. So we actually should give the week will retain half of the data of the test set, and will give away half of the data for whatever purpose of the participants would like to use it. And they will probably split it in some cross-validation, and do some little bit of file tuning and evaluation on this heldout data set, and then we will evaluate on this half. So for the division into train and, test set, testing can be very non standard. It can be almost the majority of data used for the final testing, that can easily be the case.",
            "Yes.",
            "But I don't think that this is a problem.",
            "This is what we already told two weeks ago.",
            "Yep.",
            "And now PERSON6 came and said that it's really seems to be very, very few, and he had, and he made a summary of what is used for share tasks. So he can -",
            "Summarization OK. So PERSON3, PERSON6 could you please present this because I don't know I know the standards in machine translation and speech translation kind of. In speech translation you, or, or, or speech recognition 2 hours are what you want. Or you are obviously evaluating every single word. So there is a lot of points that go through this evaluation.",
            "So PERSON10, I, yeah, so, I must say that I went to almost thing to share tasks. But none of them was on some speed summarization. So there were speech corpora and it valid or not. So for some for some it was 19000 hours.",
            "19000?",
            "So it was it was. 19000 hours. It is really thing where the impacts on speed signals, and the date signals in PROJECT1 uses the. And some even we found that there were some share task that were only 80 hours of data. So it really depends on the task. So I found was 80 hours.",
            "And the 1 8 like 1 8, right?",
            "8 0 8 0.",
            "8 0 80 hours.",
            "8 0 80 hours.",
            "This is point summarization. So how many sessions.",
            "No none of them were for summarization. And as I say that there were no speed summarization share task for a long time. It was back in 2006, and no information was there. About, that summarization task.",
            "Okay.",
            "So Yeah, for speed summarization. But I need a I need a general share task. So it really depends on the task.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So there is no gold standard that. Okay. So you have to have the standards, there's a lot of data.",
            "Yeah. That's good for us.",
            "So I think that we will simply use what we have. And it, it depends how much of the data survives the contents. But if only half survives, which will give us 50 hours of English and 30 hours for Czech then dividing this half and half, So that we would have 25 hours of evaluation for English. And 15 hours of evaluation for Czech. I find that great. Like it's a 50, 50 hours. It's 15 meetings of the like if your score would be just one word scroll like a good or bad. Then you have the quality, final quality scale, precise to the to tens of percents. So like a imagine, and that the were only giving like 1 or 0. And you have 15 meetings. That means that on your full scale, you divide the 100 percent into 15, steps. That's obviously insufficient, but we are not going to score was this like binary scoring. So we will get enough, variance on the on the scale. So 15 meetings are already like representive enough for me, I would say. Obviously, that there are very problematic the representative if this were problematic, because it's only one or two teams who are contributing. And get aloneness. Is like a big limitation. But, if you take this into a count. Then 15 as the number of, evaluated items. And each of the items is evaluated on very fine grained scale. I think that's, that's interpretable.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we deciding to use ORGANIZATION1. Guys, do you hear me?",
            "Well, if ORGANIZATION1 comes for free. If it is only matter of downloading some of the data and polishing it a little, no manual processing of that. Yes, let's include that. Let's include one separate track for ORGANIZATION1. Because that is the domain that people who do speech, or like a good at. And there is a lot of data around, that people can gather. So we only need to, well, this is kind of them. So, do we have to say. They would have to use ORGANIZATION1 data from fix year and say that we see, you must not be used in the training, for example, something like that.",
            "And, so I can I can say what we can do if we agreed to use it. We can take the corpus from 2006 to 2011. And kind of transcripts and add minutes that can be found. So it's not a big work and should. One should not read the transcript that just to find it in the database, and two were true and the text. So it is so and it. It does not need some work because, and for each meeting, we should find the minutes. But you should not read the transcript. Yeah, copy paste. So for one meeting I l don't know it will take something about 5 to 10 minutes.",
            "Of manual work.",
            "Cannot, you have to do this in alignment between the session and the minutes manually? Or is there any way to automated?",
            "Because minutes are on their website. They just search, we should search the minutes using the name of the transcript.",
            "Yeah. This surely can be automated. So that, it will not be 15 minutes, but, you will manually prep like a automaticlly prepare web page on our ORGANIZATION5 lab. And that web page will be a list of links to these minutes. And the annotator will now only like twice click like here is the transcript. Here is the minutes that we've automatically found and you, and you open that open that and click yes to validate it. An open meadow.",
            "Minutes are on just on web.",
            "Everything is on the web. I do not understand the ORGANIZATION1. Maybe if you share the screen and show me about the minutes live. I can tell you if this is if this automation seems possible.",
            "Just a moment I'll share find something.",
            "So the only thing is PERSON10 that minutes we have, or ORGANIZATION1, I. And as PERSON3 said it is mostly about the people names. Like think different people they grip to these. So if I were a participate. I can only simply a bachelor would to give a doctor's yet. Yeah. Yeah, there is no more.",
            "That's why I don't want to invest much work into this. But it's, it is a nice contrast if data set again. So it illustrates the fact that for some minutes, just listing who mange, who like contributed discussion is sufficient. And, then.",
            "Again. And again, it is what way to prevent that our because we have spontaneous speech.",
            "And this is completely read.",
            "Yeah, alright.",
            "Oh, shortly to show you the screen. You, so rare. You, what we have. Aha, you can't see the whole screen. Can you see the as well?",
            "Yes, I can see your screen sharing.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we have. Sorry. ORGANIZATION1. You take some meeting that PERSON5 exerupted. I don't know. This one.",
            "So they do not know what. I'm seeing the web, the web browser.",
            "Aha, so not sharing. How to do that. Just a moment.",
            "This show like the whole screen.",
            "Now you see it.",
            "Yes, I see.",
            "So set a transcript and the name of the chapter.",
            "Approval of minutes of previous sitting, okay.",
            "You know that it worse probably 6th, October of 2011.",
            "Mm-hmm,",
            "Your research for 2011. October from 11. Yes I'm looking in minutes. Sorry. So somehow to find them here.",
            "And then here to click on it. And find something like that. Here find this chapter, and is that name that you found in the transcript. And the results in minutes look like that.",
            "What can you show me as a negotiation, proceeding in accordance. So it is a summary of the session.",
            "Yes. And this is one of our transcript. So we have a transcript include and I don't know. 1000 words. And for this session, and these are minutes for the session.",
            "So is it a summary of one person talking?",
            "No, no, no, it's for the whole kind of meeting.",
            "Yeah. And because the sessions that are so far. He was always like people talking for 3 minutes, maybe there were also by them.",
            "No, no, no.",
            "So they are like they have one minute so contributions right in the discussion.",
            "Yes. This is discussion say maybe have an all long 20 minutes left.",
            "Okay, and a summary is just this.",
            "And this is the summary of that.",
            "This is deffinitely very different from what we have. And, if you get all the name identities right then probably you.",
            "Nothing remains.",
            "Coworkly. And nothing remains yes. So. I think it does make sense to have this as a contrast of task. But it is a very different and we should say so.",
            "Yeah, it is very different. It is very different. The question is if. The question is if to do that, that increase the data, of course, not.",
            "Yes.",
            "Together as our data. But when we want today, because we want to decide if we do that or not.",
            "Yeah. So if we were voting I support it. I support it as a secondary track.",
            "So that and on their financial point of view. It means that I asked one of my annotators to do this alignment.",
            "Yeah, it's. There must be way to make it simpler than all the pre filling of this search form that search form. That's that takes too much time. What maybe. Yeah.",
            "I think that more time will take making it the formally in a good form that we can. PERSON5 should prepare how it should look like this sample of this send reporting to the.",
            "If you look at UAL. It has some ID. ITM.",
            "Yeah, should be search.",
            "So can we, can we just use these IDs? This sessions have.",
            "And this is a small IDs. ID 0 4. This is. No. These IDs of the ORGANIZATION1 corpus not of parliament. So, these IDs cannot be used to search for minutes. Because this is.",
            "And what you mentioned to the title of the session? Where do I see that title.",
            "Here is a title, and.",
            "But that's not. Well. That's just the approval of 3 years, that's not.",
            "A approval of sentence? That's really kind of.",
            "The minutes indeed is it the. So is it the correct one?",
            "No, no I didn't find the correct year. So. You show you another one. It just will take more time for me to search and speak at this. I will try to search and I find I will show you. To stop showing a in a.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So one thing I want to mention. I also found the in the ORGANIZATION1 corpus. That if you want include that, I'm absolutely okay with that. But the thing is. But in some minutes some minutes were like some kind of hyperlinks that leaving to some other things. So we need to late like, maybe assured that guidelines who avoid those kind of, those kind of minutes, and those kind of.",
            "And the hyperlinks other to like number things regulations? Or are there also other links?",
            "Yes, yes. No, there were mostly from the ORGANIZATION1 side, but do it like hyperlinks to other things. And those were looks like minute. So I would to take and show you an exactly hyper, but I would find it and.",
            "So I called couple of like this kind of. And so why the framing the guidelines import this minutes that you should the avoid those kind of minutes.",
            "So the way I see it now is that we should have a like one shared task assignment or well, maybe you have the A and B or. And 3 underlying data sets as the 3 test sets without much training data provided to the participants. The first test set would be our corpus. Second test set would be this ORGANIZATION1 just downloaded aligned meetings and transcripts. And the third, would be ORGANIZATION2 and PROJECT1. Again, the standard test sets of this, right? So you would have.",
            "So ORGANIZATION2 and PROJECT1 would be your test sets? Are you.",
            "Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, I'm saying that yeah. So I think we should have 3 tracks. We should have our track, ORGANIZATION1 track and PROJECT1 and ORGANIZATION2 track. Because that way we are comparable with the literature. That's the ORGANIZATION2, PROJECT1. We are doing what we are interested in. That's our train set. Our test set, sorry. And then, we are also, like extending the coverage for the ORGANIZATION1 sessions. Because that is the data set that for example speech people are familiar with.",
            "So you mean, these only causing the test, in the frame it is it is just our data and the ORGANIZATION3 project alright?",
            "Oh, well, what we can provide that we should provide. So for ORGANIZATION2, PROJECT1 we can easily also provide the existing training data as the training data. For us, we will have a very small portion as the training data. And for ORGANIZATION1 I don't think that the annotator who would be doing this alignment, could cover substantial number of these meetings. I think it would be to small subset of what is our directly. So if we have someone, if we ask PERSON1 to download and automatically align, the transcripts and the minutes. Then yes, the we should probe, provide also the parliamentary sessions, the training data. But otherwise we can say that there is no training data that they have to like download that from the web themselves. And, we also have to deffinitely, four beats them of the years. So all the sessions that we put into the test set should be from one particular year. So that we can say, and this year is excluded, right? Does it make sense? Do you agree PERSON3?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, we should look at the transcripts automatically. It would be better to download it all and align it fully automatically and provided as the training data. That would be nice with, and also be useful for us, because there is some summarization going on. It is different. But there is some summarization going on.",
            "So one thing PERSON10 I want to ask. Can we download that data and will make, like then as the test set training to the participants, Or we just say that here are the links you need to download and then test? Because, I'm not s.",
            "It's much better to repackage it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because it's a than it standardize this the way to propose and see it. So it's much better repackage it.",
            "So we don't run into any copy.",
            "Well, the idea is that no one refuse there is no money they could get from you. If you are poor, no one the file anything against you. So that's the.",
            "Okay.",
            "You really have to make money to like attractive for that.",
            "Yeah, right.",
            "Oh, may I show you one example?",
            "Mm-hmm, Yeah. Please do that. I'm sharing the screen again.",
            "So I just, I have found how to find to I just forgot that last time. Yeah, we have some chapter ID some document from the ORGANIZATION1 corpus with the name of the chapter. And this of the chapter is searchable for the minutes. I have just found it by the name. And this is these are the minutes for this chapter. On this very.",
            "I do not understand is hooked up the name of progress on mine action is unambiguous.",
            "Oh. And even more. So two of them will found. So I was looked in the by that, by the title I just put line here. And the program found, actually two outputs, but both on the same days. So one of them was some voting. And this is not the document I show you. And this is the run.",
            "So the actually we are search for the title was in exact. The title the ORGANIZATION1 corpus, we should also use bracket.",
            "Yes, yes,",
            "But, he has. So this is this is okay. There was only one session in that period found in those five years, that is surprising, but yeah. But what about the minutes? Because the previous example, that have shown the title was like voting on the previous session minutes. And this happens every week.",
            "Well, as I looked full, as I look full the corpus there was the chapters are quite long. So. I think people didn't think about repeating and not repeating. So they probably may repeat. But normally they do not because they're quite long.",
            "I don't understand it.",
            "Yeah, well, when you just look, and you don't look for search for something and just look for some day. You find.",
            "Okay. So you flipped it to the day. Have you limited it to a day or not?",
            "Not, no, just to the years, to 4 years.",
            "And do we know from your parl date of the session?",
            "Probably I don't know. Now I don't I don't know.",
            "Maybe you were searching for something. So does it work, if you are not searching for any words?",
            "Normally, yes, last time it works.",
            "Mm-hmm,",
            "The first picture but than.",
            "Well, so for example here. Uh-huh. So they have September June, aha. You choose minutes. And these are the title. So there are these country. Each opened this of this seeking, order of business.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "I can try open enough this on their own business. I have. There are a lot of.",
            "Yeah, and they are from different days. So by the day, you can be able to match it.",
            "Mm-hmm. And it seems to me quite.",
            "The most open. But is there to date? Yes, Monday Strasbourg. So you can search for the date, based on the date, and the title.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "This surely can be done automatically.",
            "Probably, I can't.",
            "So we should find someone who will do it automatically because it doesn't make much sense to do to manually.",
            "Well. It depends how much we should get from, how much meetings. How many how many of them.",
            "So I don't see PERSON1 on the call. Is he take part regularly?",
            "You mean PERSON1.",
            "PERSON1, sorry, yeah.",
            "PERSON1 wrote me today and he was planning to call me tomorrow. To discuss something, and he is working on a fix now on consense.",
            "Um-hum, okay. Yeah, so he could be the person who could do the downloading in, because he would be probably. Or talk to PERSON8. PERSON8 is on vacation this week. But try sending him an e-mail. I think he simply use some Wget scripting. I remember that he got booked of several times, and he used a led machine. So this is exactly an exercise for the CS student in early years of their masters. So to create a downloader of from and something which reconstruct the structure based on matching of strings. So this is this is really easy to do. So no one, no one feels confident in that, right?",
            "No, okay. Maybe. So, I think we should first decide if we do that, and if in case, we do that, how much of the meetings we should get out of that. Beca.",
            "We should. If we do it we should do all and provide it as the training data, because it if doing so if doing this all, it allows us to clearly separate what is the training avoid the evaluation data set.",
            "Oh, you mean all ORGANIZATION1? All, okay. Because they are also very different in size and a participants. So PERSON5 clustered as I know and hear and meet structured them. According and according to that. And they have there meeting includes more participants. So it includes one participants. It's not the meeting. And if it is very short it is it's kind of different task. And if it's very long, it's also kind of different task. And some of them are comparable to all corpora. So, PERSON6 propose to divide it into 3 parts like short meetings and long meetings. So should we really take all of them like data and participants made choose divide them themselves. It's also possible.",
            "So, I would release it as, so actually. PERSON5, PERSON5 are you on the call?",
            "Yes, I'm here.",
            "So, PERSON5, the way you obtained this open acces or the open academic corpus. You downloaded something big, right? And you only process it and filter it in some way. Or did you also do some downloading of individual pages yourself?",
            "No, it was already there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they are just big, I just.",
            "What we what we need to do would be to redo what has been done by those. Okay. Yes, OK requiring, Okay, that's good. So. PERSON5, are you back?",
            "Yes. So we, what we should if we are include ORGANIZATION1 in the share task. Then we really should prepare it for the participants to make it easy. And the data set is, it will involve some work indeed, but it should be really done by a CS person by annotators to match the transcripts and the summaries and the minutes. And, it is exactly the word that has been done by the open academic corpora. By the producer of you, and then you do that, and then compile that in the OHDS the various corporate, but you're right. So the question is wheter you PERSON5, which would be able to do this first step. Something which we have not done for the OHDS but the which was needed here, or if we need to search for someone else to the first step.",
            "What mean of the first step? What do you mean?",
            "Finding and downloading the pairs of transcript and the minutes for all the sessions that are there.",
            "But we already saw a minutes they are not variable. They are not good, they are not variable for us. The minutes are there in the web.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "But we already agreed that they are not usable right. You just participants these that on that. And the discussion about this, they are not variable. They are not real summaries.",
            "They are some form of minutes. So this is the. So I thought that you were one of the people like proponents. One of the people who prefers to have other data sets in the share task. Sure I am, absolutely I am.",
            "Yeah,",
            "But there is not diversity of data.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "And I really like the transcripts of ORGANIZATION1 corpus.",
            "Um-hum, yeah.",
            "Very nice. So if the kind of select the best transcripts in terms of lenght and other some other area. Would just needs the minutes, right?",
            "Yeah, but I have.",
            "But minutes that are on the web but are not useful, so.",
            "But I don't find it any better.",
            "My proposal is to have some people create this. Summary this work or some of them or the best transcript that we find. And then we agregate the subset to the existing data and reach the diversity and we have more data and more diverse data. This is my idea.",
            "Yeah. So my big worry is that the existing minutes, which we agree are not very good are still the best ones possible for the sessions. I think that the content is simply boring that no one will come up with better minutes. That is my worry.",
            "Maybe. So, so, and because of this here, yeah, because of this worry I don't want to invest annotation money into this. So I'm I'm happy to invest like programmers money to get the big collection. But I don't think that we should spend annotation money on this.",
            "And this. And our another topic is that we have looked at more. And I'm speaking for PERSON5 now. And we have looked at more minutes PERSON5 have enough long before. And we that may actually not so bad as that. Or as those ones we saw on. Than the direction and then not so extremely bad. They kind of summarize, and then and then and discussion, and they are as summarize, and maybe as well in another way, but not in a bad way. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Problem we decided to take the whole ORGANIZATION1 corpus and to pack with existing minutes, invest money in alignment and kind of programming an end in that direction and published it as a separate.",
            "Yes, perfect. This is exactly.",
            "So this is what we decided up to now for last 40 minutes.",
            "And you did this with PERSON5 right?",
            "No, with you.",
            "With me, yes, Yeah, exactly. Now. I know it because you said you were speaking for PERSON5.",
            "No I'm just transfer into PERSON5.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were speak for the benefit for PERSON5, not like.",
            "Yes, no, yes, for the benefit for PERSON5.",
            "So. I think that as PERSON5 has this several releases of the open academic summarization corpora. We should have another, summarization corpus. Let will be the ORGANIZATION1 sessions summaries corpus, and that will be the transcript and the, and the minutes to that. And it is somewhat different from our domain. But it is on very large set of topics that I think that is the this corpus alone would be very usable resource.",
            "Very usable?",
            "Yeah.",
            "For what? For what?",
            "For summarization.",
            "For summarization, wow.",
            "There are some. That is different summarization. It is it is similarly different as the like the title, and the, and the abstract. This is also like a very specific kind of summarization, does not summarize the paper. And the paper content is it is summarized by the up three, but also in a very special way. So I think it's very different types of summarization. And this is deffinitely one of those.",
            "Maybe, I don't know.",
            "Yeah. PERSON3, are you in LOCATION1?",
            "Yeah, no, not yet.",
            "Because you are freezing. Yeah, you.You should put some wood to the to the heating so other.A I didn't, I didn't have time to make the heating, yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Okay. So, so to summarize. PERSON6, do you agree that will have 3 different tracks? Like data tracks?",
            "Yeah.",
            "In the share task, and we will have a different assignments. One of the assignment would be is do the summarization, but maybe have already figured out what other assignments would be there like tasks, which would be a as simplifications of this. And all task should run probably across all the data sets. Unless we find the reason that something is not possible, something does make sense. And that we should do one more corpus preparation. That would be the ORGANIZATION1 minutes corpus. And that will be the pairs of transcripts and minutes. And all of this we will take a small portion as the test set for our shared task. Right?",
            "Yes, yes. I'm absolutely fine with this, because, more data means you get the importance.",
            "Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes, And we should invite people to like cross train. Cross train for in all these across all these tasks. So any pre-training on the CNN, daily mail for the purposes of ORGANIZATION2 and pre-training on ORGANIZATION1 for the purposes of our corpus and everything is welcome.",
            "So we explicitly say then that augmentation of audition because of the participants.",
            "So the way and WMT would WMT is that we had, like constraints single language submissions. That in our case would be submissions limited to the training data that we provide for the given a like a track. Then there was multilingual submissions, but still constrained. And that meant you can use any training data from other domains, for the particular track. And then we had unconfident submissions and these unconfident submissions they could use any other data you found. And anything simply. So, we are, we have now added 2 more domains to the task. And that ads the condition like train cross the main. So it's cross domain, but constrained. And that's a valid category of submissions. Right? Does that make sense?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, I'm happy to sign again yet, or?",
            "May I ask what should I do with the data now in that respect?",
            "So we need to find the person who is familiar with Wget, and who can download and prepare the corpus. That's the critical thing. Otherwise ORGANIZATION1 is excluded. So we need to find the person. So, who is enough in that. It could be PERSON5.",
            "I can try. I can try.",
            "PERSON6, OK, great. So please talk to PERSON8 as well, because, he has like as I said he is on vacation this week. But that is still at home probably. So ask him a for a session where he could walk you through the way he download the, the speech part of that. So he was downloading the speech part. It is quite different, obviously, because you are interested in the transcripts and the summaries. So maybe you can do on your own. But in case you, you needed any suggestions on how to like get through these what form so where, then he will probably know. I also know, I have never done this many times in the past. It will take a. But, it would take a does.",
            "It is just scripting that. It is just scripting that.",
            "Yes, exactly, as a scripting, that web and downloading it in a way that automaticaly alignes it for you, so that you can use the, if you if you escape spaces and others, the dangers characters in the in the titles. You can actually use the name of the, you could use the dates, like the year, slash, month slash day slash title of the session. And maybe with a point, one point, two of their multiple copies, and you can use this as the as the director structure, and you can put the files there. And you will immediately get the alignment. Soon as you find the same thing. On the same day, with the same name, you got a pair.",
            "Well, but, at the moment, we still don't have the uniformal format of our data neither. Actually maybe we should first create kind of template, how the file output should look like? Would do that.",
            "No. Well, well, what, template for what? Template for the layout the directories or the files?",
            "The output. So actually the hard data look like. Because PERSON5 proposed that basic sample. And then when we looked at that, we realized that we do not have any structure and there for example.",
            "And, so, it should probably look kind of similar our basic symbols and ORGANIZATION1 data set.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Transcript begin somewhere transcript ends and summary begin summary ends so.",
            "As the file, so that there are some of your mind that.",
            "Yes. Of course, of course. But what should be inside? So.",
            "And inside in the transcript like. I would not spent to much time on this. As you just do. It is in some reasonable way and for the minutes. We will just convert the bullets to the non standard thing that we have as standard. So it will be probably dash space and dash space and dash space.",
            "Yes, but should be for example at the end of this should be appointed the end of the challenge. Should, is it not important should I just forget it.",
            "What? Sorry.",
            "A point.",
            "A fullstop.",
            "A full stop and a future.",
            "No, no, no, no, forget about this. This is already like, the style. This is something that we, the session already, the people in that area we find.",
            "OK. So. I can forget about it.",
            "Yes, I, think you should simply. Yes. The our formalization ends with the fact that we are aligned oriented with dashes in the minutes.",
            "Yeah, OK. I just little.",
            "PERSON10.",
            "Give as output the data will mess you, but okay.",
            "But the one thing. PERSON3, have you seen the PROJECT3 presentation by PERSON7 or what is his name. The colleague. The remote colleague of ORGANIZATION5 who is developing PROJECT3. No? That was on in Hnanice.",
            "I haven't been in Hnanice.",
            "Yeah, the remote one.",
            "Even on the remote one.",
            "So can you? As it is the open the weekly, ORGANIZATION5 weakly.",
            "Yeah, I'll find it. Or something.",
            "ORGANIZATION5 weekly.",
            "So PERSON10 I just want to I want to report then. So one for the current downloading of ORGANIZATION1 data. We will be mostly faciliting on having the ASR and the corresponding minute, right? In one format.",
            "The transcript.",
            "Yeah, the transcript and the minute in one format.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Exactly, and as many folders as you can have, and obviously the. Yeah. I'm searching. And PROJECT3, pdf, yes, PERSON7. So here I'll share the link of just pasted through the session, where is that chat? Here is the chat. To PERSON3, I want to, oh, I can chat only to the host. So I'm only sending it to you PERSON3.",
            "It's okay, aha.",
            "Or some reason, I don't know why.",
            "Some reason. I cannot get. And the host so I get it. Thank you. The talk I'm referring to is actually, this one. PROJECT3, and the link is the link, copy link, location. So this is colleague. This PERSON7, who works, remotely for ORGANIZATION5. And he is developing a web brow, like browser for big corpora. He has been on the Czech parliament browser, and he definitely has a great experience with XML for preserving the original data. And he would. But it's it's like if you ask him he will probably come up with an overkill solution. He is too experience to that. We need something simpler. So he has already gone through decade of corpus annotation. And he now knows how to preserve everything essentially, but we don't need that at the point at the moment. So, but feel free to contact him. PERSON2 has like a supervisor, or the closest colleague. So talk to PERSON2 as well on this. If you feel afraid of losing to much detail. But I think it's it's very simple. We should stick to the XML format that we already have. And we can, and we have also consense our own data, the speaker diarization. That is one link there where we should learn from PERSON7. And we should also learn from ORGANIZATION1 data. Our corpora do not have a good speaker diarization details, do they? What's in the transcript? Do we have people's names, A, B, C in the transcripts? Or maybe we have?",
            "Yes. We always have in manual transcripts we always have the name of the speakers in brackets, but they are different.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sometimes they are like OTHER like PERSON10. Sometimes they.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Sometimes T as. And if there just, if the person didn't know he just A, B.",
            "Okay. That's that's perfect. So this information should be only converted to angle brackets instead of square brackets. And the same angle brackets style should be used for this, for the ORGANIZATION1 sessions. Yes, quite a lot of information actually. So who. Somebody would forwarded because this is what I actually know and I'm afraid of doing not clear and so well, just, I'm afraid to make mess in that actually.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "The format is not a zero question, as I understand now.",
            "Say it again.",
            "Format is not a zero and it is a question that should be kind of explicit.",
            "Yes, it is, it is something that should be done. I have a very clear idea of what should be done. And I find that very simple. But I agree, it is not like fully automatic like.",
            "Well, it's really in your head.I don't have I don't have any idea.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "And I think also that PERSON5 understanding of it and yours understanding of it are also different, because one for example to begin the transcript and end the transcript. And PERSON5 didn't propose that. So we probably should make some document.",
            "No, no, no we should someone sensible should prepare the data. And that's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But full.",
            "The question is how much work will the consense before PERSON1. How much time will PERSON1 have and when will PERSON1 have time for any such of the job. Because I think that PERSON1 could be the person.",
            "Because I think that PERSON1 has a lot of work with.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Because begin he has uploaded fast, but only in English for the moment. And it seems to be larger problem for him to work with Czech data. We wanted even to work Czech data. But it is a pity to avoid that, because it's better data than English. So he will join us tomorrow and we can ask him.",
            "Ehmm-hm. Yeah. So is that seems reasonable than maybe PERSON1 another option is that PERSON6 downloads the data. And then me and PERSON6 will start the processing the conversion, and then PERSON6 would finish that. That's like the fallback solution.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So you mean ORGANIZATION1 corpus yeah?",
            "I mean ORGANIZATION1 corpus, yes. So in any case, if you could start downloading everything? And putting it somewhere. And the directory structure that I proposed. So year slash month slash day slash the name of the session. And then you would have something like dot. That transcript dot. Whatever the transcript is it. Is it in HTML, or is it in other format? PERSON3, can you share again the screen or the transcript are?",
            "So what.",
            "Sorry, the transcript are ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "Yeah, yes.",
            "So at this work I would first try to do use to find an automatic script. To get the, to get the transcript and also to get the minutes. Maybe even, maybe have talk to the extra file. So first I want to create file further and once we have that I read about the years.",
            "Yes, so tested on very small number of sessions. And test it with just txt output but then we probably move to something which preserves more of the details. Yeah.",
            "So the key thing is that you will get the pair of HTML, or actually, this is not HTML. This is this is already txt but it's an extra mile from the ORGANIZATION1. So you can the has this the. Unfortunately, this doesn't lend itself to easy renaming. But it has the speakers. I is. So the best way would be to start from ORGANIZATION1. And reorganise ORGANIZATION1. Reusing the files that PERSON3 is browsing now. Reorganize them to the structure that I've proposed. So year month day slash the name of the session. And, so you would only like copy the files there. And then you would do that you would populate this there to structure with HTML of the minutes that you can download. Right.",
            "So one thing I would like, yeah, yeah. So one thing I would like to ask it also, this thing was, it was like manually downloaded, right? From the ORGANIZATION1 paper. That was just shame.",
            "Not manual. No, we already have it. PERSON5 downloaded to the server. But he made different folders contain indifference size of meetings. We can ask PERSON5 again to put the whole corpus to the server. If we decided to make the whole corpus, not to structure it. So if you want to take everything. And then we hear you just have one big folder. We have it on the server.",
            "Yeah. So you should only reorganize that into the directory structure according to the dates and names of the sessions. So that you can easily complemented with the minutes.",
            "We have it, PERSON6?",
            "PERSON6, yeah. You already see.",
            "It's here. We have it here. ORGANIZATION1 folder and PROJECT2 minuting folder. So, and.",
            "So this is actually. And what is this numbers. This is the size?",
            "This is the size. This cluster by PERSON5.",
            "And the source file?",
            "The source is E N. E N is double source. English.",
            "And that is, the full think.",
            "Yes, the full thing.",
            "Yeah. I'm just working whether this ORGANIZATION1 corpus should be in PROJECT2 minuting or whether should be moved one, one directory deeper. And it was the third party corpora. You have to go. Yeah. So I need to have. So I need to do a print out, and the signature for PERSON9. So, yeah. So these are all the different sessions. It is a flat structure. So this is for PERSON6, this is already the bases. So PERSON6 please processes this, organize it, according to the dates and the names of the sessions. And then complement it with the, with the minutes. And, then will to discuss what in what way do we need to like rename it or whatever. And actually it would be already a ready for the release.",
            "Yeah, so I think I think now we need to really organize. Now scripting is not prepared, right?",
            "Say it again.",
            "So, I think the measurable of data are downloaded, right?",
            "The ORGANIZATION1 is. But, so the transcripts. But nothing from the, from the minutes.",
            "Minutes, yeah, okay.",
            "So, is there anything else we need to discuss or?",
            "Probably, well, now we decided that PERSON6 will work with the data. I will continue annotate my our data with my annotators. And, then, after we have prepared it from ORGANIZATION4 ask somebody to correct it or some. But let's that later, not at the moment. So probably we decided, as I mentioned, the sure of, okay. I think we did what we did.",
            "Yeah, okay, that's great. Ok. So thanks. I think, it's everything for today. And if you need me in another call then let me know in advance. And, okay, so thanks a lot and I'm I'm. Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "PERSON3, are you there?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So as forwarded and getting this share your screen of the ORGANIZATION1 data once?",
            "Once more okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay. So. Yeah, can you go back to the name folder?",
            "It takes a lot of time because they are very, many files then.",
            "This folder contents all the ORGANIZATION1 transcripts, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "And the next job is to have the corresponding minutes for each of those transcript.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay. So PERSON5, hallo.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, PERSON5 can you, can you share that how did you download this sticker data from the from the ORGANIZATION1 web. Or is it, I'll be leaving somewhere.",
            "Sure. It's when you the should download link there. I have a link man. There is a text file.",
            "Yes, the link agenda. I can show you.",
            "It's there in the cluster. I have. It's already in the cluster, yeah. It's also the cluster, the same folder.",
            "I don't have it. Anyway, just.",
            "Can you point me the link. Where is it? In the doctorate?",
            "I have sent you also there and I have sent you the link. You could download everything.",
            "So in the chat?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. So, it is from the from the from the MT.",
            "The first the first is our sources. But they are a kind of very slowly downloaded. Probably.",
            "There is limit in the downscale. Yeah, you can download.",
            "So this is MT dot.",
            "What?",
            "It is it is stacked MT dot, right? It is that website.",
            "Yes. It's that thing, yes, yes.",
            "Okay, so it was for the machine translation. It was for the machine translation work.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, but this is a source. Patient version is align is process is rather process.",
            "But this is the one that we released as part of the parl corpora for machine translation, right?",
            "Yes. So this is the source. The merchant machine translation the parl is align. Is. Or we should translation. This is the source so that can be used for other purposes as well like to process it.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I got it, okay. Just me, the minutes for each of those ASR.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, but it was still 2011. I guess we have enough.",
            "This is 2006 till 2011, I think. You can read the description of the corpus. Somewhere. There is it pdf of pdf.",
            "Is, yeah, 96, but okay.",
            "Maybe, okay.",
            "Okay, one more. So, let me do checks today and tomorrow and.",
            "Thank you. So. Are we satisfied?",
            "Yeah. I think. I think do we on major decisions. With PERSON10. I think for today, it's okay.",
            "Okay. And let's finish probably. I'm really cold. It's about five degrees here.",
            "Okay, okay. So you are in LOCATION2?",
            "No, I'm in the forest, I'm in the forest. Kind of nature.",
            "Oh, wow.",
            "We have a with, which can be heated, but it's not heated now. So, it's just really cold here.",
            "Okay, okay, okay, okay. So yeah, we will see tomorrow.",
            "Okay. And PERSON1 will join us tomorrow.",
            "Okay. This is okay.",
            "See you. Thank you. Bye.",

            "Oh ok. And do you know who is this?",
            "No, I don't. Maybe it's PERSON3 I think.",
            "I would not expect PERSON3 at this session. Because. Yeah it is possible but we should not waste her time. So PERSON10 before others join the plan B. Does it work, does it were you able to your system is frozen again.",
            "No it doesn't work for me so I tried to create some fake time stamps and try to emit this like kind of instruction message so my it didn't work for me. So.",
            "So the easiest way is to replay. Do you know that PERSON6 has these scripts to replay a lockfile.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Are you using that?",
            "No I.",
            "So this is what I would do. I would create the file with time stamps and use PERSON6's replay scripts to feed it to AB client and to the presentation workers.",
            "Aha. So what I'm afraid this time the first so like we have much depl language tabs like we have English, we have Czech.",
            "Yeah. So it should be fed to all of them.",
            "In the same language or like?",
            "Yes, English or in all. In all it should appear like get ready and click on the click instruction 3 2 1 click. And that should appear in all the languages. So that way it is the highest chance that people will see these subtitles.",
            "Aha, ok.",
            "Yeah so it should it should it should not be that difficult. Yeah, so PERSON5 hi. Thanks for joining.",
            "Hi, hi.",
            "I have no idea.",
            "We'll see. And we're still waiting for PERSON9 and PERSON1. So this Zoom account is shared with like it's across the whole ORGANIZATION1 of from our building.",
            "Ok.",
            "And occasionally it happens that like people join and that's why the PINs are used. There was a PIN right? Wasn't there?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or wasn't there any?",
            "I don't think so.",
            "We just click the link I think.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, so maybe the link included that PIN.",
            "Yeah I was I was ready to type PIN but I wasn't actually prompted for.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON14 I have a question. So today at the same time we are also having the ORGANIZATION4 promoting so what do you want to do with that?",
            "Let's hope that they are recording it by themselves. I totally forgot. And I don't know whether they wanted the subtitling or not.",
            "So I just e-mailed you and I think it's better to e-mail PERSON14 that I will.",
            "Yes, please e-mail PERSON14 and yeah, and we'll see.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hi, hi.",
            "Hi.",

            "I think that's PERSON4. The first path of the Zoom US link we are using.",
            "Yeah, it's it's.",
            "The first we user. Well don't worry.",
            "Yeah, but does it? The first path of the Zoom path? ORGANIZATION3? No ORGANIZATION3 is the ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Ok, maybe it's the.",
            "Ok, so let's let's get started. So and we have PERSON11 as well, great. So I'm I'm getting very anxious about the demo actually. Because we had these mini sessions. And I knew how that system was like. I knew it reliability and the quality of translation. And that was everything like. I was happy to fight for that the quality is something which is hard to gain and all that. But we are now struggling with the set up. That's that's my main worry. So we need something very simple. So that we will not share a screen, because we cannot like broadcast. We need something that will work remotely for the project officer and also for other guests he will invite. So each of those has to independently start watching the same thing at the same time. And the simultaneous time is the is the problem. That.",
            "Ok. I ‚ I PERSON1 told me the result of yesterday test. Okay. He's working he worked on the plan A. I have also a plan C which is the one I'm focusing at the moment. My idea the following and let me know if sounds reasonable for you. The idea is you usually bypass the Mtray M3U8 URL putting the frame in the ORGANIZATION5 server which expose also the SSL certificate. So actually on the ORGANIZATION5 server we are able to expose an HTTPS URL, ok. Then upload the video file we would like to demo on the ORGANIZATION5 server. And then on the server run FFM peg command which actually streams the video file.",
            "I don't know how to do that. I haven't. So I'm I'm serving like regular files and I don't know how to how to stream. I haven't.",
            "Ok, I will have some idea. Let me finish. Prepare the FFM peg command which streams the video file and both provides the inputs to an AB client on the server. Which starts the transcription. Actually I haven't yet finished to prepare this kind of pipe but I'm already able to swim an MP4 video file.",
            "Ok.",
            "I don't know if you have time to now I can demo -",
            "So can you paste the link where we can watch your streaming?",
            "Actually I'm publishing on my local host so reachable. But it actually it takes an inputs path. A local path. If they actually were FFM pegs rights expands and expose the directory. It works. But at the moment I'm not able to publish on a public server because of. I'm just trying to fixing the pipe.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But at this point we can let the video be playable both from a common web browser, VLC, because also VLC take input network streams. And also presentation platform because actually presentation platforms. The video box takes in input a public M3U8 URL. And I suppose that we are able so to stream and simultaneously provide inputs to AB client.",
            "Yes so this last bit is something which we well we have not really done that. But it should be just a T command hopefully. Normally what we do is that we set the sound input to follow the sound output. And run a record on this like loopback sound device. And this is how the AB client gets the gets the sound. But the T command should also work. So this is this is this looks very promising if you're able to do the streaming. On public server. And then if you're able to do this then I think. Yeah, so this is the best solution. And then the machine which would be streaming this. We could even as a fallback solution if like if we are not able to create the public frontend URL. Then we could set up an account for you so that there would be a net cut solution, like a horrible one. But you could start the streaming and.",
            "Anyone with the access to the ORGANIZATION5 exposed server could run this pipe because you just need the FFM peg installed, video file if you would like.",
            "Actually I. Yeah I'm really curious about the set up that you do on your localhost. Because.",
            "Do you have time now to discuss it? I can explain.",
            "No I think PERSON10 should discuss it primarily.",
            "Ok.",
            "But there is also firewall issues. So PERSON10 should try it yeah. We have to see what the what on what is port 80 really, yes? Is it HTP accessed?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So then. I'm not sure if we are allowed to. This is something that would need cooperation from our admins. Very likely.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That they would.",
            "Because we need to be able to well. Who will run the FFM peg streams?",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "Local to the web server. Because you need to stream both video, audio, AB clients. So actually it needs to be run the in the web server. But those are technical aspects I know it sounds critical. But I think the most critical part is to identify the video file and to start performing test of.",
            "Yes.",
            "And machine translation on cascade because you know. We will be able to justify in some way lags, not very fast streaming because of course we are all remote. But probably the project officer will focus on the quality of the provided translation.",
            "That's right, yeah, and not on technical issues. This is like necessary condition but it doesn't help in the assessment. Yeah, I agree, yeah.",
            "So maybe while we, me, PERSON1 and PERSON10 we focus on the technical set up. Please I ask all the other I see there is also PERSON5 and PERSON11. Please try to identify the good video file suitable for this kind of demo.",
            "Yeah, I put some suggestions for German TED talks in TED.",
            "Ok, nice.",
            "Yeah, so it's I haven't seen those possible ideas TED talks. Yeah, playlist of German TEDx talks. This is by you, right?",
            "Yes. I tested those with our current best set up. Which we will deploy for the ORGANIZATION6 mediator also for the demo. The German segmentation is not as good as the English one. But it was ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I tested I tested a couple of ones but the one, specifically the link but I link one specifically was I think possible to follow.",
            "This one might be good so I can have a look. Yes, I agree with you that these Youtube subtitles are excellent. Including the translations not just the transcriptions. And I've I'm quite sure that they are generated offline. So they appear before the text is spoken. Actually, they are even they could be even manual. There is PERSON8.",
            "Yes. This one has both, this one has both human gen. Human transcription and automatic transcription. You can you can switch on the video.",
            "Yeah. This is a TEDx talk? It's actually remote. Interesting. Yeah ok. So the channels that we have or the videos that we have recommended was this ORGANIZATION2. And for that the translation model may work better. So we're not only we're not only transcribing but we also need to translate. And vocabulary would be probably better fit for the auditing domain. Because PERSON5 has created the models for that domain.",
            "So 2 thoughts about that video. I watched the video, the German one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "First, it the project officer maybe considers it too easy. Because it's very stage recording the person speaks much more clearly than the TEDx speaker. And the other is, it may actually not be that easy because this person is speaking Austrian German.",
            "That's right, okay.",
            "I haven't run that through our through our system to see if that makes a big difference. But I'm not sure that the Austrian German could cause problems for the recognition.",
            "And also the current MT systems on are actually adapted to this domain.",
            "Ok. Yeah, I thought that.",
            "The general purpose.",
            "Yeah, ok. So you know bet then. Than me. So I agree with what PERSON9 suggested that PERSON5 and PERSON11 should focus on the selection of the input. And test it probably like separately just on using PERSON11 direct tools. While PERSON10 and PERSON1 and PERSON9 will focus on the on the technical aspect. Right?",
            "Ok, just secondary topic. The schedule for the project officer. We identified 3 possible days which are Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Maybe can propose just Thursday and Friday.",
            "Yeah. Sounds a fair.",
            "What do you think?",
            "Yeah sounds a fair. With the yes no if need be.",
            "Ok. So I propose all of them or not.",
            "I don't know. How confident are we that we manage the plans ABC running at these one of them.",
            "In my opinion Thursday and Friday because once we.",
            "Yeah, let's go for Thursday and Friday.",
            "It fix the set up. Then we fix the quality. Then we have to fix the presentation. Which was another parts.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok. Well.",
            "Yeah, so now for the set ups. So the plan B, that I have with PERSON10 is that we will use this standard Youtube included Youtube iFrame within the presentation platform. And the Youtube iFrame will not have the auto play on. Instead it will only show the video, the pre-recorded one that we want to subtitle. And the subtitles will show instructions. The instructions would be like look at the subtitles now, we will do a countdown for you and on the click when you see the word click you need to click the play button on the video. And that way we can start the show at the same time on our side where it the recognition will start. And every participant will be suppose to click the play button when the instruction says so. I know that this is like very fallback-y solution. But still it's it's doable. If PERSON10 succeeds in injecting these instructions to the subtitles to all the languages. So that people would select all the languages and then they will see the subtitles telling them scroll back to the starting point, if the if the video has already started yet. Pause it and then wait for the click instruction so that you would be in sync. And if you get out of sync then you can try to re-synchronize yourself whenever you like. But we are not going to restart the main broadcasting. And we could simply say that this is due to the fact that we want to show real Youtube videos and we would have to clear copy rights to re-broadcast them. And that's like extra burden. So this is this is.",
            "I can also explain PERSON10 how to send let's say a free text to presentation platform through the.",
            "Ok. So there is a back door. There is another thing aside from.",
            "But it's not actually a back door, because it's the presentation platform has its own worker. And receives like for the worker so that we can actually call directly the worker. Instead of transcribe and later so on. So I feel it's pretty simple to paste directly text.",
            "Ok, that's, yeah. And we need to inject into all the languages.",
            "Yep. Actually it's a matter of make the script. The complex part probably is to let it be synchronized, let's say. And.",
            "No, the idea is that there would be first the instructions. And then these injection would stop release the worker. And immediately the full pipeline will start and this has to be tested so that the delay is like known how long it takes. Or there is no delay ideally. That would be even better. Maybe you can set it up because you know the presentation worker. You know how to set it up so there is no delay. So that more workers are connected there, but maybe that's.",
            "Ok.",
            "Start their playback simultaneously. Yeah. And the plan A, the re-broad casting on PERSON1 side. PERSON1, are you?",
            "Yes, sorry I was muted. Ok. I can add a pipeline for an extended audio from a video. And if there could be client it's working, I'm now putting it together with the other piece of the pipeline. So that the same call to FFM peg can also output the video streaming playlists.",
            "Yes, he is talking about the plan C.",
            "Yes, he is talking about plan C, exactly. So this is plan C.",
            "Yes. And I cannot find a way to be sure essentially. So.",
            "Exactly.",
            "There is no there is no practical way to be sure about this.",
            "Oh, ok, yeah.",
            "So. Yeah.",
            "Well it's not it's mainly technical so if there is no technical means which seems reliable then.",
            "No there're not. There is none.",
            "Yeah, then let's forget it. Let's forget plan, so.",
            "Essentially but I am I am still waiting on my personal Youtube account it's not able for streaming yet. So I cannot even test this.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Because there is a full day await it's not working yet, so.",
            "Yeah, ok. So let's let's simply forget plan A. It was, the reason to choose it was mainly because we knew how to present Youtube videos. In the in the PROJECT1 window. So there is. Yeah. And there is no way to do it when we want to replay some videos which were already previously uploaded to Youtube. So what we will do is we will we should demo the system transcribing and translating our speech as the meeting goes. And then this demo video. And for the our meeting. Sorry?",
            "Are you 100% sure to stream also the meeting?",
            "So well, to show the subtitling of the meeting. That's what I meant.",
            "Are you sure?",
            "Well, I think it's very good to explain how badly it like handles non-native speech. And none of us, including the project officer, none of us is a native speaker. Well PERSON5 is and PERSON11 is for German. But others, if we do this if we do the meeting in German, sorry the meeting in English. Then the most of us are non-native. And I think it's good to show how it handles that and how people can improve their pronunciation as they go. To get themselves better recognized. I think it gives us flexibility to show what it what it does.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "But if you if you disagree, then we can use the tested recording. Only. I would.",
            "I did. Well it sounds just risky in my opinion. First of all, it requires a completely different set up, respects to the one we are preparing for the file.",
            "Not really. This is just this is just the that PERSON10 needs to start the machine to follow the sound output whatever is being played. In his machine through the speakers. Is also immediately recognized and sent to the like in the in the pipeline.",
            "Ok, so that you are already able to catch the audio from the let's say.",
            "We have done that we have done that in the past. Few times.",
            "Ok.",
            "Just to be clear. These this thing PERSON14 is talking about does not pass through the service architecture.",
            "It does.",
            "It does?",
            "It passes through the service architecture, but it does not pass through Youtube or whatever. It's not related to the videos.",
            "And I mean is it the same thing we used yesterday?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok.",
            "So yesterday PERSON10 was following PERSON10 was running the pipeline. That was feeding the service architecture with the sound. And the sound was coming from PERSON10's output. So when PERSON10 was talking it was not part of the subtitles. And when we were talking it was part of the subtitles. Is that clear?",
            "Ok, let's take it as we as possibility to be tested.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, I will definitely propose project officer only Thursday and Friday.",
            "Ok.",
            "That's everything pretty it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok. Well.",
            "Yeah. So I would like to disconnect now. But so plan A is crossed, like we don't want to go for it. Plan B is something that PERSON9 will very quickly help PERSON10 with set up. And it should work. It should be fairly easy to set up. Plan C is what PERSON9 and PERSON1 will focus on. And it's the best solution. That we would really prefer. And please contact PERSON12. PERSON12 smashed right away he has some experience with the servers that we have. So that he would know what to ask the network administrators for.",
            "Ok.",
            "And PERSON5 and PERSON11 should select the video and test the performance. And this needs some deadlines. So that we know when to invite PERSON3 for the next test. She tendentially agree with Thursday, tomorrow afternoon. And Friday is a national holiday in the Czech republic, I don't know if it's the same for you.",
            "No.",
            "You don't have a national holiday on Friday, right?",
            "No. Ok, yeah. So.",
            "Did we even have national holiday, PERSON1? We had one in the first of May.",
            "Yeah, the first of May but no.",
            "Yeah, we have also the 8 of, the 8 of May.",
            "The 8 of May is nothing.",
            "Yeah, yeah. And one thing that I also wanted to talk PERSON10 is that we really need to test restarts. Everything can fail. So I told PERSON10 to be nasty once the test runs smoothly. He should just take out the internet cable and see what happens. And you should do similar things. So you should you should try killing your workers and slowing down the machines. And we need to know how to restart it quickly if this happens. So there is like do not test only for the success but test also for the recovery from a failure.",
            "Well. I think that probably the project officer also knows that both we online text flow and the presentation platform are developed for face to face conferences.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So that probably it will not be a problem to see some kind of.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "But be prepared to recover fast is always good idea. Since well you know, it's important demo.",
            "Yeah, ok, so let me disconnect now and you keep talking and oh this is this only end meeting. I don't want to end the meeting.",
            "You can end it also only for.",
            "For myself?",
            "Yep.",
            "I'll I'm I'm clicking the end meeting button now. But check it. Ok yeah I'll just leave the meeting. Yes. It allows me to leave it only. And it should be running for the rest of you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Ok it worked. Well PERSON5 and PERSON11, we are going to work on the technical set up. I don't know if it's interesting for you, or otherwise, sorry. I can.",
            "It would be interesting for me is if.",
            "Ok.",
            "Well if I have video that I think would be good but I can test it on our set up. We have a mediator too, we can I can test it on that presentation platform, but. If you have some way that I can just pipe audio into the ORGANIZATION6 mediator. And see the output of that system, that would be good. I mean of course it can used AB client but only for 1 language.",
            "In the cruise control Gitrepo are stored the ORGANIZATION5 scripts ORGANIZATION5 scripts used to make multiple streamings. For example of the 1 audio file into multiple translations. For example, we did it for example for the French watching session. Let me check it. Oh my gosh. PERSON10 do you have the scripts to run multiple translations simultaneously for PERSON11?",
            "Yeah, I have one right now. So it uses German ASR and English ASR. And it does the translation into I think 10 or 11 languages. So PERSON11 do you want me to share the script?",
            "Sure.",
            "Ok. And do you want for German ASR or with English ASR.",
            "A German.",
            "German ASR, ok.",
            "Do we have a chat here? Yes we have it. While PERSON10 prepares the.",
            "So I have sent PERSON11 an e-mail with that transmit, but it gonna affect the transcript.",
            "For all the others I copy the cruise control Github repo. In the set ups directory are stored all the ORGANIZATION5's scripts used in the various testing we did during the project years. For example the French watching the session does exactly this kind of scription translation.",
            "But I think that a French one might not work because it uses some worker which do not exist more.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which exist no more or which are have been obsoleted. And then which I sent to you guys it should be working at the moment. So you can try.",
            "Ok. And you should just like do dash the name of the file and yeah.",
            "Ok. Then I'm going to search for something for you PERSON10 in order to pipe text to the presentation platform. Meanwhile maybe it could be interesting to. Is it possible for us to look in on the HTTPS web server, the ORGANIZATION5 the ORGANIZATION5's one? Might be interesting to test everything directly in the final machine. What do you think?",
            "Yeah I think so, but I will be using basically 2 machines during the demo. 1 machine to run the set up and the other machine I think to inter to talk with VS. It will be both like for some laptops not the.",
            "Ok. For the plan B it works fine of course. For the plan C and as each access to the expose the server is required. Because did you get the plan C idea?",
            "C, just a moment.",
            "No I can re-explain it, don't worry.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "The idea is to log in on the ORGANIZATION5's web server. Upload on it the video file. Have the FFM peg tool installed. Upload also AB client with its libraries. I suppose it's it will be server. Then run FFM peg in order to create the M3U8 playlist which is a standard to for web streaming videos. And also provide on standard output the samples to be pasted in input to AB client. So actually we just 1 command. We will be able to both stream the video on a public URL and provide input to AB client. But in order to practice we should be able to write the video playlist file which is the M3U8 directly in the public directory.",
            "So yea the aplica this FFM peg pipeline needs write assess to the publicly exposed directory. It is not strictly required that the machine is the same if somehow the discs are available on the network on the inside. But you know.",
            "Ok, we have to ask to PERSON12 if I correctly understood in order to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok. So I need couple of minutes to recap our stream text to the presentation platform sorry you guys. Meanwhile PERSON1 is testing this idea of plan C, thank you PERSON1. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok, this, my internet connection is not that stable unfortunately.",
            "So could you demonstrate how the plan C which you're doing on your localhost right now?",
            "Sorry?",
            "Could you demonstrate the plan C which you're currently having.",
            "Ok, I can explain you one half the part which involves the video streaming.",
            "Ok.",
            "And the second part is the one who's working on PERSON1 in this moment. But I can share with you my screen maybe. Maybe. Stop video. Share screen, ok. Let me understand which one is the screen i have to share. Ok this one. This one. Which is. Ok, now you should see my shell.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok. It's just sharing this window so that if I show this part do you see my windows explorer or still the shell?",
            "We can see your shell.",
            "Just the shell. Ok. Ok. Ok now if I change window here you should see. Here the shell, and here the window. Is it correct?",
            "We see only the shell.",
            "Only the shell.",
            "Still only the shell.",
            "I see the window now but there is a huge delay.",
            "Ok. Yes unfortunately I told my hive do not have really performing the connection, sorry guys. And I'm also streaming the this. Maybe I can stop streaming my video for example. Stop video, ok. And hopefully this will work a little bit faster. Ok the idea is the following. In the windows folder, this one, the example acati docs streamer. This is a local apache server installed on my laptop. And the streamer is the exposed directory. So th so that if I publish a file in this directory this is switchable via web browser. We have the FFM peg command. We are going to fix it in order to performance likely better in terms of performances. Well, seek during the day. These takes an input the file Boris zero one zero one MP4 which is the video file I would like to stream. A lot of parameters.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Annually it writes the output in the acati docs stream directory. Ok.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok when I run it, it starts preparing smaller TS files which are the segments of the playlist. Act.",
            "It means it slowly increasing in size.",
            "Yep.",
            "Ok.",
            "In fact if we go back to the expose directory we will see that DTS files start appearing and being visited.",
            "Aha ok so it's like kind of frame window which is being updated every second or every few seconds.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok.",
            "Exactly. Our real is more fragment of video of 3 seconds.",
            "Aha, ok.",
            "If I connect to the exposure directory. Which is ok. This is, since I'm running apache on my laptop, i'm able to reach the expose directory through the web browser. And.",
            "Yeah, ok.",
            "Ok? I can refer to the index M3U8 file which is the index of the playlist.",
            "Ok, so can you play this video?",
            "And this is the video streaming.",
            "Ok.",
            "This kind of URL is accessible through the browser.",
            "Aha, ok I get it.",
            "I can put it also in VLC, for example in VLC you can open the network stream.",
            "Ok.",
            "Is exactly what it expects in input the presentation platform. Actually on my laptop I have a self signed SSL certificate. But ORGANIZATION5 and having the self signed certificates requires that each one who would like to access to the to the signed content needs to accept this certificate. Instead on the ORGANIZATION5 web server there's a regular certificate installed. So that it will be much more seeable for users to access to the HTS source. Because they do not require to accept or install do anything, it will work. Smoothly.",
            "So if I'm correct this video looks like till kind of broken.",
            "No I stop it.",
            "Ok.",
            "I just stopped it. Ok. It pretty works we nee we just need to tune the pipe. Ok. I'm going to search for the for the text input for presentation platform for you. Ok?",
            "Ok. So and now like our task is to if we go for plan C our task will be to anyhow transmit this video to guest, right?",
            "Well it depends. It depends. If you have seen.",
            "Like it should be publically available to the host persons of the meeting.",
            "Yep. We will have many option if you remember. We agreed that actually the. The project officer will see the demo through the screen so we'll be able to present both online text flow and the subtitles of the presentation.",
            "For this platform.",
            "The platform. In splitting the screen.",
            "Yeah, yeah it's splitting the window, yeah.",
            "Which is the solution used during the Monday seminaries. So that you should be pretty confident to organize the screen. Let the presentation be available. It looks also good because we will see both kind of the presentation nice.",
            "And how will he see the video?",
            "Yeah many option to see the video. For example we can organize still in the share screen put also a VLC for example which plays audio video. Or we can put the video in the presentation platform which actually has the box.",
            "Yeah. The video pin.",
            "Or we can ask to the participants to connect to the public URL. We will see which is the most performing solution. Actually in putting everything on the publics server. Will also grant us to avoid at least one part of the connection problem. Because you know if you play everything on your laptop. You will have the problem that you are on the conference call, streaming the audio, streaming the video. And this will probably kill your connection.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think the demo running actually remotely will let us at least let the demo run. Even if internet connection will at some point fail. Or not be back that good. But in any case we can not fix users internet connection problems, we.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If I, because, for example, if I'm joining the conference call. I'm downloading video and audio of all the participants. But if you I would like also to stream my web browser the video source for example. I'll in any case have a kind of delay. Well. Actually both presentation platform and online text flows are meant to work in locally and in face to face conferences. Are not meant for work for live streaming. But well I think it will be interesting to check it. Ok. I go back to the text problem. Ok. We should have still 35 minutes then I think we have to leave for lunch at least. And in the afternoon I will not be available because I'm in another meeting. But the idea could be to check now together all the possible problems. And things that we need to do together. And maybe schedule another test session for tomorrow. Try having fix during the afternoon or the set up and technical aspects. In order to proceed maybe tomorrow with transcription and translation and checking. That everything works and start making something more interesting also for PERSON11 and PERSON5.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Sorry guys.",
            "As for as I understand plan B is the most easiest and I mean like. Plan C seemed like it's like overloading the system too much. If your if your like running the whole SLT system. And if you're also streaming it's like using up your internet connection as well.",
            "In fact in my opinion putting everything on a different machine letting the demo run remotely. We will help us a lot. But please PERSON10 touch with PERSON12.",
            "Ok.",
            "Because he not a plan C in any case we need to be able to access to the published to the public server.",
            "Ok. Ok.",
            "Ok. PERSON1. Maybe do you have the client C client. Commands this one.",
            "The audio client?",
            "Maybe well you not the tixati client the one who sends text I do not remember how it's called. We have one Linux client in the ORGANIZATION6 platform.",
            "So.",
            "Switching to Italian just one second. Ok sorry guys. I need to make search.",
            "Ok so i'll talk to PERSON11.",

            "Yeah, it will be problem with writing of PROJECT3 paper but it not really related to, PROJECT4. It could be black box paper as well, so yeah, I, I will decide and I will talk to, with on LOCATION1, they would like to have this paper in, in PROJECT3. And because, yeah, we, we need one, one more jurnal paper so if we have nothing and...",
            "Is, is deadline the last, deadline -",

            "So this is already -",
            "This is already done because we have one paper from PROJECT7 and other from PROJECT2 and now that this one is, yeah. For PROJECT2 as well. Yeah, so we have three, three papers type D, we have no papers so far like OTHER7 or PROJECT1. So maybe we will have but we don't know yeat but -",
            "Yeah, this three conference papers are already, we already have. And I promise two jurnal paper and now we have only one so far so...",
            "But, but I think that the, the paper, the LOCATION1 paper could, could go there to the so, so problem we can, we can do it to Archive and PROJECT3 so that someone can read it. OK, so now the book. So maybe we can, everyone can say what, what was done the last week.",
            "Well I started working yesterday and I, I only written one paragraph and half which I haven't pushed yet, so it's not there. But I'm really starting to getting to it and also I am done with teaching this semester so I will just work on the book from nowone so -",
            "So I was mostly over, overnight I was mostly like getting back to what's where and what I, I need organize things. But I started writing and I expect there to be more written today and on Thursday and definitely on Friday.",
            "OK, so, so PERSON3 -",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Structure.",
            "Yeah, so I managed to, to start working so maybe the mainly I was doing what PERSON4 was doing so getting back to work but, I, I was restructuring the, the chapter so it's lot of mess, but I started adding some information from some papers that, that was, was not there yet. So I added, I don't now like one or two pages.",
            "You mean in, in the section six or chapture six?",
            "Yeah, yeah somewhere in chapture six.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And, yeah, so now I'm trying to structure the, yeah, to all the, modules chaptures some morfology so what they say, what morfology is captured and how will it is captured and there is no big difference between the individual models so. Then, I want go into in so much details about the models and some of the information I have there has to be like merged together and, and restructured and, and some information has to be added so I'm working on it. And I think this week I should have some time to, to do it again. And some of the things removed into the, what is it, notable models or how we called it?",
            "Yeah, what is section three.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Or two? Three.",
            "So, so in notable models there is now a bit of rubbish because there is something that I just moved from my chapture but they were not finished even when they were in my chapture and now they moved to different chapture so it will see. Yeah, I don't no who, who is responsible for the chapture? If, if PERSON11 will write it or whose wr.",
            "Yes, I will. I'm actually half, half through it right, right now.",
            "Just before the meeting I, I, I pushed, I pushed somethind and, and that's like a first half of the chapture and, and the second half I probably use something of, of what you copy there and delete work so just half you, you had from the chapture probably so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, I think that's OK. So, so I, so my take is OK? I don't have to care about, notable models and you will just delete my stuff and everything will be fine.",
            "You can rely this, yeah.",
            "Cool. Yeah, I will to some preface, I think it looks nice.",
            "Preface? Yeah, I, I, preface to the book?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't think it looks nice but it's at least something that you can criticize and, and re, rewrite. I thought it's, it's very to have something that we can start with then, then have lorem ipsum.",
            "OK, great.",
            "Nice.",
            "I'm reading it on, should I continue? Maybe, yeah, we will, we will read on the and then commented. Yeah, what I was doing? I was mainly, changig the chapture, the section about, about, where it is, different attention heads and transformers, different, different styles or different... Right, yeah, I write some, some figures from our, from our paper but till I've no, I did, I did the attention head into many, many like many templates, or not templates, many styles like attending to the same position, attending to the adjustement position but they are no styles nonvertical, mix style there is something vertical and are balustrades which are, which only appears in, in nation, in a PROJECT5 but it should be there and the block which, li, like two, two squares in the, in the visualisation with, whitch mainly are, in PROJECT8. There are more than one sentence at the input and the othere types of heads. And but I have only some of the visualisation because only, only some of there were in our experiment with PERSON3 so I will need to, to generate, to get the, get the same or the similar metrices from the, from the PROJECT8 as well so I, I'm planning to, to - Maybe you already have something?",
            "I don't have, PERSON3 want to.",
            "Yeah, but, yeah. Like the sim, the similary not just decide.",
            "In, in this color.",
            "Yeah, it should, maybe the color should be changed because it would be better to have it like the to be white to that the lines are visible there, so let the I will changed it and I will regenerated maybe more, more to the on PROJECT8 as well so could be can compared, better. So this is about like different attention head types in, in transformers like in, mainly in PROJECT5 and in PROJECT8 and on and, then it should continue by the section with, getting syntax from, from the self attention heads or getting syntax, yeah, getting syn, syntax from self attention heads and then that is something could PERSON1 is going to write in his survey as well.",
            "So maybe we can, we can share this section, somehow. To that we write it only once and no twice.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So far there are only some, I don't -",
            "In better states probably PERSON1 can now work with you on the attentions because my chapture is, is a real nice so I think it would be hard to introducing you now.",
            "OK. So we can, we can - Yeah. For now we can work with PERSON1 with, these, lend getting syntax from attention metrices only, from attention heads and yeah, I if only some, some papers and some notes to each of the paper when there are, there were doing something like something grated. And yeah, so this is, this is how to get like the relations and then I have a section about really inference of syntax trees based on the, based on the attention. And it is, it is something very similar on these, this we're we get the same paper, papers cited so... So on these two chapt, sections I would work with PERSON1 and yeah, there, yeah, about two papers or maybe more papers about highly head, attention heads which is still missing and then, some papers about that att, attention heads are not interpretable on why, there are not or why it should be interpretable. So I haven't continue with this, this week so but I would like to finish it somehow, maybe I will, yeah...",
            "Let's go so moving forward now.",
            "Sorry?",
            "We're moving forward now like in, in the past weeks it was -",
            "Yeah, th, this is from the, from the past weeks. This is for, from the past week I, I already written so do you so -",
            "What I did the last week it was only the led to these pictures.",
            "These, this -",
            "So PERSON12, wha, from what you, what you have written, what is, what is cohere and unfinished enough that, that you would like to be at some feedback on?",
            "I think that, but you already went trough this, somehow trough this, types of attention heads, so I, I, I have changed it somehow, there are very small text and I added the figures it, it is - Yeah, it is cohere but it's the missing the end like the discussion at the end of this, of this, paragraph at least and some pictures are missing still.",
            "OK.",
            "So I would like to regenerate and show more examples not only from PROJECT5 but also from PROJECT8 so...",
            "Alright.",
            "So I've added something but it's more coherened but it still, yeah, changed somehow if you try to post so yeah.",
            "And it's, it's question for, for, for everyone. It's there anything you would like me to read?",
            "Not yet. But I will, I expect to send you, something by the end of the week.",
            "Alright.",
            "Yeah, I could also sen, let you know when, when this is the, this, the, this section is finished so that you can read it.",
            "Cool.",
            "And, and, yeah, we are in the book. I, I still dream that we could have it somehow at the end of at June in some share which is readable and we passed it to the reviewers. But, yeah, maybe I don't ask someone if, if you can, if we don't manage it by, by the end of June what we should do but, I don't want to do it now because when we know that the deadline is postponed we will not do anything so -",
            "What about the reviewers? Do we know, who will get the reviewers? So are we supposed to get the reviewers? So how does it work?",
            "Maybe we should, we should, we can, we can, specified what reviewers we would like -",
            "And about that we have to talk with, I will, I will, I will write to, to PERSON7 to - I, I already talk with him and he said that, yeah, we will do it somehow and we will find someone, someone, somebody but -",
            "And how there informed requirements? Like, like does it have to be someone whose at least a professor and then someone whose from, from other institution or whether.",
            "I figured they, they need to be from, from the other, outside this, outside this building, not on the this building, outside - Building, maybe out, yeah, someone not from our university. At least not from our faculty.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "We still have, we will have like more money on, on this grant because, because, we had like 40, 50000 on conferences and I don't know how much we will spend -",
            "Because it will be 5000 for PROJECT2 only and -",
            "PERSON1 is writing a survey maybe to PROJECT7 or maybe or it will be maybe better text it maybe it should go to some better place than PROJECT7 only.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or it can be, yeah.",
            "I think PROJECT3 is better then PROJECT7.",
            "I don't know. If you want -",
            "Because you wanted to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't have profit.",
            "But you don't need to -",
            "So it's also the reason.",
            "Money you don't need to have to and now so it's not -",
            "It's only if you, if you want to go to LOCATION5.",
            "Maybe it will be virtual as well so -",
            "Sorry?",
            "It's possible it will be virtual anyway.",
            "It's possible it will be virtual anyway so... It's up to you.",
            "But I would, if to, if the survey's really goog I think it could be better to send it to better, better place, better, better, better conference then black box, then PROJECT7.",
            "Where does the black box take place this year?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And what's the deadlines? I don't know when.",
            "The deadline is, it was posponed to the middle of August.",
            "So that it is, the deadline is after the notification of PROJECT1.",
            "Maybe. Something like this. So they, they, they will see only the reviews and it's OK.",
            "I don't know.",
            "So deadline is the conference is November or?",
            "The PROJECT1 should be in November.",
            "In November. Than it maybe if physically if, if -",
            "I think PROJECT1 is officialy virtualised.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's, it's virtualised as well. So black box would by virtualised as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Everything is virtualised.",
            "I think the PROJECT1 all, allready did decision like, like -",
            "OK.",
            "It will be virtual.",
            "But we want missed the LOCATION7. It will be there in, in 2021.",
            "In the, the picture like of the location so it's just.",
            "OK, OK. Yeah, OK. Is LOCATION7.",
            "OK, so LOCATION7 is next year?",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, so... I should like start think about some really good - To get there.",
            "So I, I think PERSON1 where, where you have it finished we will decide where to -",
            "To, submited for PROJECT7 because PROJECT7 is only, like it's a conference like that I don't know what people will be, like it will be all from, from all the fields of informatics so maybe they will not understand much of much discussed if you this, this.",
            "They're writing about so it's only if you want to go to LOCATION5 and it's the other have but I don't know maybe it will be virtualised as well so -",
            "Yeah. They said it, that there is possible it will be virtualised and they're waiting to see. Definitely that there will be an option to participate remotely because they expect maybe some people want be able to travel.",
            "That make no sense to participate remotely.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it, it make only that you will have one point, in PROJECT6 but it's -",
            "Anymore. So because we have already 3, 3 points.",
            "So -",
            "OK and LOCATION5 is nice so if it's physicall then -",
            "Yeah, if it's fysicall it's, it will be nice so...",
            "Yeah, I think have try to send it there an older. Because so I need to send.",
            "Soon, right.",
            "It's before the deadline for the book so...",
            "Yeah, abstract submission is June 15th so it's on Monday and then there is one more week for weekend.",
            "Yeah there for, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Yeah. It's, it's like. Any papers.",

            "Yeah, they say weekend -",
            "Understand whether -",
            "Second type of paper -",
            "Yeah, I don't think they will have a hartch number of papers so -",
            "Yeah, I supposed they will have like three papers at most so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it is, it is only like, conference.",
            "So only if you want.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, they haven't special overview track but it will not be included in the proceedings.",
            "Yeah, so -",
            "Yeah, yeah, if it is -",
            "Yeah, it gonna be. Yeah. If it doesn't inquiry proceedings and if it is like not physically.",
            "It's like two options. Because overviews like overview was for alter like on words, the past or like.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Foreign.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So if, if to be to -",
            "And, and definitely you can, you can withdraw so they say, yeah, if you cross submit you must withdraw before submitting diversion and you is all this twelwe.",
            "So but it's before the black box for example. But -",
            "OTHER4 accept surveys?",

            "OK, so let's start. I sumbitted, last week, previous week, I submitted the paper I working to LOCATION3 to PROJECT5, PROJECT5. So we have the second, second -",
            "Article in the, in the journal. So we have, I think now we have everything what we have promised, for, for this grant. The book. PBML. So, yeah.",
            "I can't hear you PERSON14.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I can barely hear you.",
            "OK. So I will speak, speak up.",
            "Is it better now?",
            "I should the only one hear you, it's PERSON17. When you or he just - It's not good and I can hear.",
            "Sound settings, so. Input. Ha. Surely, surely the default micro, microphone is the camera mic. Now, I think that now you should hear us better.",
            "So it is better?",
            "Yes, it is.",
            "Yeah, great.",
            "But I can hear myself. Like one second later after I say something, I, I hear it once again.",
            "Ha, but it did not happen now. So maybe it just get fixed by itself. Alright. It's good now.",
            "OK.",
            "What was that? So, yeah. Yeah, should I say I, I haven't read our book for the last week and this morning I couldn't, I couldn't read it so I, I have no, I don't know how it is, in what shape it is now. Or maybe everyone of you can say what, what, what was done and what is still missing and what we read and... PERSON6?",
            "Yeah. I can do that.",
            "The book and -",
            "The book. The book. The book is here.",
            "With PERSON5 maybe.",
            "OK, the book is here and PERSON5 is there.",
            "So... Yeah, maybe is the, is the cabel from the long enough? OK, so...",
            "Maybe I can share the screen with PERSON5.",
            "So... The, this, this thigs right here. It's here?",
            "It's there. Yeah. No. OK, select window, you can select the - OK, I will select like PROJECT4 book. Now, now... You should now see the book. Now you see the book.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I do.",
            "OK, so I'm still missing the introduction so it's stil this, this, this bullets which I plan to rewrite into the text like one to put this text away. And I still didn't touch morfology so I still need to rewrite it into sentences. But the rest of the book or as rest of my chapter now should be kind of OKish so, it 's ready for comments I would say. Now for syntax, I split it into constituency syntax, dependancy syntax, some other things that I go up on syntax and I phase writed in the way that I tried to sumarize the knowledge and then add evidence from the papers. I took coreference at the separate thing because I see the something beetween syntax and semantics and for semantics, for some difference is missing. Missing before this somebody do something better to be fine.",
            "One maybe different, no, maybe - Just a minute. I, maybe I just didn't compile it properly. Where is the mas, where is the mas.",
            "Let me just surround... Yes. OK, I think it's still fix in self in.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And above the minute and half.",
            "Yeah, some for semantics a group semantic tagging and this kind of semantic rolebiling stuff I have noun gender at semantics. It's writed to the debiassing which I don't think it's trully ready. I don't know if maybe it is a negotiation in there's semantics but I. And word senses this is already there, seems a bit polishing. Word knowledge, yeah, I did that, context, I haven't seen what I've written there so I don't know if it's ready. And I, yeah, something happend?",
            "Yeah, so far the references text.",
            "Yeah, it's there.",
            "It's there.",
            "And there is, the comparison of individual architecture so it now somehow and I think PERSON14 had that PERSON10 has a survey re, related to this. Like what, like we were -",
            "Yeah, and, and -",
            "So, so - So probably you can look at what's here and then -",
            "And see what, what -",
            "What can be added or merge. And this was already done before and, yeah, this one is probably still. And yeah, the multilinguality I basically just copy-pasted the paper we have with PERSON5. So not, not the whole paper but kind of the introduction and related work and I tried to rearrange it, put it into the book but maybe it's too long and too detailed because it would long on detail in the paper so, oh, and PERSON5 added the centroids, you did there.",
            "Yep.",
            "Nice. And, yeah, and I wrote a conclusion, to that's high level view so, so I, it should be mostly in a good shape. It's a 40 intro and the morfology.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK, so - So we can read it now and comment it.",
            "Yeah, I think so. Yeah.",
            "I skimmed trough the multilinguality section and I still have the question I, I had in slack. When it is our work, should we like pretend it's some, it's, it's the self as someone else work? Or should we like explicitely play this is our contribution? Because you said PERSON27 and al say something, shouldn't we rather say we, we say something?",
            "Yeah, I don't know. First, first I had it like... The other way, then I changed it that, that we -",
            "We made this and they made that.",
            "But I don't know. I don't have any opionion with -",
            "I think -",
            "What is, what is better?",
            "I think we still want to sign the paper so -",
            "Yes, we do.",
            "So the different where you say PERSON27 and al did that or we, PERSON27 and al did that. I don't know.",
            "Or, or we -",
            "I don't see a big difference actually.",
            "I do.",
            "Well, also, the definition of the \"odborná kniha\" -",
            "Should say that, that, that it should be our, our general awork so we can if you want to pretend that it's like, that we present our original work in a context of, of other work then we should explicitely -",
            "I don't think -",
            "Claim what, what ou, what's ours.",
            "Yeah, I think we agree that our work is doing the survey, I know, well, you know.",
            "Yeah, I, I think, yeah. It, it looks better if we refer to our work in, in the same way as, as the other.",
            "But, yeah. I don't know what is -",
            "Like my understanding is that like writing the book is our own work but I don't know. Like people publish survey books and I don't know if they fit the definition but I don't see problem there. Like we read the papers and we interpreted what we found and we commented on it somehow that - Like in I, I feel that in some herious like I don't know historical research is open the only thing you do you. Get some sources and just comment on them so -",
            "Yeah. I - We, yeah, we can also book into other, other book.",
            "So made for, for this type of grant of they reffer to their own paper.",
            "Or -",
            "Why would you, why would you refer to your own paper and someone else's paper. It's like, the usual reason is that you have to prepare the manuscript for a doubleblind review but that's not the case here.",
            "But -",
            "Yes.",
            "It's not how the person the same authors as the authors of the book anyway so it is like on some even.",
            "Yeah, the thing is that if you refer to your papers in the different way then the other papers, the, the whole book looks like more, more like, that you present your work in context of the other. For us if you refer to older papers on same way like more like survey.",
            "I don't know. On the other hand if you refer to your papers as someone else's paper it looks like, what do you call it in English, like don't appeal to authority which is not there like...",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know. If trust my paper's more than some of the other papers that I refer to.",
            "Well but - I still think that you should like present them like your papers but, as, it's something that community. Also like naturally that's exactly what you are saying. You are biass words your own papers and I think that -",
            "The reader has the right to know that -",
            "You might be biass to -",
            "Yeah. That's right. Because other way should, we wouldn't choose -",
            "Our papers.",
            "Papers as, yeah.",
            "And by pretending that like or pretending, nice, refering to the paper as someone else's paper you I disbiass from the reader.",
            "It's anyway, in the book.",
            "Yeah, well, but the, the reader -",
            "Yeah. So imagine it's like PERSON22 and PERSON1 and no idea like, OK, some random Chinese names and so -",
            "And the discussion in the multilinguality paper, we, we kind of claim that, that the evaluation of the multilingual representation is, is not really showing the part and espects of the multilingual representations and we, and we take a really critical view on the other papers and, and say, our paper is the good one. Which sounds really weird if li, if we like pretain this is the objective des, description from distance how, how it is. Because we'll taking the strong publicion in this case.",
            "We'll probably taking the same position in other case in where, where we write in the book something or? Like I have other cases where I think that would be authors that doesn't show anything and, or show something else and I say this in the book so. I don't seem big difference. PERSON5 But the difference is that, that you say, this is what the paper says and, and this is what we think and -",
            "And, and here you say, this is what the other papers say and this is what PERSON27 and al say and, and, and it gives a feeling of like, a feeling for the authority of the, of another paper.",
            "Which, which is not, not really the case. This is still us thinking that, that, that our is better than, than the other one.",
            "I can see actually this paper I'm citing it's PERSON27, PERSON23, PERSON7, so -",
            "Do we say, we and PERSON7 think this or? How would you say this cause you cannot really say we when you think we and PERSON7 but not all of us cause maybe PERSON17 and PERSON14 don't think so because they're not authors of the paper? So -",
            "So OK, like if you, if you really want to be a \"ORGANIZATION4\" - Then you write some of us and PERSON7 -",
            "Some of us and some other people.",
            "But I think you can just write we.",
            "I think do -",
            "Unlike if, if the reader is interested in -",
            "Precisely are that, there's the citation.",
            "Yes. These we should agree.",
            "OK.",
            "We, we -",
            "We would say, we and, and the reference.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "That, this and there.",
            "Yes, yes, yes.",
            "The, the reference has to be there in any case.",
            "Yeah, yeah. OK.",
            "Well that if you consider the paper to be like mostly I think maybe.",
            "Anywhere is a paper that we, you have just in, you're like the -",
            "Sixth author out of ten -",
            "Then you can say, whohever and al.",
            "OK. So, so we have agreed on saying we and then adding the reference. Yeah?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. And I'm thinking. Yeah, I say the authors so it should maybe - Yeah. The authors. It's probably more but...",
            "OK, so, so who would -",
            "Yeah, so, so I just but, but briefly over it because I think anyway the plan is that well I, I try to fix the missing parts and you can start reading it and commenting it and it probably doesn't make sense to go over it now.",
            "No, no, it - Yeah, I think, yeah. So, is anyone who, who read it all? All, the whole book or?",
            "No.",
            "No.",
            "OK. OK, so - So could I - Let's - Maybe - So who... O, OK, let's go from the beginning to the end of the book and, and see what is, what is there. Briefly see what is, what is missing there or what, what's not.",
            "Other. OK. Is there, is too there.",
            "And I still think we should find the better motto.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yep. We should -",
            "Or we should write the book first.",
            "Yeah, it's - Yeah.",
            "And maybe read it as well.",
            "Yeah, so maybe read it. Yeah, maybe someone should, should maybe comment here what is, what is not there. OK, the phase two. PERSON5, you, you have, haven't change the first, first chapter of the book?",
            "No.",
            "So maybe, yeah. So maybe we still need to there.",
            "The chapter full off ugly arrows is still there.",
            "OK. The notable models.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Copied something there and I would probably delete it.",
            "OK. So there are, so this is the language model, 24, delete. Word2vec was also copied by PERSON17.",
            "No, that's, that's PERSON5's favourite.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I don't know what to do with these two -",
            "Probably delete them.",
            "Yeah, it -PROJECT2. Because - Yeah. I would start with Word2vec. Then what is there, attentions. Transformer, PROJECT2... Because the language models start with - With PROJECT2, yeah.",
            "I mean, I mean language model, neural language models started 15 years before PROJECT2.",
            "Yes, but - Yeah, I mean, notable neural models.",
            "So I don't know how, if this, this could, could be included somehow or delete it.",
            "I'm not sure either.",
            "Well, I discussed how, how neural language model works in, in the previous chapter. What I, what I talk about the architectures.",
            "And this chapter only, only presents like the notable models, the models that we are talking about later in the book.",
            "OK, so the section about the neural language models should maybe be merged to the previous chapter or deleted if it's superfilus.",
            "Yep.",
            "Overwrite.",
            "So PROJECT1, yeah. How much we use GPT in the, in the, in the.",
            "I'm refered to it, I don't say much about it, so maybe find anything really special about GPT wri, written. I refer much to PROJECT2 and PROJECT1.",
            "Yeah, I, I also refer to it. So we can, we can delete, yeah. If you find that is OK.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "OK, so -",
            "In the chapter I commented on PERSON5's comments... He didn't comment on my comments on its comments.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is already complete, PERSON17?",
            "Or the -",
            "Or it's something what's missing?",
            "As, as, as I wrote somewhere I'm not sure maybe in ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Yeah, you, you - The PERSON6's ORGANIZATION2.",
            "The first part, is com, I think it can be viewed as complete and in the - There are some to do things there but I think there are like optional. If we like there, there is more potential interesting things that we could write about if we read them carefully and so on but, they don't really have to be there but then probing is not finished, unsupervised methods -",
            "Yeah, will be there.",
            "And to probings need to be merge... On this is new here what I've written. Then there on this thing.",
            "So, yeah. So the unsupervised method, this is some, like something what is.",
            "Yes.",
            "What is in PCA and ICA and -",
            "Yeah. And first thing enough, the facial tutorial basically... Oh, well, only mention these methods in the visualisation section. So forently trying to do something, quantitative with these methods is not very common.",
            "Yeah. OK.",
            "You can write it to the chapter?",
            "What?",
            "What?",
            "That you can write it in, in, in the chapter? That the ORGANIZATION5 tutorial, mention these methods only for, only for visualisation and, and it's probably not comment you to use them quantitatively.",
            "We do use them quantitatively visualisation.",
            "Oh, I do.",
            "You want to say I reffer somewhere to somebody who use PCA to identify the, gender biass component.",
            "Yeah, also - Yeah, actually I also remember some paper.",
            "For example The principals of meaning. Which also uses PCA quantitatively.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. The, the PERSON5 paper for multilinguality this uses clustering which even evaluate for the multi indentification. So there is a visualisation but it's also use for, like quantitative evaluation.",
            "And then the introduction of is of unsupervised.",
            "So it's too divided the methods for probing and unsupervised.",
            "Yes.",
            "So... Then probing is defined or?",
            "Well, these are just notes from my theses proposal. These are some other notes as well.",
            "So I haven't, I haven't read that but, but, yeah. It's defined but I don't, yeah, we should say what we mean by probing and, put the history of this theme that probing in the, yeah - The past it was these model, is that use for many, many methods, different methods and...",
            "Also the ICA tutorial was talking about, about behaviour texting. Are we mentioning this too?",
            "Not yeat.",
            "Why not?",
            "And, and should, should we or shouldn't we mention it?",
            "That's a good question.",
            "Like real testing is?",
            "I don't know. For, for instant for gender biass it's, it's, it's, the doctor came into the room and mask said that and, and, and you want to test what's the probability of he and she being the word it. This an example of, of behaviouris testing. Or PERSON2, probe PROJECT1 for some syntax ability using, using this like, like designing the set of comp, of syntactically complicated sentences and, and was looking what's the probability of the, of the correct, cor, syntactic correctly words. Being predict by PROJECT1. So this is behaviouristic testing.",
            "Yeah, the point is that you read the model as a blank ones only, usually you can struct some interesting thing that you something about a bit of the model. But yeah. I don't really refer to any such papers in my chapter. Maybe do I -",
            "Yeah. So I don't know the, who, who is the gender biass section?",
            "I do.",
            "PERSON17.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well -",
            "We don't refer to that but we can still say in this, in this, in this chapter that, that there is another way of testing the models and, and we are not interested in these methods.",
            "OK. So, you have the some predics.",
            "Yeah. I don't know, that is not yet. Who do you want?",
            "I want the - To do added somewhere after the unsupervised methods because -",
            "Which file?",
            "In which file? Interpretation.",
            "Before this section.",
            "Hidden states only. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, I want to do that says behaviour. What's the ending of the word?",
            "IST. And the vaticular.",
            "This, right. I have my notes from the tutorials somewhere here. Behavioral.",
            "Behavioral. OK.",
            "And if -",
            "Which I don't know from the, from the, the, the -",
            "Yeah, these are also the tutorial, they're rather brief. I posted a link to this document in the slack.",
            "Yeah. Can I, can I, can I watch the tutorial or?",
            "Yeah, I posted the link to the tutorial in ORGANIZATION2.",
            "Aha, OK. I will, I will -",
            "Well, I have send directly into livelive or what is also, you can watch it there. And there is also a part about interaction and I'm not sure if we want that as a section?",
            "What does it mean?",
            "Where is the window with PERSON5?",
            "Do we want to discuss interaction?",
            "What does it mean?",
            "I'm not sure. Already things to be since the tutorial - I forgotten most of what I haven't written down here. What was in the interaction part? We can look at the slides on the tutorial.",
            "I don't know.",
            "Where is the ORGANIZATION2 here?",
            "Here.",
            "Here is the ORGANIZATION2 link. And here are the slides, all 190 of them. Hi, I'm PERSON9.",
            "PERSON9. Our book.",
            "Probing, classifiers. There is PERSON6's analysis. And behavioral analysis. And there are examples here and... Oh, behavioral analysis.",
            "How long is this tutorial? 3 hours?",
            "Yeah, almost 3 hours. And I think like the, the women who, women who talks about the behavioral analysis takes like, an hour and half from them and she says, what she says can be summed up in like 15 minutes but.. Yeah, the says what was terrible at this meeting. There are usual analysis. OK, clustering, clustering, clustering and where is the - OK. An interactive visualisation. OK, I think for some reason more like the interactive thing was, was making thing -",
            "You mean, you mean the Java script thing that he, that the guy was showing.",
            "Yeah, but for some reason it was mention separately in this, somewhere... Yeah, I'm in the beginning again. Let's find it there. There should be some summary slide at the beginning I think.",
            "Oh, I don't think that, that's relevant for the book at all. I mean he was talking about how to -",
            "OK.",
            "To, to come up with hypotheses that can be later quantitatively tested.",
            "Yeah. So we don't have to mentioned interaction.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like the of word embeddings. This the what is it?",
            "Yeah, this is the interactive visualisation.",
            "Yeah. I don't know how this more like what was the embeddings.",
            "Then they mentioned other methods and I don't remember what other methods did they talk about. Conclusion, conclusion. Interactive visualisation. It doesn't seem that they mention any other method. Yeah, but here you can see that like, and this is like, yes, like that. OK. And can I actually share this with PERSON5?",
            "You can move it to the entire screen and share.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No, this is, just the window is share. Presenting, start presenting again. Let's, I can actually share the second screen and now I can move, well, I can move this, this thing here. Yes. Do you see the slide?",
            "Yes, I do.",
            "Well, so here is like basically say then they are too brought approaches structure of, structure of probing and PERSON20 says and says are the, the behavioral thing.",
            "Yep.",
            "And then the visualisation is like a technic dot, can speed dot exploration but they don't really consider it, the a...",
            "Like interpreting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so we... I think we have a different approach with the accent on unsupervised methods that, that we consider real methods and not just, some -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Expiration thing.",
            "The, their, their probing, methods were all like thing the -",
            "Supervised.",
            "Supervised classifire.",
            "I think so.",
            "Or something.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yeah, like most of the - I think most of the, PERSON9's part of the corel is concerned with, the classifires and like the discussion around should the classifires be simple or should they be powerfull and memorization.",
            "Is there an outcome?",
            "Well, not really.",
            "In lot of the papers that I see too they seem to kind of the steam that if, if just the linear classifire or linear probe then it's kind of OK. And, and -",
            "Yeah, but then I can show you in the or I - I do - Well. Yeah. Here. And al. Argue that we should always choose the most complex probe since it will maximize the mutual information. And yeah. And not really - No. Yeah, then PERSON25 and PERSON21 mesure the probe complexity and probe quality and compare them. Both of these. Most of these, both of these papers are from 2020 and I haven't read, read them yet. I'm not, I'm not sure that I follow this argument here.",
            "Yeah, actually didn't get the thing what, what the mutual information that PERSON9 was talking about.",
            "Yeah, me neither. Or maybe we, maybe we should read and al.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, but, yeah - So I think the, the conclusion was that like people are discussing it and there are different approaches.",
            "Well, a few years, ago people were as he said, sort of, the word is - Assuming -",
            "That the, the linear classifire will not memorize and that's a good thing.",
            "Well, there is a discussion but probably no.",
            "No con, no conclusion yet. I would say.",
            "Yeah. I mentioned.",
            "Yeah, this is PERSON6.",
            "The. I also didn't like understand this part of the thought.",
            "OK.",
            "Well, yeah, I think that this maybe some. So... Yeah, the jerson alternative way to do things. But - That's all that PERSON9 said. So here we should mention the behavioral analysis we can, we should probably explicitely mention that our classification is some what uncommon when the accent un, unsupervised methods.",
            "Yeah. Because half of the, half we are chapter and almost whole of my chapter is unsupervised and the PERSON6's is -",
            "Also this, this is also unsupervised method, the neural.",
            "Not really. Like -",
            "You train -",
            "Well -",
            "Train but -",
            "You didn't train anything but you're constructing, you're like - Yeah, like you constructed a supervise data set. Like for example in case of the biass detection you're constructing a data set yourself and that's the supervision, right. You're - You have to -",
            "When it -",
            "Like there have to be a person who decides if, if -",
            "Yes.",
            "Like who decides the examples... But yeah, maybe it's something but doesn't really thinking to this -",
            "Yeah, I think it's something different if I to this thing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe cause it is not -",
            "Yeah, I would say that we should -",
            "Maybe we should follow PERSON9 in, in classifying like the probing and our unsupervised methods as structure analysis.",
            "That's one thing.",
            "And then the behavioral analysis is -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Something different.",
            "It's something different.",
            "Maybe can you want to learn some things like what's there, what's not there so.",
            "Yeah, we can the. You don't train anything.",
            "Or you use structure task. OK.",
            "I know some people train, train a model to do machine translation and they say, yeah, it's morfology translation to the most of the behavioral, tested on the task for which it was trained kind of.",
            "Well, not necessarily. Like I sort of but you're testing specific thing -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like in case of language modeling -",
            "Well, you're not testing language modeling if you're only testing the structure -",
            "Not, not in general but, but you're using just kind of observing the behavioral on -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The virtual task or sort of you can find data set maybe -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Task same.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, I probably have some, some things like that and think that I interpret but I didn't know the, yeah, maybe I should comment.",
            "OK, so... We'll do, we'll do write them. So PERSON17, you can?",
            "Yeah. OK.",
            "You can write the probing and -",
            "Probing -",
            "Someone who should - Yeah. Add the other methods to unsupervised methods because defined that only that.",
            "And clustering with missing slash.",
            "OK. Or clustering.",
            "Yeah. And so you should mention the, behavioral thing. Yeah. Yeah. What we should do with this hidden states corespondence thing could work. I - Yeah. Because - It is across of all the, all the chapters done.",
            "Or - PERSON17, you, you use only, only -",
            "No. I, I don't have any hidden states so...",
            "Yeah, you don't have any hidden states. So -",
            "Yeah, I was vistualisation.",
            "Yeah. OK.",
            "Although I didn't really, yet.",
            "Which was -",
            "For my chapter and for PERSON14 chapter.",
            "For my chapter, yeah.",
            "Yeah, there and other things. This, this is also problematic part like when you have subwords and you need, your isn't forwards so and you just averages together or -",
            "Yeah. So maybe we should like... Like do a section here.",
            "And maybe some subsection.",
            "But there is another subsection about word sense subword.",
            "I think I have two.",
            "Yeah, I will, I would write it here.",
            "Aha, OK.",
            "You're right.",
            "Yes. Because I have information like this in, in like two more them -",
            "And which of as well because at is.",
            "Yeah, so I and what this is and - I now have rewrite.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I, I'm repeating like in one sentence.",
            "Yeah, it is -",
            "Cause it's really important thing that -",
            "Yeah. Repeat.",
            "So this is still copied from, from your -",
            "I haven't updated. I don't know if somebody touched it.",
            "Probably not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes. It looks like my text.",
            "So maybe I, I, yeah. I don't know. Maybe I would let is as it is now and when, when we read it we can, we can comment and then, then we.",
            "OK and...",
            "OK and... What are we going to do with the comments on comments? Are you going comment to this -",
            "Although -",
            "Or should we maybe arrange a separate call and discuss it?",
            "The best thing would be if you, if you write there what, what I was suggesting. If - The worst case for me if, is, if I write it but yeah, I think th, this is something that, that, that should be mentioned that -",
            "I mean these comments where, yeah.",
            "Yep. That, that people, who, we are citing are not people doing NLP. That these concepts come from, general machine learning community and even in the general machine learning community this is, this is li, like, like the mainstream. Means from interest. And that people in the machin, in, in NLP community started to be interested in interpretability only, only recently. Th, this is basically what I was suggesting to add in, into this column.",
            "Yeah, and then I have question for other comment. For example here I don't know what the comment means. And there was another one but it's not here somewhere. There. Oh. OK. Well -",
            "Are - Aha, in the, yeah, in the other comment.",
            "Yeah, usually. Or sometimes in the middle.",
            "Who are the people? The, this is explained in s, in the next sentence. Or in the rest of the comment that, that these are not NLP people but these are machine learning people.",
            "Yeah, I still don't really know what you mean so you would have to write it yourself.",
            "Well, I'm asking question who are the people and the answer is these are machine learning people.",
            "Who are what people? There is no -",
            "That you're citing in the previous, in, in the previous chapter. It's PERSON15, PERSON18, PERSON11.",
            "OK. OK, yeah. OK, now I'm starting to get your point.",
            "They have nothing in common with NLP, they have nothing to common in lingu, what linguistics.",
            "Well, it's nothing important.",
            "I think so. Because this book is about NLP and, and linguistic structures and we are using methodology, that comes from different fields.",
            "You are about linguistics. Structures. I mean - I'm in, in this, this chapter is about interpretation of neural networks and specifically this first part is about the general term, concept of interpretation and there, there's like -",
            "Some probably -",
            "There's, I, at least I don't know about any discussion that would, that would, approach this specifically from the NLP ten points so linguistic -",
            "PERSON9 does. Or the PROJECT3 was, was from the, from the NLP perspective.",
            "Yeah, sure about he didn't really, talk about interpretation. He didn't talk about the concept, right. He just -",
            "Yep.",
            "Listed several methods and that's, the point of this chapter it that, yeah, unless you like list methods, there's no, there's no general consensus on what interpretation means. There are only list of. Yeah, so...",
            "Yes, and this is not discussed in, in the NLP community but in the machine learning community and, and this is what I think we should mention.",
            "I don't see how that's any relevant.",
            "OK. But -",
            "I agree that probably explicitly say that here we're talking most interpretation of the in general, not NLP. Then if there is something specifical for NLP, we should say in NLP usual.",
            "OK.",
            "Like I don't know like for example the chapter that PERSON14 has, so do you think into the attentions. I don't know if people do this NLP.",
            "Sure they do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In... Visual things.",
            "OK.",
            "Like -",
            "Yeah, that's right, yeah.",
            "They did it way before -",
            "NLP people did.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Why is this thing.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. I, I agree with PERSON6 that -",
            "That, that this the, the indroduction here should, should stay that it's talking about the thinking general.",
            "Yes, please. But I don't think that it's important to mention who the people are but if you think that it's important then, means mention it.",
            "OK.",
            "OK, so should we to the next -",
            "I think, stories.",
            "Stories.",
            "I'm not sure there is - I'm not sure if there are stories like -",
            "Yeah.",
            "No, we - We, I don't know what is concept of stories but -",
            "Concept of -",
            "I don't know about the author -",
            "Yeah.",
            "But my chapter is end of story.",
            "Yeah. I did realize so -",
            "Maybe we should -",
            "We should say that is -",
            "Change the name. So what is that -",
            "Yeah. For me it's rather some kind of questions from neural word or -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know whether we should have the two sections on the book so maybe we can -",
            "I think the two sections are good like -",
            "Yeah.",
            "This is really introduction kind of and the second part are the of findings. I can see quite the through the vision there.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I want them like the - I don't think the, the first section should be named background. We should come up with some more specific name.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then the second it's part of the -",
            "Yeah, this is part.",
            "Part.",
            "Yeah, the second part shouldn't be named stories and why is there this third part?",
            "Because you, you picked somewhere I, I part of. Maybe it should.",
            "Because it was in a template.",
            "Sorry?",
            "The third part is there because it was in a template.",
            "Was it?",
            "There was - Yeah, I think it was called conclusion.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Originally.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe conclusion, conclusion and summary.",
            "Each other and like technically it's a separate part.",
            "Yeah. It should be the, yeah -",
            "Maybe, maybe it shouldn't be a separate part.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is not part of the second part.",
            "I don't think there should be this page.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's actually, it shouldn't say.",
            "Or, or this little book.",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "Yeah, the, the, OK. The only chapter of the third part, the third part is the summary.",
            "Yeah. And then there are -",
            "So maybe it's, it could be called summary.",
            "Yeah, because -",
            "But then summary and summary.",
            "When it's just called summary, it's not very clear like suddenly this is all summary of the whole book cause it looks like another chapter in the second part or maybe the, the last chapter.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, so I think it should be somehow separated more clearly.",
            "Yeah, but we cannot call it summary and have it's OK.",
            "I don't know.",
            "I don't know either.",
            "But right now two parts are fine.",
            "Maybe we don't even have to have two parts, I don't know.",
            "Yeah. Yeah.",
            "I think it's optional.",
            "Yeah. I, I agree to the first, first chapter but -",
            "Although, it, it would also make sense to part a part after the second chapter, before the third.",
            "Not after the third.",
            "And -",
            "Maybe I'm OK whith genuins parts all together.",
            "Yeah. Then we -",
            "Will you merge them PERSON17 or?",
            "No, I -",
            "Pages.",
            "Yeah, it's two pages each.",
            "I think we have enough. Enough pages anyway. Like the limit is - 50 is the minimum I guess or?",
            "I don't know. But now we have almost 150.",
            "Yeah, I think it's enough.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so two -",
            "Also like looking at the contents attentions and effective mechanism for word element and relations need to be sheltered.",
            "Yeah, this, this should be -",
            "Yeah. This, this is should be like the story right.",
            "Yeah, it's like the -",
            "Yeah, but it's not really - Yeah, the - The title isn't story about the content. It's not so I should the title.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, yeah, I don't know. Representing words.",
            "I think the name of the book is nice.",
            "Yeah, the book is, yeah. This is -",
            "OK, maybe we should. Word and. The first chapter, the first real chapter can be hidden in the, the embeddings.",
            "And hidden in the attentions. And then -",
            "And then in the context.",
            "Then in the context.",
            "I'm playing with hiding in my pages title.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think my chapter.",
            "OK. And do you think deep learning for the first, I would, maybe I would.",
            "Attention.",
            "Of the NLP.",
            "I thought so NLP.",
            "It, it is not on NLP. Yeah.",
            "I think it's fine. Deep learning. This. Should.",
            "OK, so I.",
            "Well, this is like the, the for chapters and these, these. Maybe it will be better if summary were somewhere there.",
            "It can be just here, yeah.",
            "But in the introduction we don't have it.",
            "And it's the same as -",
            "Yeah, it's the same as.",
            "I think the summary is usually not numbered.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, maybe, yeah. I don't -",
            "It's not really part of the text.",

            "We still didn't have PERSON11. I'm not sure if he will connect. I expect him to connect. So anyway let's get started. Thanks for coming. Again we are trying to record this call to see if we are able to summarize it automatically. Document we are talking about - So our probably - So the point of these meetings is that everybody very loudly says and enters in the list actually in the in the google sheet, that is more important, the number of items that you have worked on and that you think you deserve some. So that's the that's the point of the meetings. So that's list. So please make sure that your point from the last week already have a row and then when they have the row I can end the I can end that. So briefly describe all what you did what do you think deserve some because it is usefull for at the all of that. So it is a practise in selling your homework. And that aplies also to PERSON8, PERSON2 and PERSON7 of course. And everybody else who should also come later. So that's yeah - One thing that I want you to say loud is that I've agreed, I was asked by PERSON9 to give her presentation on PROJECT2 on the Monday seminar so as from subtitling we are also expecting to describe of what we are doing regular talk there. The date I think the date is possible the 17th February so in little bit more than two weeks from now. And the goal of office would be obviously to describe the pipeline say where there problems and to invite more people to join us. So that's why I pick this every day. So that's thats one modification for this. This is the early session that I'm of approach we need some domain adaptation again. So I need to work on this which is so this is a good place for better to use English as English models because I think that this english models could be better adapted. Also maybe PERSON11 can adapt the just the vocabulary of the PERSON7 talkage. So the standard as that we are using. But that would need input from people are not here. From PERSON6 and maybe PERSON1. So let's let's they the optional. So that is the early session for the adaptation. And then the other domain adaptation session that will need that will be a harsh one. So there will be then other Monday seminars. For these other Monday seminars we don't have to do anything it's just an opportunity to try it again. But one event will require that. And that is there is two upcoming events so actually event big for them maybe. So the Monday seminar on the 17th happens the week after we have some dry run of a workshop where we are describing various language technologies and that's for the ORGANIZATION5 congress the part like the site activity. We are not only subtitling but we are also advertising for NLP. And already wednesday of the 12th of February we are having our first dry run. And the idea is that we say there will be also recorded and used for domain adaptation later on. And the second dry run and then the final workshop. So there will be us non-native speakers very likely presenting in English. Because the workshop will be held in English. That would benefit from the same type of domain adaptation as we will need for the 17th of February. So there two events which have the same type of adaptation. It's NLP and PROJECT2 on the 12th and the 17th of February. So two weeks from now and a little bit later. And then the important big event that I wanted to talk about is the students firm fair thats something which we have done only last year. And last year nothing was really working. And we were only reusing the system from ORGANIZATION4 and it went for single minute of the two days. But it was an important event for data collection because students are presenting their companies and we record them and they transcribe it and they compete in how well their work their voice was recognized. And it's very noisy environment it's like fair or congress in big hall of many stands and there is little a little side It's not really room, it's just a dedicated area where this competition of the firm presentations is running. So it's a big challenge for equaliate. And we are also going to writers, well it will depend what the they will let us or not, last year we were we were showing some of the subtitles and because that was were appearing just once. But because there is four hundred high school students, they are able to take pictures of that and they were then sharing that across networks they were laughing at other teams. So it is it is an risky activity. And that's a big for us it's a big opportunity to test that. So that's the 18th and till 20th March and for that we would highly benefit from having some profanity filtering. So this is an invitation. This is one of the to do or wanted items to add some filter and f populated what words that we don't want to show at all. So it's it's not always only bad words it could be just words related to bad topics. So that's it is top so it's also the questions what to do of these topics then rather we should removes such words or not. But this is something that we have a months or more for. And we really should work on this. Some censorship upcoding construct. So as you remember on the day before yesterday were PERSON4 giving advering talk one LOCATION1 word which has nothing in relation that was translated as scrotum and so this is exactly the type of word which is bad for high school students. So - So that's an invitation for well domain adaptation because we don't know in part no in part but kind of - We may know the names of the companies at least and maybe some description live up what is their core bussiness or topic of business. And to that we should adapt because they going to present their companies. And It will be non-native speakers of English. So this is already like a big challenge. And then the filtering of the profanity would be would be are useful for that. So and I would like to ask everybody to say what they did and think about what activity they would like to work on. So maybe PERSON16 you can start.",
            "Okay. This week I work on do the collection is business for OTHER3 and English. And because the from the OTHER3 thing of the office I have downloaded 1970 to 1980 pdf files which is extracted which was extracted from the OTHER2 using texted OTHER1 so just can work in text format. And 15000 sentences is crawled automatic using automatic clover for English and OTHER3. From these supreme article this. So and we need I need clean all the data because some duplicate sentences and some other garbage values. So member PERSON6 is I think he was busy exams all times.",
            "Who?",
            "PERSON6.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "Sometime that United interrupted because - So this is the picture.",
            "OK, so what would be your collaboration with PERSON6 then if you if you were available?",
            "So we will - We will use it -",
            "He would use it as language model and he would extract the terms from that or?",
            "I don't know what he is using the tools what is the aplication so it would be nice when we would be -",
            "So I didn't catch the details, the numbers. Maybe later if you can correct that. But the first which is so far there were mostly in English or only in English or all the languages, that's a mix of languages?",
            "English and OTHER3.",
            "So only English and OTHER3.",
            "Little bit. Monolingualy.",
            "So for the English or for both of them these are languages anyway so there the adaptation by PERSON6 make sense it's good to put this into the collection and start organizing the collection. Ok, great, so thanks.",
            "So PERSON11 updated me yesterday. There was some problem of the -",
            "So I think I understood the problem from the comment. So if the idea is that the compress sound goes always to network and is directly decompress before begin sent. So have you added the required command?",
            "Yes I could interprate. It's there.",
            "So PERSON11 will test it whenever.",
            "So that's one thing, second thing. I was looking into that MultiSource model output PROJECT1. So I did some thing one that. But one specific question I had was regarding the profanity filtery and give after PERSON4. So let it circumstance we had that the that is not actually that is not supposed to be a prophane what coming up.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so but I believe in the putting up the top of list. Do you think I mean I don't think that briefly most effective thing because we would blocking on many. So better something I would like to aplain like a like to thinkable.",
            "So I have an idea but I don't know if we have the person for that and the idea is exactly responding to the to the fake that. The list will never be complete and it will contain many word which we actually like would like to have an as the output or as the input. So the idea is here the bad word was created by an error in the translation system. So somehow there was lighter the Czech word was \"šoupátko\" which is a slider actually and for some reason in some of the corpora this must have been in the same sentence as the error came from. So it just made up a follow low frequency pattern which was unreliable. So the idea I have in mind is to train empty systems on corpora which are refind to contain only higher frequency words so like safe word corpora or safe vocabulary corpora. Safe is not in the sense that it's not bad word but safe in the sense that it has enough occurancies. And I would like to - So this is if we do this type of filtering firstly together a very huge corpus then we need to set up threshold like what was the safe we can work frequent boundary and then we need to create the corpus which is somehow limited to these words. And that is hard, somewhat, but I think that we could do it monolingualy and use back translation to create the other part. And maybe put out sentences which are. There is two ways either we can brought sentences which contain infrequent word infrequent words or we can replace infrequent words in the sentences with some like placeholder things like forgetting. So then we use the rest of the sentence and non just these kept these unknow words. And the third option is to use this filtering on in the monolingual setting only and use backtranslation to get the other side. And we need to evaluate which of these approaches is the best interupt. So all preservation of quality and avoidance of bad words. So this is like a large topic and it's totaly unlagged to refiltering on the fly. One further twist in the on the fly furthering would be like to add words live and we go. So the tool that does this filtering should actually be regularly checking this has appearance some list. So then we can immediately prevent respond of them. Well in the TOK on Tuesday PERSON4 didn't say \"šoupátko\" again so the scrotum did not reappear. But still we would like to have a chance to prevent it from that. So that's a like a bigger experiment and I would probably find someone new for that one semestr stars from the students but it's it is an option. Okay. So yeah. So your main homework word compression, the further experiment in word multisource and just this comment on the limitation profanity filtering. Okay. Thank you. So now maybe PERSON17.",
            "So as you may know I finished evaluation framework and it's ready but maybe for some test maybe I should do some a small changes but I think it's ready. We approved that time base and word base segmentation to find the for example where is the may I want to calculated delay I should estimate that time of each word should be the time expected time for each word. So I used two different segmentation for this, one is timebase and second is wordbase anyway everything is almost ready. And now maybe I need something like complete files to test it to test our there framework. I prepare a small things myself manualy and it works now. So this is the team and now I me and PERSON10 working on the I and PERSON10 are working on the paper for exceptement and I think that's on. So -",
            "So the bad thing - PERSON2 is on the call. The bad thing is that I haven't heard from - A Okay. So there is four - I've received that e-mail yesterday from PERSON1. The MI Corporas the MI Corporas has time stamps for word. So we should be able to convert that. So the problematic setting. PERSON2? Are you on the call?",
            "Yes.",
            "So the remember that we have the recorded from MI Corporas where your forced alignment totaly fails. And we have the idea of breaking in a small chunks. So realize and then PERSON1 has double checked this corporas actually.",
            "Yeah I have already read a mail.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I think that it would still be interesting to run your forced alignment of this data and we you can now use the existing time stamps to break the long recording into shorter ones. So that you see whether it like cashes up with these shorter segments. And that is important to know for some future corpora what will not have the time stamps.",
            "Okay. I will looking to that.",
            "But for the evaluation we have now something that we can do we will actually sometime. It appears that thursday lunch time is the bad time. Last time it was also very noisy in this.",
            "Maybe we should do it after lunch or maybe in the morning.",
            "Yes. It's I don't know I don't know why it's a case normaly recorders it's much quieters.",
            "But the question corpus we had the English and LOCATION1 parts or only.",
            "So no, we have only one recordings translated into LOCATION1 and OTHER3.",
            "Okay, so it's a OTHER3 but we won't have do we have English is are we have -",
            "Yes. We have correct English transcript much large of volume and we have limited file only in LOCATION1.",
            "Okay, and the mode English it's time stamped.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "This is what something which I didn't realise before because I with that like intense enough myself.",
            "Yes. So in this case I can convert the second we can use it but we can discuss about it later.",
            "Yeah, okay. So to cut down, evaluation too is finished. Now, why do not -",
            "Yes, I have a question about this board files. Is there any trajectory to how have together?",
            "No we don't have that.",
            "Because unfortunately I'm not sure I have access to. Because I have access to some of them because it's a little bit - So maybe if we can have name of files. It could help someone somebody like me. Because I know we have lot of these files now.",
            "Create a list of them and then send.",
            "Maybe could help because I'm confused about this files I cannot find to use.",
            "So that's. And now let's move to those who are present remotly. So maybe PERSON7 if you can start? You understand at all?",
            "Yes, yes. I have been listening. So I have mainly concentrated on the adaptation of czech ASR for PERSON4 talk that took place yesterday. So I've experimented with various technics and especially like domain adaptation of a language model and then acoustic fine tuning on PERSON4 talk. So I think that I was quite happy with result then during the presentation as like quite a lot of domain specific words were recognized by the model. So that's good sign for me that some how works these technics and - Yes, right now I'm working on a next version of the czech ASR system that should be trained on even more data. So I'm preparing this.",
            "Ok, so remember the thing that I said at the beginning. Please enter your achievements also into the google sheets so that thing once for that. Whenever you think it something big and I think this the improvement PERSON4 talk it's very good one so definitely deserve to be listed. Please let's make sure you do that. Don't forget.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So now let's move to PERSON2.",
            "So first question regarding the compression. Which kind of compression it is. And It will be applied to all ASR systems?",
            "So that's something that we're just testing and PERSON11 said that he would evaluated. PERSON11 has found the appropriate command flacs so that the audio is compress to mp3 then shiped as mp3 to network and then decompress before being sent to the ASR. And the question is what effect does this have on the ASR quality. So if the if there is something we can lost of then we don't want to do it but if it's like the same then will write to because it simply makes the communication more abased less likely to be to be effected by network long. So PERSON11 will evaluated soon and he can evaluated with everything and because had already been integrated. And - So if your assistance - I belive could evaluated yourself as well supportly or if your assistance will be already included and delivered stable output which is the problem that we still have. Then PERSON11 would evaluated for you.",
            "Yeah. Jus. Because I noticed when I read the paper about Librispeech that the recordings were before in mp3 format and then they were actually converted into flac format and then I had to convert it into WAV format so and the and the common voice is also in mp3. So I guess that my systems are actually good with mp3 compression. So that's the first thing had. The second thing is I was working on the sound segmentation. It's there is a problem with ASR system because some words get cut in the middle. Now my systemlooks in the window with a greedy decoding and looks for pauses bef between words and I have window that must be at least four seconds long and maximum is eight seconds found find the most probable pause between the words and then I cut the windows there. So this makes the decoding a bit better. I also trained the transformer converting the phonings into graphians and I tested to the settings. But the results were at least for at least for some ORGANIZATION6 talks they were really bad because the corpora on which the transform were trade was trained is for casual speak and fairy tales and so on. So that's actual translation with the with the transformer was quite bad and the transform-hallucinated some words. It was funny laugh. And I sent an e-mail to PERSON13 and I haven't received any comments to this new segment to this new windowing from him. So -",
            "Sorry. So you have already integrated right? So anybody can tests it at this news.",
            "No, I had some temporary folder for this hot updates but I need some feedback from PERSON13 of how this works with his segmenter. And I will have some more recording from the from yesterday so we can use this non-native English for some find uniquals our models.",
            "Okay. So do you estimate that than your segmenter could be operational in the two weeks from now for the Monday talk by 17th or even for the dry run sesion of the workshop on the 12th and you can talk.",
            "I hope so but I haven't heard from PERSON13 yet. So I don't know wheter it works. And the next problem is that the segmentation should be done on speaker separately because when there is some conversation the windows can overlap to speakers and the problem is then the transformer translate these sentences into nonsense.",
            "The problem is that we don't have speaker diarization on fly so we simply do not know when there is a speaker change.",
            "Yeah that's a problem but if the talks are only with one speaker then there is no problem with this.",
            "So the talks in general are one speaker only but do it also as an for example for the remote calls there conference calls on the interview platform, there each speaker has different chanel so the diarization is there for free and it's not mixed.",
            "That sould be better and the next problem is that the windows overlaped sentences and this causes some problems too. And I now I don't have some now no solution to this problem.",
            "Yeah. So are you waiting for PERSON13 also please getting dash with PERSON11 because I think that PERSON11 made be more responsive these days. PERSON11 is coming back to back to LOCATION5 on the weekend. Who won't be available during the. Then may have more time for that.",
            "Good. I will have new better models by PERSON1 so maybe this will work.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you. So everybody please review what have in document I was trying to do something but I'm not perfect I can roll it follow. So the Last person we have here today is PERSON8. So I don't know if the rest of team has ever met you in person. Maybe not. PERSON8 has already worked on the project last june when he was helping us to put all the byplan together and - So I just remember that his reimplementation or his treak of the TEE programme TEE rescue the project because TEE was cashing its output. And we need the byplans to be wilow cashing so we created an modify version and there was there was one of the early sessions. And PERSON8 is now in LOCATION3. So he can participate only remotedly and there for also whatever he does has to be like self contain as little interaction with others as possible. So now PERSON8 please let us know what if you have work on anything. I think you work on paraphrasing. So you are in touch with some other colleagues from here who are actually today. But in the paraphrasing goal it's not for PROJECT2 that's for different that's for different project. So is there anything that you have work on it's useful for PROJECT2 from the subtitling.",
            "Yes, so far I have only worked on the paraphrasing and actually I just w I just wanted to say that right now I'm just waiting for a virtual machine for the paraphrasing server but otherwise it is done and working. Otherwise I was planning to work on to work on the division of the levels of microphone. I know is that still -",
            "It is still deleted.",
            "Okay, if it is still deleted then I can then I can started next week. But my first priority was the paraphrasi was the paraphrasing so I didn't didn't yet.",
            "So that the problem is that PERSON13 is not responding. I remember that I have asked him to check if the virtual machine set up is reasonable and something like that and then forward to the IT department. If you don't get any response from PERSON13 even after the weekend then please make sure to like treasure ask for that yourself without waiting.",
            "Okay, okay so I don't have anything interesting to report you right now.",
            "Yeah. The visualisation of sound it's something that we will need. This is something that PERSON11 would check. I think it should be simply and totaly independent process for now which anybody could run to adition to be sound acqusition pipeline and would that see which of the input chanell is receiving what output. So it's very similar to Audacity recording chanells except it is not recording.",
            "Yeah, okay. Ou, there is one thing that isn't exactly I don't know important maybe. But then I just saw it today. And I told you might be interested in it. I saw that there's any paper from ORGANIZATION3 from december on ASR and it is called FastSpeech. Have you have you seen it?",
            "I heard about it somewhere where have I saw it -",
            "Yeah, so I just try it today and it's just basicly sais that it's like three hundred times faster for ASR so it could I just told it could actually be used to do ASR like on the spot and it couldn't have to be sent and the delay problem could be eliminated.",
            "And they also say it is that it is robust and dust nearly eliminates words keeping which is also interesting so I can just send it to you if you like.",
            "Well the question is wheter it is available as code, it is? Is it?",
            "I haven't I haven't get didn't get try yet.",
            "So that in that case that would be obviously interesting so that we would try in our set up.",
            "Yeah, I.",
            "Fastspeech, yeah, it seems like it should. So again. I think I wanted. Check if there is code for that and integrate - So that's that's it. Thank you.",
            "Anyway I do my exams period is ending maybe I would be able to come to LOCATION5 for maybe one week or something like that.",
            "Yeah, okay. And a colleague of mine ask me wheter you are from LOCATION2 or not and I don't remember.",
            "No.",
            "Are you? Are you from Kos.",
            "No, I'm not, I'm from LOCATION4.",
            "LOCATION4 okay. Yeah, so that's different. So, I think that's we should stop again today it's then spent more time we wanted. Please review this list and please think what you to do from the wanted topics. So that next week we should be meeting at the same time, still thursday and - Okay, so what so you prefer friday instead of thursday right? So should we all then make do a call for a doodle because thing changed for others as well. Okay so.",
            "Bye. Thank you much.",
            "Bye.",

            "Okay. Okay. And the other think if now we have to really mobilize our efforts tools the proposals.",
            "Yes.",
            "Because you know late, The data deadline has already come now. It is November 30th.",
            "November 3rd?",
            "November 30th. Feasible. End of November.",
            "End of November, Okay.",
            "He guess. So we have to about the data about the even mission metrics. Tho these may change actually, But the proposal should look good with all the all the.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Like with all the components, You know.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I should be able to get back to all of you by the end of the week with the ORGANIZATION1 data set. Yeah, I think I think I can. I can lay.",
            "So you are now. So now you are active you are you are work in hard on ORGANIZATION1. Yes?",
            "Yes, yes, I think they if should get ready by the end of the week.",
            "We. Week ago you said that it should have been ready to by the end of the last week. So actually, actually kind of wait expected that today we will discuss the annotations and these alignment tool by PERSON6. So how it will this PERSON6.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I actually. I'm not really sure if we should not no. I don't mean that I do. Well. By the end of November should we get some new aligned data. By using PERSON6's tool. And already made by annotators. Do we it the end of November, Should we started now. And be really quick in giving to an? Really takes time before we start this annotators work. Should we started? What do you think?",
            "I'm not really sure about. Like this should be started. But I don't think that we can put that in the proposal. This can start.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'mmediately but for the for the fast shared task I'm not sure like we have clear or on the of using the alignment thing.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the PERSON2 like I late personally I would prefer the shared task to be as simple as possible, Because even the task is hard. That I have late available realized by now.",
            "So like if you the keep like keeping the major focus on the summarization part. Like to build summaries very close to how the are. Should be the main focus. And the in like this envisioned to lose the evolution metrics that we are going to propose. Should come in the second like not in the fast shared task. Because that will be like then we will mixing up too many things in one in one place.",
            "Well, I'm not sure if understand all the details.",
            "So I'm saying like little skip the fast shared task as simple as possibly. Like we have already some evaluation metrics like and other evaluation metrics that we have. Okay and we also have a manualy evaluation think that is prepared by PERSON3. And I think it's it's good that we can involve annotators to.",
            "But does has does have at least some minimal sense, Doesn't give some totaly unrealistic numbers that doesn't that don't say anything serious about the quality of the annotations.",
            "Says, but we are in a community.",
            "Yeah. It's it's for summarization the rules is that. You know like, yeah. I know like we that. But it's the.",
            "So actually, Why we want to run this PERSON6's tool is that has actually no real sense run estimating the summariz on the one hand, And on the other hand that manual metrix, manual evolutions that we have now are very subjective and kind of also very wake. And in these keys using the alignment could give us a little more than when at the community.",
            "Yesss. Yes.",
            "Probably if we don't put at in to the shared task, We kind of don't use.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We could you.",
            "It this investigation this desert should definitelly go in the background. For the alignment thing, Because this could be on new contribution from all in.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this should going the background. But like a convincing the convincing the reviews about the alignment tool.",
            "Yes, this.",
            "The proposal would be difficult so I would propose.",
            "Maybe.",
            "Yeah. I would propose, Yeah, so I would propose that before aaa like making the alignment to part of shared tasks datas get the people on exceptive somewhere. And maybe -",
            "Okay.",
            "The data set the alignment tool gated accepted by the community. And then we can refer that. Okay. This is on ready exceptive and so yeah. People can use this.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So. What they actually minutes that for the shared task get as go with the really conventional thing that people do for summarization. Take use rules. You some other evaluation metrics like some. Or like there were metrics late. Using word words distance and stops. So other than rules.",
            "Probab so I am eager so I actually want to prepared to relieve you. And I really trust for this questions. I not so experienced in then, But maybe you could also discussed it with PERSON4 once more. So it's in these aspect you are definitely are more experienced, And but please discussed it with PERSON4 before.",
            "Yy, yes. Yes, actually PERSON2, I was I was thinking too evaluate some meetings based on the based on the automatic evaluation metrics that we have. And then show to all of us. And then we can decide that which evaluation metrics we can we can for the shared task. Maybe.",
            "Could you try these metrics on the meeting on these meeting? On these set I'm not set we will evaluate make.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Oh, okay, okay. So but.",
            "So that we could get manual evalutions and also some automatic metrics, And then compare them.",
            "Yes, you are okay. So PERSON2, when do you need this till me. I will schedule accordingly. When do you need?",
            "Well, I don't really needed. I want to know what I do myself to be as so af so as effective as possible. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So you actually. So you are time limited. Probably.",
            "Hello?",
            "Yes, I'm thinking.",
            "So okay. So PERSON2 what you do is like want you have the minutes from all of your participants. Send me this. And maybe within a deal back with you all the evaluation metrics.",
            "Yes. Okay. But maybe in this case, if you have a clear understanding what should we prepare before the end of November, Tell me what should I do? What should I give you before this. Send email.",
            "Yes. So I what I we do now is maybe from tomorrow on works I will start writing like. I have already the components nearly. So it start drafting and then we will definitely come up with some gaps that we need to killer. Then I will be late I can I can see that what other things we require. But like the lotion is to keep as simplest as possibly. So whatever we have we do the fast shared task with those. And in the midway in the background we.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so yeah. If you say, that standpoint on my hand it's too like give you the bit give you all the ORGANIZATION1 data which should be ready, Because the minutes I have downloaded. The only thing that is too properly align with the properly align with the corresponding trasncripts. So I have to find way to do that. And also like prepare in the form like the basics sample form that you require. Right? As far the PROJECT1 meetings.",
            "No I'm totally lost.",
            "So I'm saying that for the you.",
            "Firts, so.",
            "For the ORGANIZATION1 data set, you need the data in the form like our PROJECT1 meetings. Right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so that is from my part. I have to do that.",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "And with to you finally data. Yeah.",
            "And what I. Yes, this from ORGANIZATION1 it's clear to me. What is not clear to me is what we do with the alignment of transcripts and minutes now. Did you already tried this PERSON6's tool, Did you think about how to organize this annotators work. Do we begin it now? Do we begin it next week after you already with ORGANIZATION1 corpus. Or don't or we don't begin it at all, Because as your seen it is not actuall for this shared task.",
            "No, PERSON2. I think we should begin. I think we should begin take the charge. Because I would be now fully focused till November 30th on the shared task proposal.",
            "But who? I can't, I can't. So you are the only person who understand how this PERSON6's tool wor functions. PERSON6 is not working for that. So I really need person, Who will really help me to begin work with annotators.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I think can because I think PERSON5 was also working on integrating something into the tool. And yeah she knows.",
            "Where is PERSON5 actually? She is not with us somehow, But I see her online.",
            "So.",
            "So you, you want to you want to transfer this task to PERSON5?",
            "Not exactly. I would say that I would do it once. And like once I'm done with the ORGANIZATION1 thing. And I believe proposal. Because.",
            "Yes, but that means after end of November.",
            "Yeah, maybe. Yeah.",
            "Because I actually I'm kind of waiting all the times, So I don't really understand. If I should stop waiting, So okay. Becau. So in this case either I wait to December. Or you transform this task to PERSON5. And explain her how to I don't know work with anno. So this is really I don't know at all how this technical part works.",
            "And PERSON3 indeed help with this task. I don't want how to begin. So I know how to in how to work within the tool, But if I send the link to the inc to this tol to my annotors. And they have some questions, And they will have some questions, definitely because this is written in Python, And Python mostly has problems when install in that tool. You also experienced such problems. And it. So. If the annotators come ups with questions, I would never able to answer. So I really need a person who would be by hand, So it would really help me all the time and in this.",
            "Yeah, so one thing that we need to be sure about the tool is like the tool is doing annotators like alignment. So but the thing is that once the once the annotator does the alignment, So what is the output of the tools. It should be some manual score or metric or what. So that I think you need some discussion.",
            "Why metric? This is just a alignment, just which part of what. So you mean how it is can be useful for evaluation. But this is another question yes, But this is not before that. We sh. Yes, this is important question. But this is not just for that.",
            "Yeah, once we do the alignment, Understand. Okay. Then I will tool is doing alignment, So how going to use the alignment. So that question also let should coming early.",
            "So you should think it's come it should come immediately at the same time?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. From.",
            "No, we able outcome from the tools.",
            "We need a idea how to use it.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Suppose we use the alignment. And then we don't know how to use that.",
            "No.",
            "So yes, for example, if you see that Jens that minutes fix just smaller part of the transcript. Or then so then they get less as smaller number of kind of in these evaluation. This is what we discussed with PERSON4 once, And I objection to that because it is not so evident. So his idea was that say for example, If there is if the crossling between transkript and minutes is smaller than the quality of the minutes is also worse. But it from my opinion it should not be always the case. Oh, because it could also be that some pieces of transcripts are unimportant or on the contrary. So it's not so straightforward. At this moment I don't have any clear answer to your question. And I also understand that it should be. It should be stated clearly, But I me and PERSON4 have kind of strong intuition that it could help by evaluating.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, that is that is very much clear, That if we definitely help for the evaluation, Because oh yeah what you think in machine translation this alignment tool or alignment metric is like very helps. Similar I think go for summarization when we see that models very good. Which is eventually alignment. But the thing is like once we give this thing to our annotators. I would really want to see that some tangible things come. So once the alignment this done then mix work.",
            "Okay.",
            "One we.",
            "Okay, What tangible thing could be that and the result you can't you get. Align of summary. And a piece of transcript. So kind of a structured transkript into pieces where one line of summary corresponds to a piece of transcripts. So you don't have a very long transcript. And very long and very big minutes. But you really have a summarization office small piece of text. So it could be so the text could be divided according of that, And that data in this are kind of March and Margaret in this way. So this is one of outputs. Do you get. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?",
            "Yeah, I've I've got it. So you mean to say that we have aligned minute and transcript? And that is the that is the current output. And then we think that how to leverage on that.",
            "No, no, no. No. I just saying that this is already a good advantage to have smaller pieces of transcripts, and a correspondent summary line. So we have other type of data somehow, That not just big one hour long transcripts, And long too pages long minutes. But we also get the output like ten lines of transcript. And one line of minute. So enlarge so the datas different qualitatively different data set. Very have many, many pieces of transcripts. And many, many corresponding lines of summary. So it could be kind also ano good training data. Better.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm saying it clear enough.",
            "Yeah, okay. So what PERSON2, I absolutely support you that we should start the this alignment thing with our annotators. Soon. But I'm I'm not sure that if we should include that evaluation part as part of shared task. Because there are still many questions unanswered.",
            "How are do we going to.",
            "Yes, okay. I've got what you said. And now I'm still wondering will work on that and when. So really kind of administrative have this administrative problem, Because I want to. And I don't know how technical. Because the tool is actually ready. But there is some connection is missing that. Somebody should say how to download the meeting, What to click to make it work, And where to put the data.",
            "Okay. Okay, yeah. I can I can.",
            "If you want to transfer it if you want to transfer it to PERSON5 maybe it would be also possible. Please then go PERSON5 and you to just agree who is doing that. And agree on the details. I think it.",
            "I'm here.",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "I was listening to you all the time, So you said.",
            "Really? I didn't hear aha now I seen see you, Because I just looked at them for some minutes ago, I didn't see you, That's why I was writing you.",
            "Yeah, I joined there was a network problem.",
            "By teh way these time one instead of to. We started an hour earlier than normally today.",
            "No is it?",
            "Yes, we had a.",
            "Well, it is actually okay and I don't I don't mind it we started one, But now we have one. One.",
            "Okay. Yeah I think I can work to I can work on that. But I think I'm a bit too much like worried about the proposal. And also that like to create the data set before like we to have a good data of the ORGANIZATION1 thing to be release just part of the shared task. So I don't if PERSON5 will be comfortable to do that. Or otherwise eventually I can do that, But maybe I will require some more time.",
            "Are you talking about the ORGANIZATION1 corpus creation?",
            "No.",
            "No, no, no.",
            "PERSON6's alignment toll and starting align transript summarize.",
            "Yeah. So I'm comfortable with it. If you want to transfer it's okay with me.",
            "Yeah, If you if you want to start you can. Maybe I will join you within a week once this things are very sorted out.",
            "But may I ask PERSON5 and Thirtankar if you could just join to you to together. And discr and discuss the technical details. And how we how the work could be started. Say till I don't know. Thursday. Friday. So that we could already speak about on Friday and started on Monday.",
            "So you are looking forward the start for the annotators to do the annotations from Monday on worse. Next Monday on worse, okay?",
            "Are I'm looking forward to started from this from September, Because I think we have a lot of data. And I'm so I'm still waiting on terms for creating kind of double summarize for meetings that are already minuted. And I am afraid we they will annotators will be away, Because they start finish before they make alignment. So I would be very glad to make the task the anno ask the annotators to make the alignment. I'm sure if we will have enough money next year for example. So it's really important. It's a big very big work this alignment it really take a lot of time.",
            "130 minutes for English. And 110 minutes for Czech. It's really very, very big work. And to be started as soon as possible.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so, and annotating PERSON2 I would one to mention like before giving the minutes to the annotators we must be sure that which transkripts or minutes really part of the data set, Because some of them.",
            "Yes.",
            "Has.",
            "Yes. I think about it. I think about that, And probably excludes some meetings, And some other meetings. And I will definitely start with imaging center of the shore.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON2 what exactly do you want as one from us like to start the annotation work, because I think we should do it as soon as possible, Because it will it is going to get a lot of time.",
            "PERSON1 knows that. Because he spoke with. And he will explain you what to do. And after you the topic, We will discuss it on Friday. And then I expect that you will say me, What should I say to annotators. So. What I just try to my annotator know you will do the alignment of this and this, You find guidelines on this link. This are these are the guidelines that we already.",

            "Okay, yeah, yeah.",
            "He was just curious. Tell me.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON3 has sent the Overleaf, well one Overleaf link, and also the link to the GitHub prepositary where we have the template is normal directory. And I'm now trying to fix the program in Overleaf. You were also looking at the Overleaf, right? Yes,",
            "Yes.",
            "I and I guess it also doesn't compile for you.",
            "Exactly.",
            "So I'll try to figure out what's wrong here, because it's, it works kind of on my machine. So I'll first disable Cleveref that's one auction. I tried disabling Cleveref which should release lead to some new errors. But the question is whether you can also, whether you are happy to work like without the Overleaf interface with this, i guess it is it should be not a big problem for you.",
            "No it's not, for us the main scoop of this meeting, should be to define a kind of structure of the deliverable documents.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "At the first sight. I was I. I was wrong. But actually, I intended that the documents should be only on the presentation platform, because they are publishing platform. But actually, then please confirm me. We have to put them also the ORGANIZATION1 presentation platform, and the ORGANIZATION7 presentation platform, in the documents.",
            "I'm not sure about the ORGANIZATION7 presentation platform. But I'm sure that we do want to include our platform there.",
            "Okay.",
            "And so I'm, I'm sure. So PERSON3 wha what the heck, which file has PERSON3 chosen as the as the source. As the source thing to test this. I'm trying now to fix the, so that we can directly use the Overleaf.",
            "Okay, nice.",
            "That would be good if it if it actually worked, so the reload. I'm not sure if it will work or not. Not connected? The only thing that I can do is, and it's the it's, the Overleaf is somehow strange. So we can for now, we can use it as a plain text editor.",
            "No problem.",
            "So if you can scroll, to where I am, yep, so executive summary. Page break yeah. This, if you can click on my, in Overleaf, if you click on my icon.",
            "Okay.",
            "Next to me, AB review button then, yes, yes,",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, so this is this is a sharespace, this is the sharespace that we can use to, to discuss the structure.",
            "Perfect.",
            "So the. So the deliverable sumarizes presentation platforms of live, transcript.",
            "Yeah don't worry to do that.",
            "It doesn't even type. Yeah, okay. So there is, I think that Overleaf has some serious troubles. Trancsript, translations, yeah. So let's use simple item, so there will be ORGANIZATION2 subtitle like platform.",
            "Yeah, so that's a, that's a good question about the ORGANIZATION7 presentation. Let's look at the deliverable. It's too bad, that I. One, two, three, four just joined. But it's probably doesn't work for him.",
            "Hi.",
            "Sorry. It works from this one, two, three four, it's me from the phone.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "Connect from the laptop, but I already was in this you know application, so I wonder what the problem is, sorry for that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No problem.",
            "You made it. So we are now in the Overleaf, which PERSON3 has sent the URL for. So if you check you email.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And there is this Overleaf link. And in says it doesn't compile. And actually it is called still D00 deliverable template. Let's not bother with that. Let's simply use it as, like, use it as our deliverable, and then we will, once we get it compiling we will make it again the template. So please open that link anyway. And we can, what we can do, share. No, we don't have the permissions. So, maybe this.",
            "I have for our four zero four error in web page.",
            "Do you see the chat, do you see the chat window? Try the link in the chat window.",
            "Where is the chat window? Yeah, okay.",
            "Yeah, okay, great, so then if you click on our icons, either mine or PERSON5's. You will also get your cursor next to the us, it's on the top AB review, and next to that there is, there is.",
            "Yeah, I see.",
            "Yeah, so click. Now you see where we are. So we can discuss the structure of this deliverable, and you already know the ORGANIZATION4 demo paper, so definitely please read that, and I think, so it is important to describe not only the end users like what the user sees, but also to describe the internals in some way. So like what is behind the scenes. I know that ORGANIZATION2 probably doesn't want to disclose some of these things. We probably do not mind that much if we disclose more on our implementation. So, yeah, please just, it's important to see what we have done.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Well, I just asked the about the possibility to share internals, and it shouldn't be a problem we should. We can do it. Of course.",
            "Okay.",
            "Arrange the meaningfully information to be shared. But of course, in the scope of the project and descended it's important to explain why it works.",
            "Yeah, so, so that's an important thing, this deliverable is going to be I'm scrolling, well it doesn't say so, but we need to follow, the requirements in the description of work and the D platform updates, the six, is it publishing platform it's called demonstrator. And it's for public, so this publishing platform deliverable, this text will be public. Which will be publicly available on the PROJECT1 website.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So that's, yeah. So these six one existing. Web based publishing platform be developed, so if you are looking I'll copy that. So this is the description of what we are going to be checked against. From. It is says there is this task, it doesn't work. Yeah. There is this task. And then there is this deliverable. So in the says that the ORGANIZATION7 platform, needs to be included.",
            "In fact.",
            "In fact, yes. So please talk to, it should not be too difficult for ORGANIZATION7 either, because they need one screenshot, which was already available in some preliminary version for the review, review meeting, if you remember, if you still have the slides.",
            "Yes.",
            "Then there was this screenshot, and that with some description should be sufficient. And so this ORGANIZATION7. What is that live transcript tab. Screenshot and description.",
            "Who is our intermediator with ORGANIZATION7, I should talk with.",
            "That's always difficult. And PERSON2 is the one who knows most. So that's.",
            "Okay, I will email all of them.",
            "Yeah, please email all of them and say, and please tell them that actually, we are quite late with the preparation. Because it has to be internally reviewed and normally we give ourselves two weeks, which is today. So, and we probably don't have anyone to, anyone who would've volunteered to review this. I'm checking in the continuous reporting. Publishing platform, it is jumping too much. Yeah, we don't have anyone to revi, yeah, so I'll push you PERSON5, I'm now looking at the ORGANIZATION3 sheet, I'll again paste the link so that you can easily get it to the chat window. So this the continuous reporting ORGANIZATION3 sheet. And, in the ORGANIZATION3 sheet I'll put, the link to the source which is here. And then I'll put PERSON5 as the main. PERSON5. As the main person. And then we need the reviewer. So, who could we ask, it ideally someone from ORGANIZATION6. Or someone from ORGANIZATION5, so I'll email those. And I'll tell them, so the, when could you two have it, because you two are, you two are providing most of the content, and the more important content, the ORGANIZATION7 won't tell any details anyway.",
            "Well, I have a of course i have several internal documents describing, for example, the architecture, the function analyses. And so on, I was just to arrange something in order to summarize. Informations, I will spend the today afternoon.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Preparing, I will be really happy if overleaf documents start compiling but it's not problem.",
            "Yes. Yes, Yep. Yep.",
            "Problem, for us is important. But, I think that it's important to have a kind of the same structure for all three platforms. To say that, yes, we are working.",
            "On all of those.",
            "Simply check. And, but I will spend the afternoon putting the info inside, and also on Monday, well actually we are really to them, deliverables, so don't worry. We will do it as fast as possible. We are also preparing trying to prepare at least, the ORGANIZATION4 paper.",
            "And the progress to the template. Not ORGANIZATION, EAMT.",
            "Yes, sorry the ELG document.",
            "So there is yes, there were too many things to discuss at once. I think that, so well, what was the documents. I think there was EAMT demo paper. That was one thing.",
            "Um-hum. The, it was the ELG the one suggested from ORGANIZATION6. The workshop.",
            "Yeah, the workshop at.",
            "Yes, we are working, trying to figure something goes for these kinds of publication, and we will ask your feedback next week for sure.",
            "Um-hum, okay. I'm trying to locate the details of that. So. And there is, that's what PERSON4 said, so EAMT, February 21. That's the ELG we should submit, so that's the thing. Yep, so that deadline is very soon. The deadline is, we have just a week. I don't think it would be a problem.",
            "Is optional at least, the deliverable instead not.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I think that the ideally, we should have our full content ready by Wednesday. PERSON1, is that also feasible for you?",
            "Yeah, I think so.",
            "So that would get us like two days to, so we could reuse that for the for the paper for ELG and PERSON1 you were not on the not on the call. So I'll add you.",
            "Which call?",
            "On that was discussed on the PROJECT1 call, so I'm and remote call the standard consortium wide thing. So I've just emailed you, I've assigned it to you its a ORGANIZATION3 assigment in a ORGANIZATION3 doc. And it has links to, those menus, not links sometimes not links sometimes only descriptions. Ok, so we should ask PERSON4 and PERSON8, and, yeah, I'm emailing colleagues in ORGANIZATION6, and ORGANIZATION5 who of them could review the deliverable. And I'll ask them, if they could do it towards the end of next week. With the hope that you will have that the content ready. And I think its definitely feasible for PERSON5. And its also will very likely feasible for PERSON1, because you already have some of the documentation ready. And it doesn't have to be like for, documentation.",
            "How long do you expect the whole document to be.",
            "I think two pages could be enough, because it's primarily a demonstrator and not the report.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "So, this is like a cover letter in way, so it should definitely.",
            "We will also avoid world functional analysis because, you know, it is really verbous. And it doesn't provide that much.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We need functionalities to be provided, and next paragraph for example the architecture, how the information flow works. And we collected to the mediator or it's not interesting. It's interested. Maybe.",
            "I think it is interesting. I think it's interesting the way it's connected. It's also for us as piece of documentation. So. In that case such a document would be useful.",
            "Okay. And maybe some notes regarding the user interface. We will lose interface, because people see. And we already have it, and that's it. Maybe some picture. Well, something that exist and it's working. Pictures are fine, also to prove that it's, it's something that exist and it's not only written on documentation. Okay.",
            "Yeah. So I'm writing the requests for yours, and the is six one. We need the internal review, the link will the. The content should be there towards the end of the next week. I will be mostly offline, that's a slight complication. Offline, and during the last week of February. Could anyone from you please. Oh, it was too early. We would like to the ELG paper from that and the ELG paper is due next Friday, Feb 21. Okay? So I think that, I will. I don't think that there is anything that we need to discuss at the moment, because we have the document. It doesn't compile. I should work on that to fix that compilation, but you can work on the plain text content already, and it compiles outside of Overleaf. So if you, if you for PERSON1.",
            "Have you ever worked of Overleaf outside of Overleaf?",
            "I mean like, but not with Overleaf.",
            "Yeah, so, but you are looking at the link, so you can click the Menu button which is on the left, at the top left corner. And there is in the in the menu. There is Dropbox and there is Git and you click Git, and it will give you Git clone command. You will use your normal Overleaf credentials, so please click it and double check that you can clone it.",
            "I don't have, i just use the ORGANIZATION3 credentials. So.",
            "Okay, probably that will work as well. I have no idea. No that's strange, I don't know how that'll work. Maybe that's a problem, because I remember that PERSON6 has a problem with cloning. He doesn't, he cannot really, really clone it. So, try cloning yourself and PERSON5 the cloning does work for you or not? Or you have not tried.",
            "I, missed the word the clone button is. Sorry.",
            "Yeah. So there it's, there is the menu, there is the menu, top left corner while you are in Overleaf.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Are you in Overleaf?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "There is the menu button. And then there is a sync with Dropbox, Git or whatever. So try Git.",
            "Ok you can clone them.",
            "And then, and it will give you the command Git clone. So please try if it really works for you or not.",
            "You will need to create special password for Overleaf, but then it probably should work.",
            "Ok, so if you create special.",
            "Okay, username and password should. Sorry, I have to check with credentials.",
            "I'll play with it, I'll create my credentials.",
            "So the short message is that if you clone it. It works. So I dunno why, if you clone it and there is even a make file. So you just type make, and it, it will compile. I don't know why it's fading here.",
            "Ok, thanks.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so PERSON5, do you have any questions concerning what should be in the deliverable. What is the necessary content.",
            "Well, proceed just important to have for each part the same structure at least so that, the functional main functionals. The architecture with the workflow.",
            "Um-hum. Yeah.",
            "User interface with maybe some picture. I think that a couple of pages could be fulfilled easily, with those information. Maybe a graph describing the workflow or something.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The rest is fine, definitely.",
            "Yeah, okay. So please, this structure down to that Overleaf document. So just use the screenshot, which is in the review slides and a paragraph where you describe, what do you know how it behaves.",
            "May i propose you to, directly use the second strategy. And ask ORGANIZATION7 to review my, my understanding of the platform. Okay.",
            "So you are suggesting that you'll write it right away. And then, you will know, okay, yes.",
            "Fix and so on.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So if you if you do that, that would be even better.",
            "Yep. No problem.",
            "Ok, great.",
            "In any case I will mail you today, don't worry.",
            "Yeah, them, them, they need toknow that's. And PERSON1 please follow the structure that PERSON5 well, have suggested in that Overleaf. So have separate section on that and provide again some screenshots, screenshots are already in the ORGANIZATION4 demo paper. So your platform is describe to some extenting in the demo paper. So maybe you to simply need to copy paste it on that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Where I, there is probably a link in the email for the original of the ORGANIZATION4 paper, right?",
            "I'll, I can share it as well.",
            "I know you cloned the.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "File so I can try making it.",
            "Yeah, turn demo paper.",
            "Error, failed.",
            "Okay.",
            "Recipe for deliverable failed.",
            "Um-hum, well that's bit tech but the PDF got created, didn't it?",
            "Let me check, there is one, okay.",
            "I think that it's because there is no references. So that's a problem, that it's. So the ORGANIZATION4 demo paper is now linked also from that Overleaf document.",
            "Yeah, it's the logo.",
            "I'll modify the make file as long as you don't have any references, I'll simply avoid Bibtexing them. Yeah, and now it's, now it compiles seamlessly, and I'll do one more thing. So make filed, this is zero two as six one. Make Git at the six one preview makes. And if you want to commit, which is important and to do properly, and then type of make space CI and have a look at the goal in the make file, because the commit actually. First involve some pull push dents with Overleaf Git. So if people are editing, it will become impossible for you to commit your work, because pull and push, they will always have some change. So you have to for actual pushing of your changes. If people are editing in the same time you have to wait. And push it on later. So now it like compile seamlessly for me,",
            "Yeah, I see, sorry, I actually looking at the paper.",
            "Ok so PERSON5, if that's all, let's, I'll disconnect, maybe you want to discuss something more with PERSON1 or not, but I'll disconnect and I'll try quickly debugging that's editing.",
            "I've just couple of questions regarding the make and compiler. But we can discuss about the to me the PERSON1. PERSON1, it works for you?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Nice, okay.",
            "Sorry, so you mean.",
            "Thank you PERSON7.",
            "Okay thank you, thanks.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Hi PERSON5, this is PERSON1, i'm actually PERSON7's colleague from you know back like 13 years, actually remember me and him taking some lecture. Thats probably 2000 or something. So now, I joined his team. Just the, you know, part time collaboration to keep.",
            "Nice to meet you.",
            "Nice to meet you too. So what was your question about to were you in the like local copy or.",
            "Yep, I cloned the Git repo, I've just pulled all the last modifications. In order to, I missed the part regarding the, how to commit, how to compile it. I've just tried a make.",
            "Do you start doing something?",
            "Yeah. But it task me about regarding the documents name. And I probably put it the wrong thing. How do, how should I compile it?",
            "Do you have, or something?",
            "Actually I do not right, directly on my workstation, but it should be installed hopefully. So first thing okay, if I haven't things installed, I have to install them, okay nice. And after that?",
            "I just typed make. And it probably has. Actually since it started teching, would it doing the internally.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Internally recording the Git command. I'm just looking into what it should be making Git commit from Git stash, Git pull. That's fine. That's kind of understood to get the latest changes first. And then he push it.",
            "Well, on my side. It worries about the fact that last page .style, doesn't take. But then it prompts me for a file name.",
            "Last page, ok so. It's probably a package that's missing. So the files the tech file, taking requires this use package require package.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it's like, you don't have it. You don't have in installed. So if I remember it some time back. So you might need some package manager. Which it's quite time when I use it. So I don't know how that's actually done.",
            "Oh, don't worry, I also do not remember my manager, which one is, but just give me one second.",
            "Or is it maybe just up to get something. No. Its TLMGR. They are like Tex Live manager. TLMGR.",
            "No.",
            "Or I'm just looking into, something on the Internet. Wikibooks. Packages. And it says the. So you'll probably have to figure it out somehow. It's either the standard packages that you have or this Tex Live manager.",
            "Is just a PVS maker.",
            "Yeah, it's the maker of the PDF. But how could you find it, find out. So you. If you type TLMGR, does it do anything for you? Do you have it installed?",
            "TL no.",
            "Okay, so you have some other distribution.",
            "Don't worry. I will check it by myself.",
            "And do you also say, you can say, you can say the B T. You get for the distant for you.",
            "I will work on, exactly.",
            "And then they say insert package name. Just simply. But the package names are called the tex live dash. So which one did you miss? Was it which style file did you miss?",
            "Last page.",
            "So if you say the YAM install tex live dash last page or something. Or last page. I would try these.",
            "I'm, I'm trying.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Well of course is start. Updating all the. Well, let's. It's updating.",
            "I'm just sending in the conference chat, I'm just sending the, the link to the Wikibooks what I've just saw. I dunno if it works or not. But.",
            "It found it, nice. You may install. Well sudo. Okay it's finishing the install phase. Okay. I re-run make. It still worries about last page .style. Or enter new name, that's why.",
            "No, it would, no it won't work. It won't work, you need to kill it. Just either control C or control R.",
            "Yep, yep.",
            "Because, you know, it's kinda tells you, if you if you have a different package to load instead of it. But that's not right.",
            "Okay.",
            "I am actually trying to find. Paragraph view text. So I'll copy it over right to the document.",
            "Okay, nice. I am, well still the wrong package, that why it doesn't, doesn't found it. Okay.",
            "So now, yeah.",
            "Okay, let's make okay. It complains on different styling but. I understood the pattern, I'm going to install it. Yeah.",
            "It's quite, convinient I mean this Overleaf. It's really.",
            "Yeah definitely.",
            "It's like very well done. Doesn't let me in for the Overleaf. For the other paper.",
            "Yes, I'm keeping stoling dependencies. I think the problem we are going to be kick of the from the, the room, because usually, it lasts just one hour. And then. Yeah. Yeah.",
            "Okay, at some point. I will finish installing the dependencies.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In order to, well Overleaf will work as Git repost, that I can commit my modification and pull your modifications locally. Okay. I can do it. I will check the make file for the, the target names. In order to make the correct command.",
            "It maybe even, it's actually it's it's working so maybe easier to working online, so maybe it's easier to without, without that.",
            "Oh yes, it's finally worked for me too. Nice. Okay. Thank you so much.",
            "No. So you see those version and the screenshots in a while, I'll just finish it and then I probably work on it like over night or something, but I guess. I will put in some more details. Technical ones, and when it's like, enough content. A note if you think I should modify something, I actually don't feel like I should be the final one to dictate what's in there. So if you feel like, you know.",
            "I think that, that probably you will write something much better that what I can able to provide to this document, so don't worry.",
            "We will see.",
            "Thank you so much for your work.",
            "Yeah as well, thank you very much and hear from you later. Okay. Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Now I'm recording already. Fin, aha I can see that. And maybe I'll ask you before anybody else is connecting, How is it – how does it work with the link? Do you create a next different link every time with – have a meeting?",
            "No, no, this is the same link you can find in the – If you have accepted that meeting invite, it is the same link.",
            "So that's –",
            "Meetings only.",
            "Yes. So this ORGANIZATION2 link will also – will also function the next time we have the coffee meeting.",
            "Yea, yea, yea. It is the – it is the rolling ORGANIZATION2 link, We can use it like for – for all of our meetings, so –",
            "Yes, okay, nice.",
            "For all our coffee meetings.",
            "Perfect, I just –",
            "So I'll also put – I'll also put the ORGANIZATION2 link as well as the ORGANIZATION2 link, so is suitable for us. We can. So in the same – same meeting invite you can find links.",
            "Okay. Thank you, thank you.",
            "Okay.",
            "And now let's wait before PERSON4 or – and PERSON2 are connecting.",
            "Said that he had another meeting before a. So from Doodle so – so – th an hour before – before that. Maybe he didn't finish yet, I'm not sure.",
            "Okay. So, PERSON7, so let discuss some things, okay?",
            "So, I – I wanted to note that – So, I didn't know – It was like – I don't think there is there is the – everything I clean manually corrected transcript as well as. Is that correct?",
            "So our output is manually corrected minutes and manually corrected transcript. Is that what you asked?",
            "I – I – I want to know that how do you have? Like, how do the.",
            "Okay. Did you see the document Minuting annotation guidelines? Probably –",
            "Yes.",
            "If I – If we look at it together and I will just detailise some things that you want to know – So, I will send you a link to minutes annotation, so that you can open it now.",
            "Okay.",
            "Do we have some chat here? Yes.",
            "Maybe you can send it to the hangnote.",
            "I have already sent it by chat, but I also can sent it by hangnotes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Is right that ORGANIZATION2 is not working for. How is it possible?",
            "Oh, yeah, how is it possible?",
            "So how is it possible that some link is working and another doesn't?",
            "I don't know. But ORGANIZATION2 is like, you know, much bigger than ORGANIZATION2 meet.",
            "I also think –",
            "And we have problems.",
            "And especially I can hear much better with ORGANIZATION2 than with ORGANIZATION2 meet.",
            "Right, right, exactly.",
            "One more thing is – is that they want to make it – So that – so we sh we have to pay for it beginning till next month or so.",
            "Oh?",
            "ORGANIZATION2 meet. It's not going to be free any more.",
            "Oh, it is already free for one hour.",
            "Yes.",
            "But more then one hour you have to pay.",
            "Oh, one hour, okay. It's not actually, okay. So –",
            "But ORGANIZATION2 meet is also free for fourty minutes, but I want to PERSON7, how like PERSON6 like be have got like the paid for ORGANIZATION2. Because PERSON6 seems that ORGANIZATION2 meeting link, it is obvious the – like.",
            "We have the paid version of ORGANIZATION2 for our faculty. But –",
            "Oh –",
            "There are some ORGANIZATION2s that we prepaid, but I'm not sure if it's a good option for lo for our coffee meetings. Because that's kind of for everybody and if we have not cross with other – with other courses that are going on – at our faculty.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "You really have to follow if nobody else is – s needs this hour for their teaching, So it's better to have something outside.",
            "So PERSON7, could you – could you respond to, like if he can reensolve ORGANIZATION2 and then join, because in ORGANIZATION2 meet it is really difficult to hear.",
            "Okay. Well, so, what we – we begin this data collection. I will try to make a very short presentation how I do that. So, we have automatic speech reconstruction transcripts. So we have transcripts with really bad automatic quality, which I send to the annotator and ask him to correct the data. And I also send him the audio file or video file via FileSender. This is some service of our university that I can send big attachements. I send a big attachement via some server and link to it, And in the attachement of the e-mail i send him the pre-processed automatic speech reconstructed – speech reconstruction transcript. So this is the stage one, transcript annotation, and he listens to the audio and corrects the transcript. After that he writes from stretch the minutes and send them to me. This is –",
            "Hold on. So when you send that – So what the annotator does is that he or she listens to the audio, and also goes to the automatic speech – speech transcript.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then? He or she corrects that?",
            "Yes.",
            "Also based on how they understand it? Am I right?",
            "He creates the minutes, yes. Mostly I –",
            "Okay.",
            "Not to give them the original minutes. So if they really ask for that, I can – I sometimes send them just for – Once they look like, but mostly –",
            "But. What is the original minutes?",
            "This is just what PERSON6 created duri. The agenda for the minutes.",
            "So this is the – like – by the participant, great.",
            "Yes. This is mostly – it – this is what was created by PERSON6 within our PROJECT1 minutes – PROJECT1 meetings.",
            "So there are – If you look at the data, there are a lot of docs there and data copy pasted from ORGANIZATION2 documents. And the documents contain original agenda of the meeting, which was created by PERSON6 or PERSON3 before the meeting and partially s extended during the meetings, or sometimes after the meeting. But this is kind of work version of what really was.",
            "Okay, so I would like to ask you now – So, by this original meetings, what PERSON6 and PERSON3 has created, so it is just for reference of the annotators. So –",
            "This is just for what? Sorry, once more please.",
            "This is just for the reference of the annotators. Do you think it has any practical significance to our – our or media task?",
            "I think it has, it may have. It's not – So this is also the output. Doesn't have the full representation as needed yet, but it can be changed to this presentation and it also reflects the essence of the meeting. So I cannot actually say that they are worse that the minutes created by annotators. It is actually a questions, because there are some drawbacks of those originnal minutes, because they do not contain some information or they may contain something that was not discussed during the meeting. But on the other hand they are rea, so they contain real names and they don't have errors in – in the content. So actually they're not worse. We can put them together with other – with transcripts and get more, just get more –",
            "So, not all the meetings has the original minutes, right?",
            "Yes, we try to get original minutes from the minu meeting organisers, but sometimes it may be very short for example, for – Some group of meetings, for example for PROJECT2, the minutes are very short and they contain just one line PROJECT2 book. And they discuss the book, not detailise it anymore.",
            "Okay. Okay, so, so ask line is good. So, you send this via file sender, and they you back the manually corrected ASR? And the minute for, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "And I put in – I put it to the server.",
            "You put it. So now, how did it work? So did the teams directions? Now how did it work.",
            "Now it works the same, we din't – we didn't change it yet. But after we change it – So we didn't change anything yet, so actually, probably you have to change it.",
            "No. I want to say that support after the team watch them, where from today look the. Today we look into the server, or should I have to be in touch with the annotator?",
            "This is the question we discussed today in the morning. So PERSON6 proposes that annotators do that themselves. We proposed that they will send the data to us. So I still kind of – So at the moment I do not have any idea hw to technically work with the variant that annotators send the data via GateHub. PERSON6 – PERSON6 is very much for that so that we really do that GateHub team and they can push and pull the data to the GateHub. But at the moment I'm not ready to say how it should be organised, because I have to give them tasks s. I have to say them'Now you write this and that – this meeting ', I have to correct it, so I have to look if their transcript and the minutes are okay. I have to provide – provide them with the audio and video file, And this is an extra action that should be done apart from GateHub, because it is a hard file.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sorry to interupt you PERSON7, I think that PERSON6 already decided not to include – not to let them Yes. work with GeteHub, because it deleted the – the team. It deleted the team.",
            "Yes, but after –",
            "But I think we – I think we agreed that they will keep communicating with you in the same way and that will manage log it up –",
            "Well, well –",
            "What you will –",
            "PERSON2, not really, because afterwards, after that meeting, he said me many times h that he still sees that it should be maybe changed. So maybe not today but he still sees the option better that this teams would be created again.",
            "Okay, so then we need another meeting I guess. Then we need another meeting with PERSON6.",
            "Not too long, but he s kind of – We spoke about that GateHub for a while after tha afterwards.",
            "Okay.",
            "He – wha he didn't try to persuade me to made these teams, but in his vision this teams still figurated somehow.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "Probably we should –",
            "So, PERSON7 –",
            "Not exclude this option for the moment, but –",
            "Okay, so, PERSON7, I – yeah I – so – so this is like you to upload the minute correct, so this is actually a list work for us. So we sould be absolutely happy with that. But the thing is, or the only thing we worry is, because since you said technical people, so if something goes wrong, otherwise we're absolutely fine with that.",
            "What is absolutely fine?",
            "Like if the annotators upload the minute themselves, so –",
            "Actually I'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me – I should think it over and I didn't do it yet. So I don't know how would I have the control over annotators. The communication. Because I have to send them what all the files manually, otherwise – So I don't know how to do that. I really have to upload the data and it takes time.",
            "I – I think the same PERSON7, I absolutely agree with you. I would not ask this persons to push in GateHub Yes. in the final repository to push there anything. So I would also gain – say that I prefer this – the same strategy that you're using, sending the data –",
            "So probably let's – yes. Let's not do this team for the moment. It could be changed, I think it could – So, wh I and PERSON6 still thought about this option is not – not because of the present situation. Now it's absolutely okay, that we just send them the data. But he thought, overal the situation where they make alignments and it takes more time and somehow it can – it – it can – It is connected with alignments.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So let's not think about it at the moment if possible. And if needed we would kind of build it on the – on the existing system. So at the moment I would prefer to have the contact with annotators, but actually I'm really Wonderful. good in that, so rather use.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, PERSON7, so – so – let – PERSON2 said in the morning – I also like – To some extent I thought and I – I think I also believe to some extent – So – we have an actually manual evaluation. What is the – like, what is the vision.",
            "Aou want me to repeat why you need the alignment? Why we need the al.",
            "No, no. I – I need the al. I – understood we need the alignment, but I was talk, so we must have a measure or a by which we can use the alignment to produce something.",
            "Great, so, we do alignment, fine, the manual are done, but what is the final output? It should be some files and some nubers.",
            "Final oi output of what.",
            "Final output of the alignment.",
            "Could I ask you, please, now, if you could write this very question very explicitly somewhere into – into the agenda.",
            "Okay.",
            "Because I think there should be a total understand – understanding between us what do you mean. I'm not sure – First I'm not sure that I understand what you ask and second I'm not sure – I'm not sure I can answer. I'd rather think that answer should go from other source.",
            "Okay. Okay, so I'm typing in that – in that –",
            "Just form the question.",
            "ORGANIZATION2 doc.",
            "So how are we going to use the alignment in evaluation? What is the measure or mid-check of this activity?",
            "Well, I – now I understand it. I think it's a very good question and I don't think that we have answered it yet. So we as. PERSON6 has kind of vague idea that it helps and so have I. So this w. So we have some experimen experience with other tasks where such alignment helped somehow. And we have the intuition based on some experiments with other data, that it would help. Probably I'm a little bit sceptic now, but I – I really think that at the moment it is not solved. So this is what – If you would ask PERSON6 this question he would probably say that think about it and make o or invent the measure or metric for – for that. So I've like – I – I would pick up from this here, so the thing is that meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy. Like I'm just talking form point of view. So, probably we have to submit the proposal within the first week of November. Okay, so, it – I do see this coming within October, that I'll be measure and that is accepted that, okay? This is a manual measure for automatic minority. So the thing is that this is, right? So, do you think that it could be thing? Because if we like – I don't want a that – Suppose we say about –",
            "Sorry, sorry, I lost the u lost the idea. Do you think that we should include what, evaluation measure?",
            "Do you think this alignment –",
            "Or alignment?",
            "First, alignment first, manual evaluation measure –",
            "Okay –",
            "Should be a part of the shared task?",
            "I don't think about it. I don't know, I have no idea. So I really don't know. I think this is the you should discuss in more detail with PERSON6.",
            "Because –",
            "So I this points.",
            "So this – I would say –",
            "I have never had any experiments with shared task and measures and so on. So I – what I am saying is kind of my intuition. I Okay. cannot answer.",
            "Okay.",
            "Rather – Go. Either think with PERSON4 about – about that or think with PERSON4, PERSON2 and PERSON6, not me, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, so suppose they does speak a scenario that we don't come up with a manual evaluation measure, before the shared task, so, what options we have. So the options that we have is – we have the transcript, which is manually corrected, we have the minute, which is the, contains the summary. And then we reuse the data and we evaluate the submissions based on automatic measure.",
            "Do we – Where do we get the automatic measure?",
            "There are many automatic measures for summarisation.",
            "But none of them works as PERSON4 realised.",
            "How many do you have tried?",
            "How many what?",
            "How many – how many automatic measures have you tried?",
            "Ask PERSON4.",
            "Okay.",
            "Let – So in summarising paper on that maybe PERSON2 also knows, none of them really works well.",
            "Well I wouldn't say none of them really works well, I would say that they are kind of deceptive in some cases like they tch they are very high – very high –",
            "Yes.",
            "And then somebody just repeated this that – this that – this that, so you. So they must be compo – like associated with the human score. Like decives them, we first add them, because we – they are very easy to compute. But we add another human evaluation score, that was the point of that I wrote the protocol, like try to come up with some tips. So, we need the na next try human evaluation, decides them, we compute them, but we add the number of human evaluation, so that we can be sure that we have good quality. That's the point.",
            "I agree with you. But that human evaluation should be like very subjective and, right?",
            "No, it's not very subjective, it's like – We I – I think – Did you read the document that I wrote? The protocol I wrote?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "There is how most of the like evaluations are done in the community, in the literature. Like have a summary or a text and we compare it with the reference and we have the annotators th to compare it. And they like try to assess different aspects like reada readibility, the quality etc, and they put scores of that. And then we have this five stars for rating – rating scale, from one to five stars. And then we abbregate, we wait this – let say this aspects, and we come up with the – with the final score. This is the most common and easy way to – to do it you know. That's why I proposed that. But then PERSON6 has his own idea about this alignments and I don't really know, I know nothing about, so that's it.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I – I – I got – I got the multimission of the meeting script, but still that is like the that PERSON6 is targetting to achieve would you be more objective? And the liker giving skills, okay, but still I would believe that it is subjective.",
            "Yes, I mean –",
            "Right.",
            "It's human based and every – every human evaluation is subjective, so – Everyone is doing it that way, so – I mean most of the research evaluat human evaluation in nature language generation is done that way, so.",
            "Okay, wonderful. Okay, so, like – Okay, so the thing is that if we don't come up with the alignment based manual evaluation, we will do as the normally the other energy task entries, right?",
            "I'm really sorry, I didn't follow you.",
            "Yeah, so – if we – if we are like – if we are not able to come up with the alignment, if we are not able to come up with the alignment based manual evaluation measure –",
            "Yes.",
            "We go with – we go with the, the.",
            "Yes, sure, sure. Yes, why not, yes. That's – yes, okay, why not.",
            "Okay, so may I – may I summarise it, please? So –",
            "Yeah.",
            "So really we want to use alignment annotation for summarisation, this is variant A. But we have little time and very probably we don't have to prepare this alignments. And in this case we follow variant B, and this is using human evaluation like readibility and so on, not using the alignment.",
            "Right.",
            "So –",
            "Yes. Yes, so – so the thing is that my before November it would be difficult to come up with the alignment this score, so for the past shared task that we have way to propose speech, I think we should go whatever is available and whatever is better to us. And then maybe we would also like do some research on this and we come with some beautiful matrix, And then maybe the second – you know the second event we can come up with this new – new techniques that we want to do. Halo?",
            "So this – this – You were talking to PERSON7 or to me?",
            "I'm talking to you.",
            "So, I'm really confused.",
            "Probably yes. He just – you are just trying to summarise what we did and what we said, yes, yes.",
            "I'm just worried about like what the proposal should look like, because like for variant B there are still like some cloud on that. We are not very clear. So, I just want that the proposal should be like very strong, and whatever we say shoould have a ground – grounded this is to that. So, I now loose – I know there are many autoatic measures for summarisation so if we like just put those in the proposal no one we question? And we – if we like say that we are going to human evaluation using the like pst like the reading skill or how they, no one we yuestion? But if we are not believed here about the alignment, so that's it. That's why my nice.",
            "I kind of don't know what to say. So, I don't knw what you propose. You propose directly to go plan – plan B, yes?",
            "No, B – we – like we have plan B as our backup. If varian A doesn't become clear to us before the proposal submission deadline, we move in variant B. If variant A is very clear, its concensus is accepted by all of us, we obviously go with variant B.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay, okay. Okay, so, yeah so I think – I think no – PERSON7 you wanted to discuss something? I have understood what is that PERSON6 was speaking about. Yeah, it's how we should do the shared task and –",
            "Yeah, so – so, what I wanted to discuss is probably the format of the basic sample trial. But this is – I think we should read with this – that format before PERSON1 appears and discuss it with PERSON1.",
            "So this – My – my point of how to create basic samples should be discussed with PERSON1 before we go on. So for now I don't prepare any basic samples more. And then I – When PERSON1 appears I will discussed – discuss with him, if his annotation tool can work with the samples, And then prepare the second version of basic samples. Point? And, as for the data format, this is also a point with PERSON2 –",
            "As for the data format I'm already clear, like it's what we discussed like the three – three sections in each file. The first section is meta-data, you put on meta-data there, And you're right in brackets meta-data. And then, the second distrust it, as I each, so the second and the third are crossed in the summary. And in the summary you can keep the bullets, but only with dashes.",
            "Yes.",
            "One dash, two dashes etc.",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is – I think this is the – So it's almost like I said, but you can – I said to remove the meta-data, You can put them with – with a label in your brackets –",
            "Yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important.",
            "So it's – it's almost the same, so the format is stable –",
            "Yes, this is – Well, I think I will have to discuss it with you before I begin once more about some details.",
            "Yes, sure, because – Yes,",
            "But, yes, but –",
            "But I think this is a – Because this way you put all the information, you put practically put on all information, because you have the meta-data the summary. There is nothing –",
            "Yes, yes. So it's good, isn't it? It was not my point.",
            "You deserve the hierarchy of the bullets, but only with recognisable, because is not recognisable, so.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "I think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like anonymisation of – anonymisation of the names of this annotators. We need – we need to encall them, so you have to prepare a list with their real full names and their annot01, annot02, annot03 and that you have to put in the folders. So, you will have to rename PERSON5. You will keep a list, where PERSON5 is like PERSON5 what – I don't know is her name and then you put annot01, as a sample example. And then you will use the zer annot01 as the name to the folder structure that you – that we have, so you will have to rename the folder structure.",
            "PERSON2, lwt's do it – So, the question do it when we do it who does it. So, an I –",
            "What do you mean? What – what – what, like renaming in the structure in the directory or the list, or what do you –",
            "So, now we are looki. We are kind of changing the data storage from Sorbow to GateHub repository.",
            "No, we will keep both of them. We'll keep the –",
            "Yes, I know, but st. Yes. But we are kind of centralizing it and we're making server as one of mocking versions of GateHub repository, so who is doig all of that?",
            "Once again, please, I couldn't hear you. Where are restoring –",
            "Who – who does all that GateHub things?",
            "For the GateHub it's only pushes, I do it. There is nothing to do in the GateHub for you. You will just walk in the cluster. What I was saying is that you or I or together we will have to rename the names in the cluster, all the names.",
            "Yes, yes –",
            "From PERSON5 – from PERSON5 you will put annot01, like anonymise the name.",
            "When? Before a create in GateHub or it doesn't – or it doesn't –",
            "Before pushing, before pushing to Gatehub.",
            "Before pushing? This was my question.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So –",
            "Yes, sure, before pushing. Because in GateHub it has to appear as anonymous, as annot01.",
            "Aha Yeah, so before pushing. I have to change all the names, So it means, that for each annotator I have to change the name form PERSON51, from ANNOTATOR2 to annot2 –",
            "Yes.",
            "Somebody – So – and if I –",
            "Yes, so you create the file – you create the file the document that – internal – that you have access to, or even a notebook let say, a paper notebook, And you have to keep the – the names of this collaborators or annotators, their full names –",
            "Yes, this is clear.",
            "And an anonymous name that is annot01, annot02, etc, yeah? And you will record of this list –",
            "Perfect, so this is okay, yes.",
            "Record of this list when you name the folders with their collaborators.",
            "Yes, so this is – this is what –",
            "This is what I like. If I – if I am allowed to do it so, I like it so. Because I'm not able at the moment, I'm not sure if I can be – if I can make but I – at the moment it is very complicated for me to anonymise all of the files to – so to name general names. I have to keep the names – this final names of the files recognisable. So it may – it should not be the name of the annotator, but it should be some ID that I can dete that I can determine where to put it.",
            "Yes, I told you, annot01 is like –",
            "Yes, yes, in this case it is a, so nw my task is to rename the files.",
            "Yes, but before that I also have – I mean, I also propose some other things but you didn't have time to discuss them, so, I'm not sure –",
            "So, let's meet today, PERSON2, let's meet today in person? To more –",
            "PERSON6 would be – better to have also PERSON6, I don't know, when he's available now, or tomorrow, or – So maybe it's better to set up another meeting, like today – Like one of the day in the morning? So, I think PERSON6 –",
            "So, just – Okay, okay. So let's write – write PERSON6 when he has time, so –",
            "Yes it would be very good.",
            "Or I can Friday and again, I have web seminars Thursday –",
            "Probably, tomorrow morning or evenyou want today afternoon or some time? It would be very good to have also PERSON6 to seome things.",
            "Yes.",
            "Because I'm really worried about this team that he's proposing, so, I disagree with PERSON6 about several things, so we nedd to discuss.",
            "Yes, be everybody in person, yes, perf. I agree.",
            "So –",
            "So –",
            "I'll write him and you now and –",
            "Yes, try to – we try to catch him.",
            "Meeting tomorrow morning.",
            "We try to catch him as soon as possible.",
            "Yes, not today, I am already at home – What?",
            "Okay. The meeting. I will –",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, something like the meeting of today, you were also present –",
            "Yeah.",
            "Repeat the one today.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, okay. Okay, so now we're just – Like everything is like almost sorted. The thing is that we have to like wait for PERSON1 to actually that – this annotation tool composed for new idea.",
            "Yeah, PERSON4 is writing. I was waiting and tried install ORGANIZATION2 again and with different e-mail adress. Now it asking me meeting password. Could someone please provide to my lock? Do you let me know if something concers me? He needs some password to, what does it mean? Which password? Meeting password, what is that?",
            "I think the meeting pass. Yeah, the meeting password is minuting, which is already there in the meeting.",
            "Could you – could it – could you please send it to PERSON4?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "But anyway, I would rather probably finish it for today.",
            "Yeah, okay. I too think so.",
            "PERSON2, anything else you want to discuss?",
            "No.",
            "No, I mean I definitely – with definitely with PERSON6 to – Because today we didn't finish, like we left some issues without dicsussing them, so – We cannot really discuss anything without PERSON6, because –",
            "Exactly, yeah. There are like decission points, decisions points has to take, so yeah.",
            "So, there is nothing to discuss today anymore. Okay –",
            "So, have a nice evening, everybody.",
            "Okay, goodbye.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Bye.",
            "Goodbye, and stay. Bye.",
            "You too. I'm not, you know, wanting is like, yes? Yes, in this case, it is he. So now my task is to return..."

But, the it's good to see you after, all this all these complications with Covid. PERSON14 seems kind of, yeah, frozen. I don't know whether the picture is frozen or PERSON14 is frozen. Or whether this is just, a photo. It's probably just a photo.",
            "Just a profile picture.",
            "Yeah, okay. So good to, good to, good to have you all of you here. There is something PERSON14, which we need to discuss, directly. And that's the it's actually mentioned. Here is the organization of the IWSLT presentations. So do you have any preference or do you have any idea how do we do it? Because PERSON16 already asks, asked a while ago. Are you making any steps in this, or decisions?",
            "No, I haven't done any steps and decisions, I thought sort of you'd ask with doing it.",

            "Yes, exactly. So yeah, exactly. So let's let's no organize a panel, let's just do the. So we will need to have probably pre-recorded summary of the results, presentation.",
            "Well, we have to pick which paper, probably one paper I guess. I have to look it up again. So which paper is sort of suppose to be presented as an paper?",

            "Okay.",

            "Yeah. So hopefully there is only one slot for us to present the overall results. And the rest is hopefully done across all the tasks. That will be like -",
            "Let me let me see, I'm. Okay, I have to saw that because I've got maybe 2 dozen or more emails on that topic.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So have I and -",
            "And so PERSON16's latest proposal was. So over your paper will be exactly, podcast. Twice at 9 am and 6 pm Seattle time, so essentially, European time, US time. With different speakers or papers will be pre-recorded. 20 minutes poster, 5 minutes pre-recording, pre-recorded talks. Okay, he says, he wants to organize workshop workshops sessions of 1 or each 1 evaluation. Tricks. So might we that we have to organize a -",

And I don't know whether they were officially, reminded about the meeting. So they could only, watch, but share their mind. Just the question who is this Me Firefox cross? Someone's name is, Me Firefox. Would you know, who that person is? I can probably unmute the person, But I don't know, whether that would be polite enough to unmute someone. Well, lets hope, that there is no sp yep. So -",

But there is lot of things that we have to discuss. So, you have seen the agenda before. If you have any, things that you would like to bring, up on the agenda, Please, put them there right now. And also make sure to have your, if I'm s talking all the time. So let's start with the, with the, the postponed review. So it's seems, that people have not. So PERSON11, please, let us know what this doodle is. This is that we need to figure out, the date.",
            "Okay, so it's because the review will postpone till September. And we should give, our project officer the new, a new date. And I see more people finally voted it, so.",
            "So maybe we'd. We have ORGANIZATION6, we have, PERSON2. Yeah, so maybe there is a chance to pick a date. Okay, so thanks for thanks for your vote. And we'll see, what comes out and we'll let you know maybe already now. So then the financial tables. This is a preparation, for the new official submission. So since we have there you only in September, Then there is, time enough to have all the numbers in their final form. I don't know about your institutions, At our institutions, we normally can provide the final numbers at the earliest like 2 weeks or 3 weeks. After the respective month has ended. And since the 1st period, which we are reviewing end with June, We cannot have the official numbers from our part earlier then in mid July, or towards the end of July. I expect the same applies to you. And the EU gives us 2 months actually to finalize these numbers. So we ask for the financial tables with the deadline of May, for like a testing purposes. So that it we would get an estimate from you, And we would also like double check that you are sending as the numbers, that we understand. And, that we can put it together. And that everything makes sense already before the, the final dates. So, is anybody, missing? ORGANIZATION5, yes. So we would like to get, these estimate, numbers from ORGANIZATION5. And, we will review those, that we have received. And please, be ready to have the final versions of these, Which includes June, spendings, in mid July, or late July. And from that point, until the end of August, We have to finalize it and send it as 1 of the report, Or maybe fill it in, in the online system, So that the EU knows. So expect that at the boundary of July and August, there would be some paper with necessary on your side. And especially in your respective financial departments. But everything. The content should be already pretty clear after this dry run with, with the May preview of that. Are we aware of any problems there? Do we expect anything strange, anything like unforeseen and unplanned? To any to -",
            "Hi PERSON10, I'm in here from ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "No, we don't expect any problems. The only thing is, that we're not turn out to see the numbers from our colleagues, all the salaries.",
            "Okay.",
            "That's the reason why we already have to put it to our of finance department. And they come back with number.",
            "Yes.",
            "So that.",
            "That is okay.",
            "We are late, that's that's -",
            "That is totally okay.",
            "We can't estimated it because we don't know all the salaries.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "That's that's the thing why we'd be late.",
            "Yeah, this numbers should come from your financial department anyway as sum. It's not, like separated by individual people, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This is this is all, standard.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Still, I would like you to get in touch, Or maybe link directly you financial people with, with us.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So that we know, that we understand the tables the same way.",
            "Yep, yep.",
            "That's the purpose.",
            "Yeah, that's.",
            "That is the purpose that is the purpose of the like dry run, Which, which was due, end of May.",
            "Okay, okay, great, we will do this.",
            "So yeah, so this dry run should happen anyway.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "The numbers will be approximate, but it's to test whether we understand each other. And then in July, it would be easy to get the, final numbers.",
            "Okay, great we will we will tell the - We have 1 person in our finance department, who was responsible for the European stuff, So we all European projects will talk to she will come back to us.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank, you. So then the most important, stuff to deal with is the large pretty large set of deliverables. Here are the Overleaf links. And we have the reviewer chosen. We don't have a reviewer for the report on NLP technologies.",
            "I can do that I guess.",
            "Either, yes, either you, or I thought that it could even be ORGANIZATION5. Because it is a workshop, which was planned and it will happen, Once it happen, once it happens for lay people. So for people not, not familiar with NLP technologies at all. So it could, thanks for volunteering, I'm I'm searching for, the appropriate uh-huh, appropriate, but it's. I have to see it elsewhere, so that I don't disturb in my office. And that's pretty annoying. Where is the - I don't see the, yeah, the numbers are too. Sorry, too small screen. Yeah, that's it. So the, the reviewer for - And we don't, yeah. The reviewer on spoken language translation, which is overseen by ORGANIZATION11 is also missing. I don't know who could do that because it's - We are all in involved.",
            "It's it's PERSON3 in my table that I see.",
            "Oh, you see PERSON3 as a reviewer?",
            "Yes, because it's in the ORGANIZATION12 doc, but not in the.",
            "Oh, okay. Okay, so I'm looking at the sheet. So that's PERSON3 is reviewing, that's good. And then report and dissemination. So that's another important thing. This a report, that has to be written by ORGANIZATION5, But everybody should contribute their data. So, if you haven't done so yet, Please, make sure to enter all your dissemination activities remote, or in person, Which obviously was limited, into the continuous reporting table. The link for the continues reporting table is just, on, under the page break here. So yeah. That's, the 7.4 for please be aware, That everyone needs to, needs to fill this, Google sheet. So that is an.",

            "Yep.",
            "Thanks again, for saying that we need more input. Especially what we were we need especially more input is in the scientific dissemination part. And the workshop and NLP technologies. Also, what would be very good, If you participated on trade 1st, Or after Covid 19 outbreak on a kind of online. Just let us know, so we can integrate it in our report.",
            "Yeah. So about the about the workshop, I suggest, that we actually say, That more details are in this separate deliverable, the 7.2. Because the workshop actually did not take place. There were preparations and we will write -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "What the preparations were, when dids any dry run sessions happen, What was the planned content of the workshops, Or the like the workshop as package is essentially ready. It was just not delivered because the Covid crisis. So there is, like no dissemination actually happened, but the.",
            "But the preparation for dissemination.",
            "Yeah, but preparation for.",
            "Can I ask for clarification here? So I see that, someone also entered the papers, which they published. Should we do that also in this dissemination sheet? When we published a papers and name PROJECT5 is not should be put in.",
            "That's a good question. So it. We should report all the papers somewhere and maybe these dise. So a definitely, we need to collect all the information, Ideally Bibtech, entries from my point of view. For all the papers, which acknowledge, PROJECT5. And the yes, let's let's probably think that the best place is indeed this report. If there is some other online -",
            "It's it's it's partipi participation to a conference so, I mean, usually we participate to a conference, where we published a paper.",
            "That's fair. What is the expected number of people at IWSLT and -",
            "Yeah, yeah. So we don't know, but d that yeah. I'm bad with like this table filling thing. So fill something reasonable. Yeah, so.",
            "So should we put a papers into this document? I mean, as, PERSON21 has. I'm not sure that. It doesn't seem a great format really, but -",
            "Yeah, exactly doesn't seem, as a good format.",
            "The in the pre-review, which we had -",

            "Yeah.",

            "I understood, that some kind of semi-automated system for getting papers. And the EU units open IRA or something like that. So.",
            "Yeah.",

            "Okay.",
            "Automatically, the EU can get it. Well, I assume is not fully automatic. There must be some steps like as an PROJECT5 paper.",
            "We'll have to check. So the, I remember, that someone told me that if we simply put the papers into our Biblio, Which is our bibliographical system, then it will get there somehow.",
            "Yeah. That's a similar. I don't know what magic happens in between, but there is -",
            "Yeah.",

            "Yeah, for this spread sheet, PERSON21 has put the paper is here. And PERSON6 has is now putting the IWSLT, paper. But I suggest, that we put here, rather the things, Which do not have a paper associated. So, that happens. They're like, if you have an invited talk at the conference, Then this is what would not appear in open air. And, still you want to mention that. So for regular paper submissions, which have a conference presentation, I would not put them into this table. I would put here all the things that, are not associated with the paper. So the sum of our dissemination activities will be this table plus the papers. So we'll we'll check the open air, thing. And we'll check how the uses that. It's possible, I remember that in the past projects, such as in, You've asked us for Bibtech entries, of the papers. And I don't know what you did with that as the coordinator then.",
            "So that was ideal because. Okay, so I created the website from Bibtech, which was okay.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "There was some style for. But then we had put into the EU system and ended u ended up my new process.",
            "Okay.",
            "I'd to conv I converted Bibtech into spreadsheet ago, somebody in the office type it in. She might stop all the checks names.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then somebody else so fixed all, so that was really about process. Ideally, this open IRA pure or whatever. It's the way to go I just don't fully know how it works.",
            "Yeah, so this for us. So PERSON11, please make sure that we do it, That we examine like what has to be done, And we'll let you know in a week or 2, in what format we need your papers. So the Bibtech for me seems natural, But there is a big risk, That there will be this manual conversion necessary then on our side. So maybe, if we figure out the official format better, Then, we can ask you for the appropriate format right away, Or possibly, if your universities have, a system, which already handles these papers, Then it may get to open - I don't really know what open air is. So, there is chance, that it goes there automatically from big research institution, Such as universities. And then we need to check that everything got there. Yeah, yeah, so this is this is an assignment for, for us. Okay, so, for back to the deliverables. The, so we have reviewers for, everything except the project management guide initial and updates. And there, someone who is experienced with some management, But PERSON22 has already volunteered to do ASR systems. So let's -",
            "And maybe PERSON14?",
            "So there is 2 deliverables, that -",
            "Sure, sure I can do it.",
            "Yeah? So in that case -",
            "Then ORGANIZATION5 can do the NLP and.",
            "Exactly.",
            "And I do the exciting management.",
            "Exactly, yes. Yeah, thank you. So who from ORGANIZATION5? Would that be PERSON12, to review the report on NLP technologies workshop?",
            "Might it would not be me, I guess it would some of our developers. So I have to talk to.",
            "It will be it will be. That's as I said, the workshop is for people not familiar with NLP.",
            "Oh, okay. Yeah so well, If I'm not have to be familiar with that -",
            "Yes.",
            "NLP I guess, I'm the right person.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So yeah, yeah. I would do this, yeah.",
            "Yep. So great. So we have reviewers in the table written for all the deliverables. I'm not going to open the Overleafs now, But you have the Overleaf links here, And, all the main authors responsible sites know, What, what is the status, of each of these deliverables. Remember, that we agreed to have them, essentially by the end of, this week or on Monday. And that's the that's the time, where you should send it to, your reviewer of the deliverable. So that the reviewer has, 2 weeks to, to processes that, And then you have 1 week to incorporate the changes. And we need to submit all these deliverables, at the latest on June, on the last of June. So I think, that we're generally doing good. We. I know of that some of the deliverables have not. Yeah, well, started yet. And there will negotiate with the respective reviewer to. We will buy some extra time for from them. But, across the board, I think, that we are proceeding reasonably well. So if you have any questions, Any like problems with partners, not contributing to your deliverable, please, mention that. So that so that everybody is aware that, it's not just the main author, But obviously all the participating sites, who have to contribute. But I think everybody knows their job. And everybody is, doing a great job, actually. So one thing, which is still not fully clear to me, is that this. We will write the report the 7.2. About all the preparations, and stating that the workshop has actually not taken place. But, PERSON5 also said, That they are proposing a partial report for milestones. Because they are also associated milestones, And, these milestones normally do not have report. So I'm kind of confused, what should we do here? These are milestone for the events, which were postponed. So, we will have to check and PERSON11 that's again something for us to do. What exactly should we should we do for an event, which has a milestone, But the event has not taken, place. Yep. The but the now at the same time, We received this information, that we leave that milestone. Okay, that's confusing. So we'll sort out. So, if you have missed that information. The new Congress date is already, known. It luckily falls still within our project, And reasonably, within that. It's from 30th of May to the 3rd of June 2021. And the workshop itself will be on the 1st of, June. So that's that's good. Please, block these dates. And since you have so much time ahead, Maybe you can consider planning at a visit to LOCATION1. It would be a good thing, anyway to, to see each other in person. So yep. Okay. Then, the demo. That's something, which kept us pretty busy. And it's still, keeps us a pretty busy. Despite all the problems and the unfortunate postponing, that we had to do -",
            "If we inform PERSON5 about the new date.",
            "So we don't have the date. So I would like to ask PERSON15, what is the curr and also ORGANIZATION2. What is the current status and the newest messages about.",
            "It seems like since yesterday afternoon we have permanent power again.",
            "Okay.",
            "So successful. I'm still waiting for the all-clear report. And with a all, service have come up successfully again, Some of the, file service, we are still doing file system checks, But it looks like we should be back to operation walls.",
            "Um-hum. That's good.",
            "Wonderful.",
            "Yeah, that's that's that's, that's great, actually. So, we have also as you know, we have experience, power outages ourselves, And the everything is unstable. So, there is still the risk, that every that something will fail, But I think that it is now good time to, to ask for the, date, For the new date with the project officer, right?",
            "I think so. I mean -",
            "Yeah. So PERSON15, could you again please prepare a an internal pole? So that we like, with a large number of dates, That we reduce the number of dates, that we offer to the, project officer. And then, please, everybody filling this quickly. So that we can hopefully email, the options to PERSON5. Could you email him tomorrow? With the options, obviously, not the date choice.",
            "Well, first, I would like to check the demo again. And check that all these services are running.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Okay, so let's let's.",
            "I would like.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Solution running before sending a new date.",
            "It was. It I know, that you have been in doing this even after the postponed, dates. And PERSON18 is doing this regularly.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I think that everything is actually working, but yes, I understand. So lets do the internal pole, And let's fill it, the internal pole during the end of this week. And then, on Monday, or Tuesday the latest, Let's have the dates, ready the options, ready for PERSON5. And let's give them the. I'm pushing this earlier as because like we are getting quite far into June, Since there would be again some delay, 1 day until they decide, what they what they would prefer. So it seems like, the best week for the demo would be if around the 15th. Like from in the 2nd half of June, essentially.",
            "Um-hum, yes.",
            "Right?",
            "I agree, I agree.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, so that's. If we send, PERSON5 the options, very early next week, Then, the choices validate from, the, 2nd half of June would make sense. So let's let's do that. Yeah, so -",
            "Okay.",
            "Yep. So the demo will tentatively take place in on 1 of the days, of the, in the 2nd half of June. Okay, s yeah so with the demo, There we have, had some very interesting experience ourselves, All of us, in the technical team. And, there are 2 messages, that I, like take from this. So 1 of the messages is that we actually should have all our components replicated, At all other at some other sides. So everybody, should, make sure that, for each of his workers, There is, another site, who can also run the same worker. Nd we have done this now for ORGANIZATION2 workers. Because there were, the actual problems. We are able if I'm not mistaken, to run some of the ORGANIZATION11 MT systems. And what we have not done is to provide our systems to others, yet. So the actually, our side is now the least the least safe for this demo. And this is something, that, I would like, to ask PERSON18 to do. PERSON22 proposed a dockerisation. We don't really use docker our servers because of these pseudo access needs. But we do, or other colleagues, not me, do it on some virtual machines. So we'll see, I was curious, yeah, yeah. So PERSON22 has no experience. I was curious about this singularity. That's the rootless, docker. So.",
            "We do use docker that way. You do have to said, you'd have to a route once to set the permission on the docker socket.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And make your user part of the docker group, But after that, you don't need to run docker.",
            "But then, you need still.",
            "It's still insecure in a way because the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The actual docker stuff is running as root. And files that the docker writes back to your system, will be owned by root, Which can mean convenient. But in principle, you can run docker containers without root.",
            "I mean, we and all and other projects some worker. And we deliver MT system dockerized. We don't exists were dockerizing systems, But we kind of know how to do it.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "It really seems a much better way to go, Than giving people my new instructs since ORGANIZATION4 some pieces ORGANIZATION4 fair. I mean, I know dockers're p not perfect. And sometimes you get a docker and you can get it to run, But if we gonna have this architects, We have all each different components to in different things.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Really, it's it's made for containerization.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the root thing should be something, that you can work around than me. And I don't know because registers we've a run servers, But I'm I'm really surprised, that your IT system are just like no docker. That's not or.",
            "Well, no, there, they said, no docker on cluster. So and they have like virtual machines, which then are okay for, running docker.",
            "Right. Right, okay.",
            "So there is -",
            "Docker plays nicely with the ID approach machines. Because the you fire up, in many machine.",
            "Yep.",
            "1 to and just -",
            "Yeah.",
            "You yes, you kind a need a things dockerized otherwise, Or some you need some components.",
            "Yeah, so we will so we will investigate what exactly can we do. And we'll try to package our systems and get back to PERSON22 and, And also PERSON6 for this system. So the question, that I have here now is. Because we have the ASR systems for Czech, that's PROJECT2 based.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "We also have some Jasper based, But these are not integrated yet because of the missing segmentation. And, we have PROJECT3, or PROJECT4 systems. And, I think, that it would make sense, if, if we made sure, That the ASR systems could be run at ORGANIZATION2 and the translation systems in ORGANIZATION11. Or would you propose any other, like back up partners?",
            "Seems fine to us I mean. Yeah, I suppose it would be easier for us some run PROJECT3 and PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, sounds reasonable to me as well.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we will try that. I'm not sure if we -",
            "1 guestion?",
            "Yeah?",
            "What this ASR what is it should be used?",
            "No, No, PROJECT2 uses CPU.",
            "Yep.",
            "But they're no running, I mean as a called back up, isn't it?",
            "This is a called back up, but it should be it like tested once, in case we need it.",
            "Should be able to run.",
            "It should be able to run, yes.",
            "Well, yeah. You don't you don't need to GPU for these systems you're asking.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Only in emergency, but ek as PERSON8 said, and yeah, I also had that impression. PROJECT2 is CPU based. On the other hand the punctuator is GPU based, right?",
            "No, it some CPU.",
            "And was it fast enough? I remember we had some problems with this.",
            "I think PERSON8 fixed it.",
            "Okay, you said, that there was the like the old Python virtual environment. And everything got fixed when the virtual environment was recreated.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "But it c it can run on GPU, I think. On.",
            "Okay. S, so and the punctuator, should we give it also to ORGANIZATION2, or to someone else?",
            "Yeah, if I'm not mistaken.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well.",
            "Sorry guys, please.",
            "Um-hum?",
            "That of ORGANIZATION2, we are, we have the, virtual machine for ORGANIZATION2 services up and running.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "If you if you mean, space, or another virtual machine, or whatever. The only, open point for me is the, GPU configuration.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Because actually, I have to ask before, but our virtual machine, you know, with the.",
            "With the GPU, yeah.",
            "But please, remember, that of course, we are able to.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Support you.",
            "Yeah. So we could we could give to spread it across the consortium, We could give the punctuator to ORGANIZATION6.",
            "I mean I mean that's that's also the way to do it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just like a virtual machine image.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "You just fire up, anyone can fire up, it's not like you have to you have to call.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like ORGANIZATION11, get them to run it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know that's easier, but I mean it's more flexible.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I haven't since I haven't really done it, it's, it's hard for me to access, so we.",
            "I know, I know.",
            "You know. Okay, so that's good, we know what to do. I don't know whether we'll manage to have these systems package before the demo, But hopefully, there won't be any power outage an our, at our site.",
            "So that was the 1 thing, that I've learnt, That we must not, that we must have, replicated, components across the site. And the other very important message, that I've learnt was that we must avoid updating the systems before the demo. So we should the way I've put it is that we should have like a production system. And a development system, a complete setup. And the production system has to be stable without any new segmenters, any new updates for a long period of time. Because the whole, pipeline is pretty complex. And the interdepencies interdependencies are very like, the it's it's sensitive to all the little details. So the performance can be immediately killed by introducing a better segmenter, W the caching of which is not in perfect line with caching of the machine translation system.",
            "Yeah, I mean PERSON10, you're you're basically asking again you're asking for sort of more professional software setup.",
            "Yep.",
            "Really, you're asking for a staging in a production and development.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ranges this kind of thing. And again, as that's also very compatible with things like with dockerization and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And thing the like. But you know, it takes to run it, it doesn't.",
            "Yep.",
            "Yep, It does no.",
            "Yeah. Exactly. So, so maybe, obviously, we are not a software company. And, our resources for these are limited. So I take all the excuses that you will come up with to in order to avoid, this need. To put it in our terms, or to put it in our setting, Is the main message, that I would like to ask all the partners. To avoid doing any updates to their workers shortly before the demo. And shortly means like week or 2 perhaps. So if you, so we had that we had this like a surge of activity, When people were really trying to help the demo. And aside from the bomb and power outage it ORGANIZATION2, This also put the demo at very big risk.",
            "So may be you have not realized it, the demo postponed for other reasons, But by this last day activities, we could have, destroyed our the demo ourselves. Even without the power outage.",
            "See, we need to feature for use, basically.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So, and at the same time, we want to test the, the, components, better components. Because I know, that PERSON6 had something which could be very, very promising for the ASR, right? I don't know what is the status of that. PERSON6? Could you have some -",
            "But you mean -",
            "So I thought - So you've mentioned, the that your submission to IWSLT, or paper, paper to IWSLT.",
            "Right now right now that's text based, still that's right now only for the for the MT side.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "I hope, we didn't that say 1 year update at the SLT. But it's future research.",
            "Okay. And what component is that? Is that, tec translation of the, of like stream of wor or?",
            "To put it into a into the mediator terms, that would be unsegmented text to text in another language.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah. And this works and has a better results. For in your machines.",
            "I have not compared it -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Directly against. This against our models, that's something else I need to do.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, it works.",
            "And the current model, that you have -",
            "I don't know, if it is better.",
            "Is English to German.",
            "German to English.",
            "German to English. Okay.",
            "But I mean, it's no problem to train it the other way around.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But German to English 1st is translation is more interesting directly.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Because that's one way have we final to not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "With language.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is exactly a candidate for a thing, which if it work an if it was well integrated, It will be great to demo it. But it also is a big risk, for that set up. So the way to -",
            "That is not in this demo. I mean I'm -",
            "Yep.",
            "I that feel like that is not ready for this demo.",
            "Yeah.",
            "This there is no worker that does this yet and.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "The system is like tested under research conditions only.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's actually, it's it's it's specifies me. Because I always attempted to put the best features there, But if you're saying, that this cannot happen for the demo, Then yes, there is less risk, that will break the demo with that. So, what I wanted to say. Is that we are finally getting to that like kind of regular testing of the systems integrated in the pipeline, So that we are when we are starting a pipeline. We have lockdirs, which record the outputs, including time stamps. We have since the IWSLT, some evaluation. This is something, that has to be, like double-checked. Whether we doing it, properly, or whether there're bugs in the in the evaluation, implementation, This all possible. But, and we are also working on the PROJECT5 test set. Which, will cover further language pairs and set-ups than the IWSLT shared task. And, I would, like to have this ladder climbing approach finally starting. This ladder climbing needs that we'll be regularly testing a new models and new components in the pipeline. And putting all the results into one single table and that will tell us, What is our current best technology for this particular set-up. And the fingerprinting, is quite good, to separate, the versions of the modules. So that's, my idea, that for the demo and other like important things. We would have frozen fingerprints, and for the research, There would be also workers, which are not path parts of the path, of this frozen fingerprints, But which are, for testing. And we will be regularly running different set-ups, And, the frozen fingerprints would be then, the thing to demo. And for, the so and we would obviously move, Like a research fingerprint to a to a frozen fingerprint, only when we are confident, That all the components are stable and they play well together. So, so starting with this, big, the software engineering, request to properly separate diploid versions. And then the still like the proper staging of the systems. I'm actually reducing it to the plan of having frozen fingerprints and research fingerprints. And we need to come up with, some form of just a, having a consist list of this. So that we know, what is stable and what is frozen. Yeah, so this is, so this is, the message, that I wanted to, to tell you. But at this point, I hope, that, that PERSON18 is on top of this. And that we know, which, fingerprint paths do we want to demo for the various, input documents. I'm not going to discuss all that, We have a, a separate, separate Google doc. Now, since, a new date for the demo will be, found out. I think we again should start these frequent sessions, where would test this. So, if PERSON15 could, also propose, dates for, the dry run c, calls for like demo, sessions. Before the demo. Test session before demo. That would be great.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yep. And, in these sessions, we would finalize the fingerprints. We already have the documents, So PERSON18 has not, not filled this yet, but we are in. For some of the videos we actually have the correct transcripts. And even reference translations, for some. So this would allow us to directly evaluate, which systems are the best. Obviously, this is like a, the th overfitting, This is this is already, cheating, in terms of, like showing the real the real performance, But I think, that, we can do in the demo we can do for example the same video, presented twice. Once with the like properly devset chosen, system. And for the 2nd time, using the test, set chosen system, which is the cheating. And, the, the reason to, to do this, Including with the knowledge of the reference transcript and reference, translations. Is to give the viewers and also ourselves, a chance to see the relation between the number in the score. And the actually preserved quality. So this is not a, not a r scientific experiment. And if we if we say that: „Yes, we have chosen the system, the particle configuration, Which works best on this demo. \" It is not also cheating, it's like we acknowledged that. So, please, let me know if you if you are opposed to this approach, But I think it's, it's better for everybody to know, what is the. This is benchmark, how far can we get. This is not, the not, the not a proper evaluation, This is what is the best performance that we can deliver, a kind of test. Please, let me know, if you if you had any problems with, with this goal. Of presenting the videos, for example twice, Once with the devset chosen system and 2nd time with this test set chosen system. Yeah. So the main message is that we will have a number of demo, dry run sessions again. And the date for the demo will be chosen, And, we will choose and freeze, the fingerprints for the demo. Okay, so that was enough for the demo. And now PERSON22, brought up, point, which is which is important. I've mentioned that already in the previous call if I'm, not mistaken, But I know, that we have not maken, we have not made any steps to that.",
            "Whether we want to make use of the Covid crisis to get little time extension, Little or longer time extension, of the project. So I don't know if PERSON22 is aware any date until we should make our, mind.",
            "I haven't I well, I haven't been in a contact with a project office, But well, Alex told me as that -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "If we, ask for an extension, I will be automatically.",
            "Okay.",
            "We make it, the opportunity later. But maybe it's not so automatic?",
            "Okay.",
            "But don't quite understand that, so I'm not sure with all of that, But I think, you saying, you've got an email from a project officer?",
            "Yeah, that was awhile ago and I haven't followed up on that, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I mean that yeah, we should probably response later.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And by now, all of us are kind of I have to, I've forgot, All of us are resembling our sort of in term figures.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And we can see whether we're understanding, Cause that would be 1 argument for extending.",
            "Yep.",
            "The deadline. But I also mentioned this other thing, which isn't really Covid related, but.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We f we finish the project to December and writing deliverables in December is always. It's not great, really.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So giving a some month or 2 -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "To write the final deliverables -",
            "Um-hum.",
            "This it's really no harm, even if you know, we are not actually spending much money in that time. But that sort of using at for different purpose and Covid related, but maybe it's okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, we shouldn't we shouldn't tell it that way, we could just say.",
            "Um-hum. Yeah, that's.",
            "I wouldn't I wouldn't be again is like an extension for 3 months or so -",
            "3 months.",
            "Okay. Let's, let's take votes on that.",
            "But it of 1 thing, 1 year extension, I probably don't see the purpose.",
            "What that -",
            "Yeah.",
            "What that we can actually.",
            "Yeah, I understood that max 6 months.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But I mean that the consequences the deliverables are delayed, The final reviews are delayed and I assume, that means the final payment is delayed.",
            "Yeah, that's possible.",
            "The universities I shouldn't I imagine, there's not a problem. Because universities begin after, but I'm not sure. The partners might have a problem, more of a problem with that.",
            "Yeah, so that's a question mainly for ORGANIZATION5 and ORGANIZATION6. Would you help would it help you, Or would it h would it be bad for you to ask for 2 or 3 months, of extension.",
            "Well, well, as developer, a little bit of delay, I will appreciate it, of course.",
            "But I have to ask regarding, you know, administrative things and so on. I don't know. I have to ask PERSON3.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so lets, lets agree, that by mid next week, everybody should f like fill this table. By how many months would you like the project to be extended. You can also say 0. And any reasons for that. And we will we'll make a decision. And let you all know 1st, whether you are fine with the decision. Yeah. It's hard for me to plan like this much, ahead, So 2 or 3 months sounds good to me and that's that's it. So. Yeah, so that's that's probably what will be the final result, That we will ask for 2 or 3 months extension of the, of the project. And we should do it, in - Yeah. Until mid yeah, lets say mid June. Right? Okay, so s. We will, decide, on June 8 and ask for the extension before, Or what is too soon 10. This is too soon and ask, before June 15th. Right?",
            "Um-hum.",
            "So please, let us know. Okay, then, we should have a discussion, a technical call on the IWSLT, results. And I think that, this can be, this can happen at the demo dry run sessions as well. Because this is all research partners there. So I think, I still haven't sent you the PDF. I'm not sure if PERSON8 has, of the final results paper, which will be published at IWSLT, obviously. So I'll send you that. And this is for us to, make use of the IWSLT shared task to choose the best systems, that we have at hand. And also to validate, whether we have screwed up the evaluation or whether it is, actually correct. So, lets simply yeah, review the methodology, Lets use one of the dry run, demos, sessions for this. PERSON10 will send, SLT findings, findings PDF. Yeah, okay. And then, I, I've already talked at the beginning with PERSON14 about IWS, IWSLT remote presentation. So, I said, that PERSON8 is already starting to prepare slides, plus video, As pre-recorded presentation for the PROJECT5 system paper. So if you would like, to contribute to that, that'll be obviously great. Because you have contributed to the paper as well. PERSON8, are you planning to or do already have an Overleaf for the slides, or not yet?",
            "Not yet.",
            "Yeah. So please, send the Overleaf link for the slides as soon as you start with that. The deadline for the recorded, demo is alread it's the 17th of June. And, the idea is that probably PERSON8 will present, that, with s like a screen sharing. Recorded with, little not avatar, but PERSON8's head himself in the corner of the slide. And, we will also try to, include in this video, a demo of the of the system as it is, Live, subtitling some of the videos, that w are planned for demo, for the p for the project officer anyway. So in one of these dry run session, we'll also record what we are delivering. And we'll include it in the, in the IWSLT, presentation. So PERSON8 will share Overleaf, anybody, welcome to contribute. PERSON8, do we know, that we need the contribution from, someone? Like that we don't understand, what's in the paper -",
            "I think it's okay.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay. So that's seems like, we're at the end of the agenda. That will be great. So if you don't have any other questions, or comments, Then I think, everybody should now be, pretty busy with, write up of the deliverables. And we'll we'll have call, so or like urgent calls if anything is, is wrong, But otherwise, I think we are doing good. A number of doodle pools is to come, for the, for offering the slots to the project officer, for the demo. And for the regular dry run sessions, where we will also sort out the technical, Or discuss the technical, things, we've learnt from IWSLT submission. Okay, so we're great.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thanks to everybody. That was very, effective I'm, I'm happy and let's let's proceed like that for the rest of the project.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Thank you. Bye, bye.",
            "Thank you, bye, bye.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye guys.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye."
