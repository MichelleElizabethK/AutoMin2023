            "Yes, you can.",
            "Okey, yes, so I use this - this microphone is no longer usable.",
            "This microphone is the recognisory, the recognition.",
            "Yeah, this works well.",
            "Yeah, so the recognition works wee, but I'm unable to us the microphone for the call itself.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, thank you for joining, I actually assumed that you will be away.",
            "And that's - that's great that we have someone from ORGANIZATION1 -",
            "And, yeah we have we have everyone probably because PERSON4 is not responding.",
            "I emailed him yesterday - oh, okay and -",
            "PERSON4 is responding, okay, so PERSON4 will join a little bit later -",
            "And he won't have headsets.",
            "So, the goal for today will be to get everything money on this full workload,",
            "So PERSON3 and PERSON20, who are here, I can show you, they're behind me -",
            "We are - we are trying to get everything running - on our side, so that we have more interchannels.",
            "And, I think that on your side everything hould be okay, so.",
            "Maybe if, sh should be yeah okay,",
            "So let's first go through the topics in the, in the document.",
            "Hey guys, good morning.",
            "Yep, hi, morning, great.",
            "So, I suggest to first go through the topics in the PROJECT2 document, document, And then do any debugging which is necessary to see - To see what is working and what is not working.",
            "And we also have PERSON4, yeah PERSON4 is free, I guess.",
            "So, the logistics, is - Full Wednesday, is surely avilable.",
            "So that's important for those who're coming here from - from abroad.",
            "We can already get to for - call the whole Wednesday,",
            "And Tuesday afternoon is also very likely.",
            "So please talk to PERSON1 and let her know when you are here.",
            "The real video mixer is ordered an will be there, so this is something that we can experiment with and hopefully we can get it running.",
            "The fingerprints -",
            "Thanks for everybody who contributed and checked this fingerprints map.",
            "Maybe I should start sharing my screen instead of the camera.",
            "So I'll, stop my camera, share my screen,",
            "Hello, yeah, so this fingerprints map. It's now a bit more legible, because it's.",
            "And - PERSON3 is like overseeing this and checking if everything is missing.",
            "I haven't had the time to update the diagram, the sketch, so in essence the - the sheet is -",
            "And this should be the grapf, but we don't have - we don't have the graph.",
            "This is - The graph would take much time to construct.",
            "Okay, so as I said, for today I would really like to see the full workload,",
            "So all of your imputs, and all target languages in the presentation platform -",
            "To see how that behaves.",
            "And I would also like to test those. To switch the -line during someone - Someone's talk.",
            "So, one of the channels should be followed - Should be like recorded, for example.",
            "We can think that this is one of the re-speakers, and, we would like to switch the subtitles to present another source of that language.",
            "So if several imput Englishs, and we would like to switch those.",
            "Yeah, so, everything is going - So, PERSON9 or PERSON8 can you please explain?",
            "Yes sure,",
            "Yeah.",
            "The presentation platform available is not yet updated.",

            "Yeah.",
            "You.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Today.",
            "Support publishing different languages, but they all may be published with using the English as language.",
            "Unfortunately, is not.",
            "As -",
            "I, I, yeah I, yeah.",
            "The voice quality is again not perfect.",
            "So, I hear your voice interrupted at times.",
            "So I thought that for this check we want you to do the switching by killing off the -lines, and using the bridge selecting different bridge worker starting up a different bridge worker and starting up the - The -line again.",
            "So the different bridge would be - would be used and the different path would be selected.",
            "So.",
            "Yes.",
            "For this - for this check today, I wanted to use the setup which you already worked in the past.",
            "Okay, sorry again and thank you.",
            "Yeah, so this - This should - We should be able to test this.",
            "So, maybe - I'll just say, so - Yeah, we're testing the old option, the bridge workers to select the.",
            "Please explain whether the - The planned behaviour for the next week.",
            "Yeah, so, so PERSON9 actually since you are here, you were not here when I was saying that Wednesday is also available for the full guesting at South Premises.",
            "When - And I heard that you are coming, which is great.",
            "So, is that true?",
            "Are you coming?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah I haven't heard you -",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, and, when are you coming?",
            "Are you coming during Wednesday?",
            "So you will be hore - here only on Wednesday evening or even earlier?",
            "I don't.",
            "I have to ask journey.",
            "Yeah, so, so as said, Wednesday is surely available from the very morning and Tuesday afternoon is also extremely likely.",
            "So, if you come already at Tuesday lunchtime, we will make use of all the available very well.",
            "So Tuesday lunchtime would be already sensible arrival, if you can make it.",
            "Okay, I can ask you about.",
            "Yeah,",
            "Okay, okay, I will ask you.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah and than - So, we'll do the testing in the second, once - once PERSON3 is - is - Has put everything together and on, and so on.",
            "What ow - what occured to me as a usable thing is the various thing would be if all the interpreters int he four booths would see their subtitles as the're being recognised.",
            "So for example now if I saw me, if I saw my own English among the - on the subtitles, which, for some reason, does not, yeah - Oh okay, something is being updated and I don't see the actual words.",
            "So, I cannot tune my pronunciation to improve - to improve what is being recognised or how do I - How close am I to the microphone and so on.",
            "So if we are able to provide the interpretors with the immediate feedback, I believe the quality would be much better.",
            "For this, ORGANIZATION5 can bring sufficient laptops, we'll somehow get them, I don't know, wha have four but we will try.",
            "But, we need the setup to - To be there.",
            "So, PERSON4, are you or on the call?",
            "PERSON4, PERSON4, are you here?",
            "Can you hear us?",
            "PERSON4, are you - here?",
            "So let's see if PERSON4 is here.",
            "I want you to doublecheck with PERSON4, whether the - Whether they can still connect formal laptops to the Internet.",
            "Hello, hello.",
            "Yes, we can hear you.",
            "Great, so I am here.",
            "Yeah, so, can you connect for more laptops to the Internet?",
            "I guess that should not be any problem.",
            "I guess it should not, but I don't know about the capacity of the switch, so, yeah, I should check.",
            "Yeah, so the idea is to - to have notebooks also in the interpreters' booths, but we can run into physical limits, maybe there is not enough space on their desk and - and so on.",
            "And. But if we - if we succeed with the physical setup, then - My idea is that in the languages we would also have these specific for languages or fake language labels, which would correspond to the ASR of the individual booths - Like ride away.",
            "And, I have not thought about the details, about the fingerprints, I - I let this to - to PERSON3.",
            "What is my little worry is thay we will actually need yet another for couple of ASR, the corresponding language ASR workers.",
            "But, if we can do it in a different way, it would be better.",
            "So this is like an idea and I would like that PERSON3 and - and PERSON9 or - To discuss how to do this, so that the network load is - is not duplicated again.",
            "So this is, please discuss this a. If you say it's too complicated let's - let's give up on this.",
            "But, if - I thing it would -",
            "My - my only worry is about, let's say, service languages like one two and so on.",
            "You will have - those service languages displayed also in the main page Yeah of presentation platform.",
            "And, so, also - An users will be Yes allowed to choose one of them, and - I don't know if it's suitable or not.",
            "In - in my opinion, Yeah.",
            "I think it's okay, I like I would not worry. Okay.",
            "Maybe - maybe we can lang we can label these special languages only with numbers.",
            "So, maybe call it like X1, X2, X3, X4.",
            "Any idea?",
            "So - so then, no one would be likely to choose it and if they discover and they were like to follow these direct booth channels then why not.",
            "But, like it's not our problem.",
            "So these are only the - the outputs from ASR?",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the idea is - how to set up like a little path out from the main path, which goes through the translation and all that.",
            "The - the little path out directly to - to the presentation platform.",
            "Okay, so let's - let's move forward, so a very relavant thing is that we would - we should try o collect some feedback from the participants.",
            "And wes have only created but not - not yet populated the feedback form.",
            "So if you have any ideas what to ask, simply create a random questions we'll polish this.",
            "Obviously, we will not aks this questions before we actually know how it works.",
            "Like if - if - if it - fails completely, there's no point in asking like Were you happy with translation quality polish - so, we'll only ask the questions that are relevant.",
            "So we'll keep updating this form as we go.",
            "My main Well, actually, Yeah sorry I Yeah, yeah.",
            "We have a lot of questions regarding the user interface, Okay.",
            "The functionalities and - You know there're two maybe presentational platform more comfortable Great for the user.",
            "So we can - put a lot of questions regarding these parts.",
            "Yes, exactly, so k. Feel free to create a new section here or whatever.",
            "Though into form modified as - as - as you like Okey and we'll organise a ORGANIZATION4 form anyone can edit it and, we'll finalise the content of the form actually on Wednesday I suggest.",
            "So that, on - on Thursday we can give it to the participants.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So if anyone would like to know anything about their part, feel free to add such questions in a way that is understandable to - like a - late users.",
            "Yeah, and the last thing I wanted to mention is this video, that we would like to record from - from that, as you know the - the video form the was quite successful at least for u for ourself, I think.",
            "And, this time I have a student journalist, a PhD. student of journalism, so he should be the more skilled.",
            "We are still waiting for the confirmation from ORGANIZATION3, whether they have no objections against this.",
            "And, I think that PERSON4 will not know today, I think that ORGANIZATION3 finally decide only on Monday.",
            "But, anyway, I told the person that we would like, even if ORGANIZATION3 does not hello him to - to go to the premises, that we would still like to do it well outside of the building, or at ORGANIZATION5, or wherever.",
            "So, this is - this is the ORGANIZATION4 document which would be then the content of the video.",
            "And these the journalist never know what to tell you, what they should ask, or what he should tell them, so actually it's up to us to - to propose the propose the content.",
            "They - they will then organise it in a nice way, but we need to suggest what - what should appear in the video.",
            "So, please, if you have any ideas Sorry, just put them there, okay.",
            "The problem is - For the guy is to building or to recover - recall the inside it.",
            "So well the person is avaiable and has the whole day for us, but ORGANIZATION3 needs to approve that he can enter the building, which is - Which they probably allow without any problems, and that he can record and what he can record.",
            "I think there - is many sensible ways how he can record something and still not record any of the participants, and not our inper iterpreters as well.",
            "And we would still like to see these parts of the video, but in general, someone needs to confirm, that - that he can be there with the equipment.",
            "Okay, please let us also know if it's possible to record the something inside the - the building, because maybe we - we can have been providing recording by ourselves, at least some - some scene of the situation and of the booth and so on. Yes, exactly.",
            "Yeah, so video what - what I - what I also have is a - is a - Like a regular camera, big one, that I use at the - at the, so, I also - Well try to - get some material as a background, possible background images.",
            "But obviously, someone has to be fine with that.",
            "Is - A - the - the room Yes, sure is not in the street regime, the - the room, the lecture room, is - You don't need an ID card to enter this room, ehich is different from the normal premises of ORGANIZATION3.",
            "So, if I - when I visit PERSON4 in his offices, I need to show my ID, they record and - and so on.",
            "And - and they double-check that I don't have any knives, and all the security gates.",
            "But, the - the - presentation or the - the workshop room is a normal one.",
            "So it's - it's easier to get there and - But ORGANIZATION3 has to confirm that they are fine with that.",
            "Okay, so Okay.",
            "Is not working, is it?",
            "What is not working?",
            "I am checking my microphone, because - I don't see my name like, so I thought it was broken and now it's finally working We can hear you, we can hear you, okay. So, the thing is, even with the interpreters, there was this requirement for the confidentiality or no disclosure, so I don't think it will be this easy to - get permission to record anything.",
            "Yeah, so the idea is to record like the setting and what we do there, so the wires and an empty room, or interpreter's booth or maybe to watch our participants, The - like the biggest thing would be to watch our participants from behind.",
            "And s. Like. A. Maybe at some point, when there is nothing interesting or where the screen is actually not visible at all.",
            "And the content of the - of what they are talking should not have be in the - in the video.",
            "So we can make, maybe, like.",
            "Yeah, and you will probably meet - also someone disclosure for from the journalists, because he will be there, he will hear stuff.",
            "That's right, so that we can - we can ask him to sign the same thing as the interp. You're right, okay.",
            "So we'll we'll figure this out.",
            "So this is - this is for PERSON1.",
            "Can you email PERSON1, that we need to have - Because what the journalist we cannot simply say that he followed the like code of conduct of interpreters.",
            "Because journalists have different codes of conduct.",
            "So, we'll - we'll have a nondisclosure agreement for - for him as well.",
            "And we can also confirm - I guess the - the regime here is the same as - as with the interpreters.",
            "So it's us who confirms to you, the ORGANIZATION3, that they have signed this non agreement and they will not do any - any bad thing.",
            "And it's our responsibility.",
            "So that's - that's not problem I hope so yeah.",
            "So that's - that's not a problem.",
            "But please since the time is getting short please - Like - Swiftly communicate any - any concerns, so that we can - we can have him there and - and record it.",
            "So in the worse case Yeah, regarding concerns, yeah.",
            "There were even concerns from the participants that the - thing the - things there will be talk - they will be talking about - will - be - well, will leak too soon.",
            "So there are definitely concerns, with the.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, s. Yeah, so well - I thing it's - it's something that we all can sign that we are not going to leak anything and that will be very careful about the data and - all that, but - obviously, yeah you have to decide.",
            "So - so - I don't know, maybe - maybe some of the sessions should be like close.",
            "For us or - I don't know what - what the setup would be.",
            "Yeah, on okay.",
            "So - so PERSON4, your - your microphone is now very well - We - we hear your typing frantically, I guess it's not - Not me, not me. not - Okay.",
            "So someone else anyway, let's.",
            "Is it PERSON11?",
            "Not me.",
            "No - no, I don't know, we hear someone typing very loud.",
            "Yeah, okay, so let's get the experiment running.",
            "I am talking, so I'll now - I'm talking and I'm watching the subtitles.",
            "And, I'm not sure it's - if it's recognising what - what I am saying.",
            "My softer lines of English Yes. is Yes, it's - it's recognising you.",
            "But what is being dispayed in the subtitles is totally wrong.",
            "So if you look at the subtitles it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
            "It was microphone but - I - I touched.",
            "That's reasonable, I would say -",
            "I - I will check what does it listen to Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so maybe we have the problem with the input quality, which can happen all the time -",
            "No it's good.",
            "Yeah, so that's - My voice correctly arise, so not French, Hungary, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Spanish -",
            "So I have the - full set of subtitles, but I don't have - I see only some messy German and some Yes completely broken English, so We still have only two English segmenters so we can run at most two languages at once.",
            "Oh, and we don't have anyone from.",
            "Yes. some day to go.",
            "Yes tody I wrote them email to run ten two segmenters, but they didn't replied.",
            "Yeah, so for now I suggest that we all keep connected to this call and we'll do the debugging an at various places and if you are not debugging at - anything at any point, then - Well - Just keep working on whatever you have to do - Otherwise, but please keep listening in, so that when you have problem we can ask immediately.",
            "And - I'll have to leave for another call in thirty minutes from now, but PERSON3 and PERSON20 will be here and. Another thing that we still have not started debugging is the - is the video - broadcastings, so we should make yourself this opportunity and see - Yeah - if I can - If I can shift the video from Linux mischief for example.",
            "So.",
            "Say it again? German is being is going to be published?",
            "Yes, I - I - I - I turned English off and I started German, Cause I struggled with - plunging English and German at once.",
            "So I am going to rum them separately.",
            "So can we see this somewhere?",
            "Yes, it's PROJECT2.. com.",
            "It's not translation service then.",
            "It is not?",
            "Was a was a question.",
            "This should be using your translation service, right?",
            "I - I am not sure.",
            "I don't think it's logging anything but, is looking for the long files.",
            "Yes, because we have English to German translator from so, I - I think - Okay, that's - you mustn't one.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "But let's - let's try Romanian, because there is only - your Romanian.",
            "We have Romanian?",
            "Oh let's see.",
            "Yes, we have.",
            "Now I started it.",
            "So English I - I - no - no -",
            "PERSON5 say something.",
            "Okay, one, two, three, four.",
            "Okay, I can - What I noticed in the English channel is that I still see a lot of old English subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable -",
            "And I think this is - These words were uttered by me several minutes ago.",
            "So I think it's caching terribly.",
            "PERSON9, can you - can you confirm, can you somehow - Is there a way to flush the cash?",
            "A way to flush where'd the cash be?",
            "Within the presentation platform.",
            "In the protocol there's the - let say flush message, who actually performs the flush of the.",
            "But actu. But and I think that is that there still be incremental transcription problem to be solved out.",
            "And because it - The same phrase is proposed several times, with sl small differences.",
            "Are you working on - on this problem or - or actually with this integration the - Keep the ASR or -",
            "Beside - yeah, we don't just aware we're talking about this the other day and we've forgotten, Partially the same thing actually ASR.",
            "I think explosive the paper and which explains it.",
            "Zigzag.",
            "PERSON13 had some kind of simple caching.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The paper sieze, if I correctly undestand the they maintain the start time the same until the is finalised, And then they a new start time, when it goes on in the press diction.",
            "Yeah, so, PERSON13 - PERSON13 - PERSON13 just said these loging to check this.",
            "Am. I - I think the idea is he logs it to - to determine that it really is the algorithm specified to the paper.",
            "Yes, so he hasn't made any changes, we only noticed the paper yesterday.",
            "Yes so maybe Yes and yes. let's let's copy this link to - the ORGANIZATION4 document, because in it appears in many - In various channels and it's if you - if you it.",
            "But if you are looking at the subtitles at PROJECT2.. com, then the English should be live what from what I - what I'm saying.",
            "So, there should be little or no delay between my words and what and what appears in the English - and - As for now - I - d - like at this point I see the English stuck and no words of mine.",
            "Yes - So fault now.",
            "Okay.",
            "It - it's. Only the Romanian is running, but I can't see any output from it.",
            "Yeah, I - I don't see any output inthe Romanian subtitles either.",
            "So can we somehow debug what is happening?",
            "Where is my speech where it stuck word doesn't get through and why there is nothing in the - in the Romanian.",
            "So how do we diagnose.",
            "I - I asked the ASR workers, they are running or not or if they are available but - not responding.",
            "If I may?",
            "Yes.",
            "The - the very last published message I can se on - Form the publisher is three minutes old now, so no one is publishing right now.",
            "Yeah that's - PERSON3 says that's correct, so, PERSON3, please, let us now, when the publishing will start again and we will re - re things.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON3, should I do the same something?",
            "Should I do the same something?",
            "Who available o the ASR workers, ane For some reason anyone here won't be - in the call.",
            "No one can hear you. Takže máme tam dva.",
            "Hey guys, sorry, may I make a stupid question?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Did we invite?",
            "Because I think that it's really important to have at least PERSON22 and PERSON13 participating this call.",
            "PERSON3 emailed them yesterday and they did not respond to that email at all five minutes ago and didn's respond either.",
            "Okay, so sorry.",
            "So what's the current problem, I'm not sure the ASR's working.",
            "PERSON3, is the ASR working at the moment? Is the ASR working at the moment?",
            "We're there.",
            "People cannot hear you, PERSON3, for some reason And now you can hear me, right? yeah.",
            "Now we - I can - Or I can't share the screen, I - we have there two ASR workers from English, which are available.",
            "And I just minute ago and they should output something, but they don't.",
            "Well I'm not saying anything.",
            "They should be producing something only when I'm talking.",
            "But you're talking it didn't occur - Yeah I'm talkin now.",
            "And there's going nothing hitting the MT server.",

            "And if it's - Say something PERSON5.",
            "Yes, one, two, three, four Yeah. one, two, three, four.",

            "Sorry guys, anothers question - Did we use the send the audio in the march fair?",
            "Or we use a different client.",
            "We was the same EB-client.",
            "Okay.",
            "So now, here we can see - that we have two - two ASR wors workers, but here - yeah - Let's see how many segmenters.",
            "Okay so we run out of segmenters.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sector two texts.",
            "There is only one English segmenter and it's not available, but two German.",

            "So, I'll try ehmto mute myself to keep hearing myself when I'll be talking to the other call, but that - What we rarely happening is ELG.",
            "So PERSON11, the first agenda is metaphorum and I said that there in the list it appears PROJECT2 most likely - ORGANIZATION1 and your name was a question mark.",
            "Okay, yeah that - that's - that should be okay.",
            "Yeah, exactly, so at this point Yeah. I think it's okay.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So you're not on the call, are you?",

            "Yeah, okay. And,",
            "Probably he's going to metaphorum too, but - I can ask him Yeah. to look after it later.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so -",
            "Sorry guys, what we are going to test right now?",
            "Yeah, is - is the testing still going on?",
            "Because, we should probably actually drop off reasonably soon.",
            "Well, On PERSON5 does, but PERSON3, are you still there?",
            "I can see some - traffic - hitting a translation servers.",
            "PERSON9, do you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Well, this is probably not the perfectc time, but I'd like to raise the point of incriprion, that it would be nice to have - On the - on the presentation interface to have the HTTPS mandatory at least.",
            "But it's not mandatory, but at the moment the HTTPS should work.",
            "Yes, that's correct, because for the at least for the event it would be nice to have it mandatory, probably with some - at least a simple password.",
            "Because if it's -",
            "At the moment, we haven't had any requirements for user authentication, but we willing to use it in the next versions, not for this event, sorry.",
            "Oh, then I'm not sure if you'll be able to use it, that - that's bad.",
            "Hi, this is PERSON20, PERSON3 is having some trouble with the connecting the Internet. We - we will join soon - like -",
            "Okay, actually there is problem in managing user's data.",
            "For the GDPR, and - the requires much more deep reasoning about - on how to store user data.",
            "PERSON4, what's your - your point?",
            "Did you understand the problem?",
            "Doubt, can you repeat?",
            "Actually, there's a problem in for storying a used data.",
            "And we require much more deep reasoning about it and this is the reason why in this version of this presentation platform we didn't store any data.",
            "Neither username and password that they -",
            "Oh, we donť need a participant username and password, one password for the whole call will be sufficient.",
            "And no usernames are needed, just something to prevent anyone from anywhere to listen in.",
            "Okay, I understand, I can ask you to, but, actually, it was not planned.",
            "Can you hear me now?",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Hello, I apologise for - yeah.",
            "For not saying it earlier, I hope you will be make - Able to make just the most basic things.",
            "Okay, I cannnot promise it but we will work - we will start work on it as soon as possible.",
            "So now we should see French subtitles from English source from one recording from last year - workshop.",
            "But I can's see any output.",
            "So what's happening?",
            "I first tried the segmenter, English segmenter.",
            "Nothing -",
            "There may be an error in the segmenter.",
            "From English to English.",
            "I work out and have a look at.",
            "Yes, I can't get any output from segmenter but I get it from ASR.",
            "PERSON4?",
            "I aske d the. O that say super general authentication on the platform developer.",
            "And they pulled me that actually it's - it's easy to do things we already reason about it and it's available for the, okay?",
            "Okay, thank you very much for the good news.",
            "Yes I am so happy to know it.",
            "Yeah, seems that - that one segmenter is running but the second one is not running.",
            "I doesn't output anything.",
            "What do you mean by second segmenter?",
            "I - I launched two instances of ebclient, two identical ones, one was from NEU-lecture hybrid, into NEU text, and it doesn't output anything, and the second one was the same and it -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Now I can connect or do you just get an no output.",
            "I got - I'm getting no output from the first one.",
            "And it's connected.",
            "Yeah, and, the second instance can't connect at all at this moment, but - yeah - Oh - wait - wait - Now it's connected and it's outputting - The text,",
            "Which seems that there's the - the same ASR but sometimes it doesn't output anything.",
            "But is avai. But seems available.",
            "So I am - I right now have ten instances of this running all off putting hard files I - I don't even know which one you're connected to.",
            "Because it's - I could see you with this producing output because then it's writing something to the logs.",
            "But it's not producing output, then I can look at logs - is - Yes. not producing output.",
            "Yes. if you can connect and you - It say you get up pipeline then there should be definitely output if there is input.",
            "So, the problem might be - that - maybe the audio is not sent correctly.",
            "It sure be sent - right.",
            "Because when I try un text instead of text, send it to - ASR - now.",
            "Sorry, I think I'm gonna drop off this call, I can see that there - Will we get text through hits the empty workers, our empty workers, but obciously we haven't to stress them yet.",
            "Yes. I - I'm not sure, if you - Yeah I'm again we off contact for an hour or two.",
            "But try some slack anyway.",
            "Is actually - Okay. is actually flyingtoday so don't think you'll be in touch.",
            "But - Okay, thanks. he a. Sorry about that, now I - I should - I should leave now.",
            "Okay, good luck for the debugging.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "PERSON11 -",
            "Bye.",
            "Sorry, PERSON3?",
            "I asked Yes. the possibility the - In the previous afternoon and probably it's not possible, I'm sorry.",
            "What is not -",
            "For us, for pre-voice to be there in the previous afternoon.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yes, so you can arrive on Wednesday?",

            "Yes I can hea. Yes I can her you.",
            "I - I'm - I'm going to - My - microtest script with a test case and - and upload it to the crise control repo.",

            "Okay, have you talked - We - About the bridge fingerprints, we.",

            "And, have you found an agreement in order to - to find these tools language?",
            "In order to correctly populate the presentation platforms source language part?",
            "Yes, we - we use the bridge workers.",
            "So we want change the publishing workers but we -",
            "Okay, But we - start the bridges. is it.",

PERSON5 is not here, so I'm not sure whether he will be joining today, but maybe he will, remotely. And other than that I think that's that's everyone. So we can probably start. Yeah, so. So let's see. Yeah, we can we can start with the PROJECT3 I guess, because PERSON6 can provide feedback, right?",
            "But I'm not sure whether I should talk about it, when. PERSON11 is not here.",

It seems like he should be ready, but he didn't send me a message or anything, so I don't know. So yeah, PERSON5 is here. Yeah okay so let's let's keep the PROJECT5 and PROJECT3 right now, since PERSON11 is not here and maybe do we have some updates on the PROJECT7?",

            "Yeah, ye. But it's just to. To I don't know, maybe writing things, we can think about alternatives or limitations. And so it will be interesting to, to check this kind of thing so. So far I just organize the sections in bullet points.",

            "Yeah.",

            "North American, yeah. So, we can try this one if.",
            "Yeah this seems, this seems reasonable.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "One thing that I need to say is that I'm.",
            "PERSON5, told us about the data set that has multip multi-reference. So, it will be useful if I can access it.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So I'll try to dig it out, I. It's one of those is. So what languages, that's the question. We have a data set of very many Czech reference translations. To just 50 source English source sentences. So f we have only 50 unique English sentences and each of those was equipped with as many references as people could come up with. And it was created semi-automatically. So we have like quarter mil quarter million reference translations per one sentence. That's the that's the biggest one I think we have. So several dozen thousand references, per sentence. That is common. And it's small in the number of sentences, that we have. And, we have evaluations from PROJECT6 as well, where people were creating. So they actually the system outputs were manually post-edited and then someone else, a secondary annotator, confirmed whether they are good translation or not. And that's, if I'm not mistaken about six hundred unique source sentences. And they have, something between two or, up to sixteen reference translations. That's English to Czech. O both of these are English to Czech. And then we also have, some year of PROJECT6, where the German was translated directly into Czech. So the, we have multiple Czech versions and they are slightly sl like different, because they come from different languages. From English as well as from German. And then there is the HYTER data set, which is 50 Arabic and 50 Chinese sentences and each of these were translatek into English again, trying to create as many references as possible. So please think about which of these data se. I'll send you all. But think a-bout which composition of the of the data set is the most useful for you.",
            "Y okay, great. Yeah. So I can check and choose the best one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Thank you.",
            "I. Yeah.",
            "Okay, so yeah. I also want maybe since. Okay. Since the. Without PERSON11, we cannot really proceed that much with other tasks, can we can we talk about the possible weekly meetings for the task? It's 3.4? Like the same one we had last week, so, where we can we can discuss the things in more detail. Like whe I'm not sure whether you, PERSON5 and PERSON8 you are more comfortable with weekly or bi-weekly meetings, but I think, the task shoulds definitely, have like separate, designated meeting for these detailed discussion, right?",
            "Well I'm I'm available w. Every day and don't know, I'm I'm, you, you s you dec you decide it, what is the best date for that. Day or if it will be weekly or.",
            "Okay, so let's let's leave it to PERSON5, because he's he's the most busy person. So oh whatever he suggests, we can we can then, try to put it as a as date. Okay. Other than that, yeah. I was I was mentioning to you PERSON8 that we might reduce the daily meetings, but that was good point from PERSON5, that the daily meetings should be. Or daily meetings. The daily reports or calls should be also beneficial in a way, that you're more socialized with the, with the rest of the team, or at least with some of people. So yeah. We may keep those and just keep them, keep them short if necessary and, like stay s let's stay with the daily calls for the time being. At least until you are, until it is possible for you to come visit LOCATION1, right?",
            "Sure, sure. No problem.",
            "Okay. So yeah. I think that's probably everything for PROJECT7, right? Because, well there was a meeting last St Thursday and I think we covered, everything we need. Yeah. So yeah I'm not sure, like since PERSON11 is still not replying, whether he will make it, And if we don't have anything else to discuss, we can probably, end this call for today, right, PERSON5?",
            "Yeah.",
            "And I can.",
            "Yeah. I'm going to dig out the data sets for PERSON8.",
            "Okay. And I can I c I can ask PERSON11, talk with him about the progress, in person, later this week. But yeah. I think, yeah, if I'm correct like we got the response or PERSON12 already wrote an e-mail to the ORGANIZATION3 people but they, didn't reply yet, right? Or at least, I didn't receive any e-mail from them. PERSON8, you also didn't receive any reply for the PERSON12's e-mail?",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Nothing yet. Still waiting.",
            "Okay. Okay. I don't think we need to like urge them or push them to for replying yet, right? But, yeah let's keep that in mind.",
            "And I have a quick update for PERSON6 on something totally different.",
            "And that's on the experiment with ORGANIZATION2. So we had a meeting with PERSON10 and PERSON7 on Friday and also PERSON1 and the. Essentially, the nothing new was discussed and like agreed on at the meeting. Only that we are formally starting with that thing, and they should find translators, and the overall budget available is lower than we were hoping for, but. So now they will come up with some number of translators to do the post-editing, and the price, and this will give us an estimate on the total number of sentences we can, dew. And f. I would like to ask PERSON6 to do the, proposal how to divide the documents into these s into the annotation like recipes again. And then we will discuss with PERSON7, whether this coverage will be sufficient, so that we would trust the numbers or whether we would somehow have to do it differently. So.",
            "Okay, but should I now just wait for the number of sentences -",
            "Maybe it would be good if you could just ping PERSON7 if they are moving, because they want this fast, but they still have not provided the people. So it would be, good if.",
            "Well I wrote some e-mails, but I got no reply. Or, mostly no reply. It was.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It was confusing, cause I thought that they wanted it really fast, but then it stalled for like.",
            "Yeah, exactly, and then they are failing. So that's that's that's common. That's normal. Like it's.",
            "Great. Okay.",
            "Yeah, so maybe just tell them, that I told you that it's it's proceeding and that we are essentially waiting for them to tell us the number of people and the number of segments we can afford. And.",
            "Okay.",
            "Once we have the number of unique people and the number of segments in total that we have funding for, we can propose the set of documents, to discuss if we are fine with that.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we need we need the constraints, the outside constraints from them.",
            "Great.",
            "I'll look at them, today.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Okay, so maybe one more thing, yea. It is mentioned in the document that like yeah. Still we are waiting for the, ORGANIZATION7 to actually do their part of the work and they have problems obviously to get, volunteers. Is there any. It's this is question for PERSON5. Are ther do we have any other options, or? Like. The thing is that the experiment is taking way too long and it's being suspended too long and maybe it's good idea to think about.",
            "The issue is that we don't have any native English speakers on our faculty.",
            "Okay.",
            "And we already use those foreigners that speak English not, natively but, at least with some accent. Use those for the 2B experiment.",
            "Okay, so yeah. Okay so this is the best we can do right now. Okay. That it's fine.",
            "Okay but I would like to ask PERSON5 whether there is some way to, make some, more formal complaint about this? Because.",
            "To whom, sorry? Sorry, I'm.",
            "I don't know, just I feel like ORGANIZATION7's seriously dropped the ball on this project. And.",
            "Oh -",
            "So the thing is that -",
            "PERSON11 and I are very frustrated.",
            "Yeah, we can probably ask PERSON12. But the problem is that PERSON4 is taking care of this and he will be leaving the project and.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Maybe it would be good idea to ask who is taking over, and start, bothering the other person with this.",
            "Yeah I'm I'm afraid I'm afraid that PERSON12 will only say that he is starting to hire someone. So, yeah. The short message is something which I was telling at the very beginning. So we should, count on the option that they totally fail to deliver anything useful. I think I mentioned that loud in the very beginning, so. And it's always like that, yeah, it's it's unfortunately the general rule of life, so if you are searching for a helping hand, you will always find it at the end of your shoulder. And that's that's it, so. Like just don't don't be, depressed, but. So they are expected to provide the speakers and they are, like failing, right?",
            "Yeah. And. So maybe ask PERSON12 to simply, have someone do the simplest thing, just to forward that, those e-mails and get those speakers. So that we, we do not expect them to, do the evaluation much, but we just expect them to provide the, the users to the to the test. So that the task is easier for PERSON12 to accomplish even with people leaving.",
            "So one thing, the advertisement is.",
            "Hi guys.",
            "Hey. So the advertisement for the PROJECT3 is new, or not? This, wasn't available last week, right?",
            "It was.",
            "Oh, okay. But you know, I've looked at the website and it seems, like, it is progre. But I'm not sure how old that advertisement is.",
            "Well, the issue is that we already agreed to do, to do the writing and so on. But.",
            "Okay.",
            "But I don't know what exactly I should write into the paper, because we already had ten people do this experiment, which is five times more than what we already have from ORGANIZATION7 and.",
            "What other, findings should I do there?",
            "Like what other graphs, what other.",
            "Yeah, I guess we can still try. Or.",
            "I can PERSON9 step in? Like PERSON9 should have, the expertise in context, to do it quickly.",
            "Yeah, I think you sh you should definitely try asking PERSON12, like what are the other options, right? Because PERSON12 should be, should know who else is there except for, PERSON4, right? Working on the.",
            "So I'll I'll write an e-mail to PERSON12 right now and hopefully something will happen.",
            "So now we are discussing the like.",
            "PROJECT3. The lack of activity.",
            "Yeah, yeah, y okay. And in conjuctio in conjunction with PERSON4 leaving?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "But yeah, they's bas that's basically, everything there's to discuss about PROJECT3 right now, right? So, so, I don't know PERSON11, can you can you, just do a quick update for the PROJECT5? It seems that you know, it's progressing, right? So?",
            "Yeah, so like.",
            "That's.",
            "I'm running the back translation, monolingual data. So during the last week when I, ta took vacation, I was just baby sitting the jobs. And like many people started to do experiments on GPUs, so it's, it's slowed down a bit. So it's still not ready and yeah. As a miracle after I, I wrote you, the message, I got many GPUs available, I don't know, how it's possible, PERSON3.",
            "Because I was killing some jobs today.",
            "Yeah. Okay so now we'll like. I think in, two or three days, like if, if the tempo is the same, remains the same, I should have all the data translated. And then I can, train, the systems with this monolingual or back translated data included.",
            "And, just today I noticed that the AC ORGANIZATION6 deadline, was shifted to, October 7th I guess. So there is still some time to like hopefully to finish it.",
            "Yeah, I think I think that's.",
            "Or at least to train a systems with all the data, all the monolingual data, just to see whether it helps or not with this monolingual data included.",
            "Okay, so that seems fine.",
            "Yeah, as for as for PERSON2's contribution, it's still lower and lower.",
            "Okay. Well. He will be leavings, for ORGANIZATION7 next week, right? I think?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Well if you need some technical help, let me know, I can probably chip in.",
            "Okay.",
            "And maybe last thing PERSON5, there is I've I've noticed that there is a system demonstration tract in ORGANIZATION6. Do w do we want to participate with something, for example with PROJECT3, or I don't know. Like it would be nice dissemination, it would be, good -",
            "That's right, so they. S the web page for the call or the call for demos was empty, and is still it is still empty.",
            "Okay.",
            "So if you look at if you look at, where is the chat window, at this, link, it doesn't specify the deadline yet. I've already e-mailed one of the chairs, conference chairs and he has contacted the demo chairs and they said they will fix it. So some deadline will appear and we are planning to use this for PROJECT4 demo p submission. I think that doing also PROJECT3 demo submission would be a good thing. PROJECT3 is open source and it is like interesting piece of, software, like interesting user interface for experimenting, so yes, it's, it's a good idea. But we don't know the deadline.",
            "Should it be. Should it be accompanied with a paper, or it's just the demonstration?",
            "It's. I think it's always a paper, well I always expect a.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I always expek a four a four-page paper.",
            "Okay, because now we are like, now we are, releasing the pape or publishing the paper for PROJECT1, so okay w, we can maybe somehow make, a like shorter version of it. Or somethn. Because we have nothing else, or nothing more to, to publish.",
            "Well I think I think for the demonstration it should be focused more on the on the framework itself, right, not on the, experiment results. So.",
            "Yeah, but it is it is already enough for the PROJECT1 paper, like.",
            "Okay. Well it's it's just the that to keep that in mind, it would definitely give us some bonus points with the reviewers later, right. To have, these submissions. So yeah. I, I think that's it for today, right? Is there anything else? Or PERSON11, you want to, discuss?",
            "Okay, so just to recap what's going on with that PROJECT3. So, PERSON5 is going to write to PERSON12, just to manage things in ORGANIZATION7, yeah?",
            "Yeah, I've I've emailed PERSON12 already. Second ago.",
            "Okay. Okay. And sorry, and have you discussed like our capabilities of disseminating this advert? Because I know. Yeah, okay.",
            "Like we are looking for native English speakers, how are we supposed to disseminate this?",
            "Yeah. I don't know, maybe the same channels as we found new employees for PROJECT4 and yeah. Yeah, I know like I'm really dissatisfied with this and I know that, this should be.",
            "But are we supposed to. I. Do we get Engli native English speakers, via this channel?",
            "Maybe. But we don't need native English speakers, we need somebody who doesn't know any Czech or any Estonian.",
            "Okay.",
            "Or like native English speakelr would be perfect, but.",
            "Just a question.",
            "But yeah, I'm I agree that this is the duty for ORGANIZATION7 and yeah. They promised it, to get the people and they have like the best, best environment, or like, best conditions to do it. In England, or sorry, in Scotland.",
            "But I think this is not our problem, problem, right?",
            "Yeah, but we are the leaders of this project and.",
            "Oh okay.",
            "Like and PERSON6 is leaving or, and so.",
            "We would like to, to have this like piece of, work published. So.",
            "Yeah, I'm happy to see that PERSON11 is not as depressed as I understood from what PERSON6 was saying, so yes, exactly, this is the approach that you should be taking. I've emailed PERSON12, feel free to add as a reply whatever nasty words you like and whatever important reasons, such as PERSON6 is leaving, that's that's very important reason. But yes, in the end, we need to help ourselves. So that's.",
            "Yeah. I'm not depressed, because I'm after a one week vacation, so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I'm not yet depressed.",
            "Okay, so, well we've got that covered, we'll see what PERSON12 will, do. And let's. Leaving that aside, anything else? Needing discussing? So, I guess that we've discussed everything we needed so we can, like end it here right, for today?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "Okay, great. Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thanks to all. Thank you, buh bye.",
            "Okay, bye.",
            "Thank you, bye.",

            "Hi.Yeah.",
            "Hi.",
            "How are you.",
            "Yes. So, are we missing anyone? We have all partners present show I. If people so. Thanks for coming. This call should be quick, hopefully. There is nothing that I would know about that we need to discuss, like in a very big detail. So let's get started. And if other people join then, well, they can tell us further for the details. So what is my first question is to PERSON6. After we have had the call on Monday, what is the proposed development schedule. And when there could be some preliminary some prototype implementation that we could test. So if we have PERSON6 on the call. I saw her. But her camera is disabled and I don't know if she can speak. So we see PERSON7 joining as well. So PERSON6 are you on the call? Or maybe she still yeah never mind. So let's wait for PERSON6. And we also, do we have PERSON10 Here are not yet.",
            "Yeah, I'm here, I'm here with.",
            "Yep. Okay. Great. So PERSON10 what is the status of the PROJECT3 worker? Because last week, you've said that he you will dust off your. And how promising or problematic does it look now?",
            "Okay, so. According make some steps so far. So the plan is will be ORGANIZATION1 welcome, will be PERSON1, and in-between will be Python Sorrow that's excepts sentences for translation from the ORGANIZATION1 worker. And so ORGANIZATION1 worker workable will probably just be forwarding requests. So this Python based which would I do preproccessing and he can handly many, yeah, not so well the logic, where need to be dealing with partial sentences, but -",
            "Yeah.",
            "With partial sentences and then will forward the requester onto the PROJECT3 server yourself. So a very basic Python based, so to do the preprocessing and received request so yet - for translations forward and post him back. But I haven't started on the actual ORGANIZATION1 worker yourself.",
            "But that should be Feli easy to do that. Because I think they probably even have something like that in the SLT ORGANIZATION3 repository. Did you call some translation system simply by pipe as well? So, I think the there should be almost ready ORGANIZATION1 worker available.",
            "Okay, yes and also the empty worker.",
            "Probably I need to be some little bit adaptation for what I'm doing anyway.",
            "Yeah. So that looks good. So I think that next week for example, you should know whether this proof of concept worked, or what do you have running to any issues.",
            "Yeah, and we can start thinking about the tricky.",
            "Yeah, so for partial sentences, I think that they should be treated from the PROJECT3 prospective as simple simply a different sentences, other sentences that we expected to process. So. So the ORGANIZATION1 worker should send every segment to PROJECT3 for translation. And that's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON8 does not see any difference. Assuming that the PROJECT3 model would be trained to work reasonably well.",
            "Hi, guys. Sorry. I had some problem with the internet connection.",
            "Yeah. No problem. Nice. Glad that you're here. Partial sentences. Okay. One thing that I would still like to know PERSON10, is the handling of timestamps. Handling of timestamps. So this is something that needs to be carefully checked, because timestamps will be later on important for the presentation platform. And we need to we need to know where to start overwriting. And PERSON8's guess is that the worker should work well with timestamps and totaly hide them from the Python and PROJECT3. So I think that to like the timestamps should not go to the Python server at all,",
            "Okay.",
            "But that's my guess. And the limitation with this approach is that we can handle only like one single timestamp at the beginning and would be the end of the segment. But we don't have any finer information. So the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or. Is that problem. So this is something for PERSON6 to know about. And think how if these two timestamps and string comparison are sufficient for the presentation. ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Sorry, PERSON8, I didn't get the point.",
            "Yeah. So they we have discussed this on in the Monday call. How do we present partial translations and partial output. And how do we make sure that the updates are reasonably well displayed. So for updates you don't want to repeat everything. And I think that we had something like the textfiled. Yeah.",
            "Sorry, At the presentation platforms must arrived only what we want to publish. So, the.",
            "Yes.",
            "Let's say PROJECT3 out of the incremental updates must be done.",
            "New one. I thought that our agreement on Monday was different. And that the basic unit that you send to the presentation platform is called a textfield content. So, but then the textfield content can be sent several times as an update. And then at some point somehow there will be made a decision that let's move on to the next textfield. And at that point the presentation platform would like scroll it up, and it would again start displaying whatever comes as full textfield. It will be a replacing the content of the of the textfield with the new messages. So this would be the partial sentences gradually expending gradually longer and longer sentences. And then again at some point the this would be like most scrolled up. And another set of updates would be coming.",
            "No, the presentation platforms is just presentation here. So it wil update the text incoming messages. But the incoming messages must be exactly what we want to be displayed on the on the subtitle. Will not be implemented any logic to manage the partial hypoteses and partial translation output.",
            "But the scrolling the history of previous texts fields would that be supported?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes. So when do you decide whether the textfield should be replaced or scrolled up?",
            "Based on messages. A new message is a new subtitle to be displayed and it can subtitute the biggest one or update the let's say the button of the textfield in order to let.",
            "Yes, So in other words yes part of the message that the presentation of platform is receiving is an indicator, whether this is an update. So replace the current field, or this is a new text field move the history up and populate the field with this new content, right?",
            "I believe they. We treaty exactly at the same way. Each message is intendent we new subtitle.",
            "Aaa, that's bad. That '-",
            "That's just whether of presentation if we want to completly replace and use the history, Or that we history scroll up.",
            "Yeah, I still we. I think we need to discuss this again a fresh call. So, so PERSON8 needs to discuss with PERSON6 the updates versus history of text fields. Yeah. So well once we discussed this. I think that we'll arrive at the solution where the timestamp of the beginning would be the critical information. And as long as the timestamp is the same, the field should be replaced with the new content. And if the timestamp is higher than the current the last text field should be like move to the history and closed. And we would be displaying the contents from this timestamp on. I think the starting timestamp would be the critical point.",
            "I suggest to discuss again about it.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, for PERSON10 I don't think there is anything changes. But we will let you know if we see something like that. So PERSON6 when you were fighting with your network connection, I had one question on you. And that was the development schedule for the presentation platform after we have discuss it on Monday. So, would there be any prototype available. At a work point would there be any prototype avalaible?",
            "There's no prototype available at the moment, I'm sorry.",
            "Yes, that's expected. I would not expect any prototype today.",
            "Okay. But when would do you have one?",
            "Last time I discuss about it the first prototype presentable should be at the 15th of June. I know it's realy close to our deadline, but this is the only information I have that. Of course we can on work on our let's say raw prototype.",
            "Yes, yes, so.",
            "Probably the development team have something close to be fine advertial to use as prototype, but we can have some working maybe for. I don't have any other information.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So yes, I would really like to see let's finish prototype sooner. So that to me like find whatever problems are there as soon as possible.",
            "Yes, I understand.",
            "Yeah, okay. Great, so another question that I have and that's maybe for ORGANIZATION3 if. So who we have from ORGANIZATION3, only PERSON11. So maybe PERSON11 would not would not like have the power to decide this. Do we plan to run any ORGANIZATION2 workers in LOCATION1, so especially the ASR the ASRs of English and other things as a fall back solution. And also this could be relevant to the ORGANIZATION2 calls with live subtitling. We have not. We have decided not to use the ORGANIZATION2 platform today, because we are still checking some of the recording qualities. And we have people here with Linux machines only. But essentially ORGANIZATION2 is very far in the implementation. So they are able to connect to the ORGANIZATION1 platform and then the whole chat window is flooded with the messages not enough workers available. So I thought that it would be interesting, maybe good idea to start as many workers as possible at in ORGANIZATION3. And if there is some hardware limits, we can also run some from here. So that's that's why I'm asking this clones of alpha workers to run in LOCATION1. PERSON11, would you would you have any idea, if this is easy to do of interest and useful. And so on? Ty I only more worker and now is sexteen or fifteen worker ASR, who are close connected. It's one thing. And second thing are not sure about that wayteh. It will we have the platform. I will have the and whether we can start I think it maybe ok. And it be can view some no voice and somewhere I think it is okay we also other things. So our thing is okay.",
            "Yeah, okay. So is good that there that many workers now, so I actually suggest that we try after this c. This part of the call to switch to the ORGANIZATION2 platform, at least with some of us those who are interested, And we could see how that works with the workers available. So I would like to make use of that you spend some time to run them. So I would be curious myself to see how that works if the workers are available. Okay, so the summary is that ORGANIZATION3 will prepare an image, And ORGANIZATION4 will try to get that running. Yeah. Ok, but. But since you are able to provide sixteen workers, and it is not too big burden for you, right? Sixteen workers it's okay. You can do it like whenever we like and then for them. Yeah?",
            "Now I think we need to sets worker with. Also I have the things I'm and the things running on the same. So, yeah, some we stand when we need more worker I think we have to stop limit number workers.",
            "Yeah. So what is what is. So sixteen is already not comfortable for you?",
            "I have been check it carefully I. Yeah because we have the limit number. And maybe that it the same time. Working at the same time maybe. Like we have the. I mean it is one list internet with, And the also from memory or. Limit number to memory also.",
            "Okay, So yes. So in the long-term, it would be useful to have this image spread out for the various reasons that you mentioned, for the workshop itself we should be good. Okay. Yeah. So it's the priority of this image is not high. And so the. There is no real rush with this image. I would say. So I think that we should be fine relying on, but that's please talk to PERSON3, what he thinks, because in some early stage we discuss that for just for a backup purposes. It would be better to have this. To have two sides providing the workers. So ask PERSON3 agrees that backup sides of ASR workers is very. Well sensible thing to do. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you very much. And after the call I'll reboot to windows. And I'll see if I can connect that room. If I see the workers. So whoever is curious on the presentation, Please use the ORGANIZATION2 link, well. PERSON5 if you could find this ORGANIZATION2 link and aaa and posted here. Yeah. To be tested with ORGANIZATION2 after this call, and here'll be the oral. Yep. Platform is ready. So PERSON2 are you here? We have, I seen you but I cannot hear yet. So once PERSON2, can speak? Hopefully we will learn where when we will be getting the files for domain adaptation and so on. Yes, PERSON2, was that you? That was someone. Yeah, ASR worker the bug. So this is this is probably something that PERSON4 added.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So what-ehm. Have we seen another situation? I know that in the call yesterday, with ORGANIZATION2 the workers worked at the beginning. But at the end of the call it seemed that there are totally know available worker. So it seemed like that during the, the session yesterday. The workers have one by one died out.",
            "Yeah. I didn't attend the yesterday meeting, but the bug that I mentioning is that sometimes the work, one worker can handle several sessions, but then it's, but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.",
            "So, and when you see say several session you mean consecutive ones like one after another.",
            "Yes. It seems that it's it's available. But in fact he doesn't output anything. So. Ty Yeah. I will us, but yesterday so yeah I don't know what is happening there, because we when I do know what prophones it was able to handling several sessions. And that I think it in one sentence it yeah output and I can't fancy call but it was in call, So I have no idea, I think I- This is a I think I had to information and then maybe I can hopefully I can see the one simply wrong come from.",
            "Yeah. So I think it's. It's very important PERSON11 that you create a script that will like replicate it this bug. So that you will maybe set up, maybe there could be a set up support ORGANIZATION1 mediator, and you would connect only one worker to this mediator and.",
            "Our only support input fingerprint. Or in.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So use as input fingerprint and keep like loading importer or keep requesting ASR from one copy. One instance of your worker. In a script. Do it with offline it we have the same problem with offline ASR. So not only online ASR. So do it with offline ASR. As and as soon as the worker stops responding. And I don't know. So, so this script is should be like a stress test, and you can put it to the cruise control repository. And then most importantly you need to run it and figure out where the problem is and then the bucket, but. Yeah.",
            "Okay. Of course. If there is anything we can do in order to help you the publing the problem, we stand us careful the mediator to test just your worker for some. Or anything else we are avalaible.",
            "And a single worker and stress test it yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you. The production client. Yeah, so this is from PERSON4.",
            "Yes. That this point the production client is different from the simple one only by a by. I change only the default parameters and comment send documentations, and I removed to Windows version. So is it okay for everyone? That we don't need to support Windows version of the client.",
            "For us is fine. Also Linux based the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, Okay, yes, And then the text client. That's also the same ebclient or not?",
            "Yes, it's it's it's also. No if you click on this on this test that it's different script. But it's also from the from the sample. It's the same as in the sample and it didn't for me this week. I wrote email to PERSON6 and PERSON11 and PERSON9. I didn't get any replies. So. If can you look at it.",
            "Yes. So.",
            "May I ask you to for one it's to be?",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "Sorry.",
            "I write you again.",
            "PERSON4 will resend the email. Yeah. So. PERSON6 and PERSON9, yeah.",
            "But I'm not sure if PERSON9 is the rigt persons for it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Can you confirm PERSON11? Who is responsible for MT clients on your side.",
            "You mean the person? I think.",
            "Yes.",
            "PERSON9 is working for the MT.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I will, I will try.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you. So the last point, is, the schedule. Well this is all the weeks. So we have up to four calls. And then we already have the workshop, so is anybody, does anybody know that they are not able to make it to the, since, the same time, an hour earlier than today on Fridays? If you have any problems with these calls. And if there is more people who though problem, please put it in the in the document here, and we will find a slightly different hour. But I think that in general we just need to synchronize. So we don't always need everybody. Yeah and seeing the workshop dates. Is anybody planning to come to LOCATION1? Last time, you didn't respond. So if you are starting to, to plan it, Please let us know.",
            "I will not be there, sorry, I hope be more useful here in Trento checking blogs and everything.",
            "Okay. Okay,",
            "But I can be with you with my heart.",
            "PERSON6 to support us remotly. Yeah. Okay, so, I think it's still too early to solid final lists are in the MT models. This is what was kind of plan for today. I don't have any other comments or questions now, So I'm going to reboot. And I'll try to lodge the ORGANIZATION2. You can try launching it in the meantime yourself, if it works for you, if you are all Windows already. And if you don't connect to ORGANIZATION2. Then thanks lot. And will be in touch and speak to you next week. Next Friday.",
            "Okay, bye.",

            "Yeah, ok. So maybe I'll move to recordings here. Yeah, so there is the chat window is being filled with failures of the ASR clients. Yes, so we can close the, close the chat windows. Thanks for joining. I've, as I said, I've emailed PERSON8, if PERSON8 would be joining as well. I don't see any response from him yet. So we can anyway start with the, with the document. With the quick overview. These-This call is being recorded and there is no way to switch it off. So if you were not happy with that we would have to choose a different platform. But I hope that you are fine with that. And also, I don't think there is any way to switch off your webcams in the ORGANIZATION2, unless you simply like put a ducktape over ovet them. That's, yeah. I don't know that's politics of ORGANIZATION2 training. So thanks PERSON6 for joining as well. And let's quickly walk through the document. So the updates on components. I would like to hear from everyone what they are working on and what's the status. And for the presentation platform by PERSON15 and colleagues. I was curious. If you actually had a little video presentation, html client that I could test these streaming off slides with.",
            "Not yet, sorry. But actually, I see the presentation platform slowly taking its form. And I hope briefly we can have raw example of its structure and working.",
            "Next week, we can see something. I don't know exactly when. But actually I've seen something which stopped working.",
            "Yeah, ok. That's very good. And is there also some text only a client or text only version that was simply emit the subtitles to standard output. Because this could be useful for connecting to other unexpected ways of presenting. And I'm asking because as a fallback, we could use like terminal window. In some cases. And also, there is a chance of having the real video mixers that you know about. So last Friday, we tested at ORGANIZATION1 premises. And there will be probably real video mixer available for the three days or two days of the workshop. So if anybody is willing to or curious to play with this, please come to LOCATION1. That's another invitation.",
            "PERSON2 also propose me another option for the main stage presentation problem in order to present subtitles without the presentation platform in order to. But I have to investigate it little bit, maybe we can find different solution.",
            "Yeah, so you're not yet working or-Yeah. I think that having a text client would be useful also for debugging. So if anything comes out that is also as a side effect that is also text client, it would be very useful. So you have already provided numerous sample ways of examples how to run various clients. So having this also for the presentation is what we would like. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, we can reason about it.",
            "So that's in general this is good news that you're proceeding well. So then the PROJECT1 worker, PERSON5.",
            "Ok, so I mentioned last time the way this would work is that would be the PROJECT1 server, ORGANIZATION7 worker and in between a Python server which handles-Um, so last week I have written that and it seem to be working. So it now written a in C, which can communicate with our server and send sends it translations. I have tested that-And I've also add the example, ORGANIZATION7 worker client, server, sorry, to use that code, but I haven't tested it yet. Probably doesn't work.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I need to figure out what best way to test. I don't know if I need to maybe write dummy ASR worker test sentences or something like that.",
            "Yeah, that's it, that's text only way of running the pipeline. And this is what PERSON14 has asked for. And I don't know if-PERSON14, could you could you explain what exactly we would like to have for this type of testing?",
            "There is text to text client. And it don't use sample client but production client. And there is text client which should be able to send text to text worker. So you can run only from English text to for example German text.",
            "Ok, that would that would be perfect. Testing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also here we work on this week and it works with our Czech machine translation, but there is still some bug on kick side, only the first sentence. PERSON6, PERSON15.",
            "The KT translation platform is very heavily specific use case that we're using it in. It is meant to be run with the continuous input stream. So, it does not handle the batch the batch example very well. It's also possible then some cases it's not confirming to the interface, so like sending the done message to early, which is why you are only getting the first message. It is translating all the other messages. If they were fixed. some checks that relate to partial sentences, for example, if one sentence in your chat testing data does not end in the period or a full stop. Then it will assume that is the first half of a partial sentence, and it will, it will output the sentence with dot at the end. And it will pend the next sentence because it thinks that them those two together make a full sentence. So that's a lot of different checks in there. That relate to the partial sentences. I meant to work together with the segmentation and the ASR worker and our presentation platform. To input-To make the input appear continuously, so, it's-Personall, I'm not sure exactly how will go, but fixings is because will require fixing the ASR, the segmentation and the MT from us, at the same time. It were all done by different people, only one of them is still here.",
            "And it's you.",
            "So, this will be an interesting challenge.",
            "And you're the, you're the person the only one who is left. Or PERSON5?",
            "PERSON5, PERSON5 is the only one who's left.",
            "Okay, so if every sentence on the input and with period, then other sentences?",
            "Though, worker round that you can do that works somewhat is waiting between sending sentences. Yes make sure every sentence and full stop. And wait sentences. So you don't send all the sentences at once but wait. That is a worker round for now, it's not great, but.",
            "Ok.",
            "As if the sentences were spoken.",
            "Actually, this week we work together with PERSON14 and PERSON6, in order to find better workarounds. We also fix something I can-I fixed something in the mediator, in order to better manage second messages and also. Probably we need to perform more test next week. But I hope that we will find out a solution even if, at the moment, the ORGANIZATION5 worker are not meant to manage, the batch use case. Of course, at some point we have to manage it in the worker.",
            "Yeah. So just to doublecheck the overview, the big picture. The batch is needed by PERSON14. Only for the preparation of the data. So only for transcribing, having ASR output in order to train machine translation on this. Correct?",
            "Yes, this is, I need the segmentation for to obtain the train data.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For, for training MT we would need it for analysis of evaluation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "MT systems.",
            "Yes, but actually.",
            "But also feel with it. In order to test the solution.",
            "No, so, actually there are main priority now, is to have the online mode working. So also PERSON5 needs to test machine translation by looking at the output of the online ASR. So I would suggest to focus on fixing the batch processing mode. Instead, I think it may be even better, if like PERSON14 send audio files to PERSON5 and PERSON5 did the ASR offline. But that would be like the way to get the transcriptions. Because we still would not get that true online segmentation since it is going to be changed at ORGANIZATION5. Don't see any big benefit from fixing the batch processing at ORGANIZATION5 through the mediator. Cause this is not going to be in any critical pipeline. Any time soon.",
            "Okey, okey.",
            "Okey.",
            "So, so maybe if PERSON6, does that sound reasonable, so that PERSON14 would send the audio files to PERSON5 or to you, and you would do the ASR offline, and you would check the segmentation. To make just visually sure that the segmentation is somewhat close to what we can expect. When we are running online. What we already know that the online operational mode will be slightly different from what we get offline. And it will also be different from what is being delivered now. These changes.",
            "Yes, I think that's that's reasonable. I think you should send it to PERSON5, because he's the one working with ASR.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As for the segmentation. I'm not sure how close it will be. But I can say that our moduls are also not actually trained on the segmentation. We don't have that either. And it works fine. So I would think that the segmentation is all prepared for offline ASR is reasonably close to what online ASR produces.",
            "Yeah. Ok. So what is needed in order that, so that PERSON5 can check that. I think the best way would be constantly running ASR worker, and PERSON5 sending the audio file and making sure that the finger prints like connect the together. Or is there-Should we use the text only client? For the testing?",
            "I don't understand. For the offline ASR we won't have a worker. It will just be our ASR.",
            "Yes.",
            "Whatever infronts mode that they have.",
            "So forget the offline mode of operation. We do not want any offline mode of operation. We want PERSON5 to be able to test the mission translation. I do not know if PERSON5 is still there, because-Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are not moving. The visual is still. So the-What is your current, you've discuss this 5 minutes ago. And PERSON14 feat to this client, can you just repeat to me the exact set up for the testing of the PROJECT1 worker connection.",
            "Ok.",
            "So what will you run on your command line, that's it. So what the, what will be the, the exact command, what will the command do? To in order to test the all integration.",
            "Yeah, I daily, I would have a plain text file sentences resembling what's going to come from the ASR, and I would just feed adding to a client passes it through little mediator. Which then request of my PROJECT1 worker, to do the translation.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then through the mediator gets the translation back. Yeah. So such a client operate at the level of lines, so every line is a request, right? Yeah. So is this level, is this the one that PERSON14 mentioned? PERSON14.",
            "Yes, it sound, sound, sounds like the same thing.",
            "Yeah. And so it works. And it has, you mentioned some problem of things being stuck somewhere. No, that's there's-It works. Right, is that.",
            "Sorry, that's I think PERSON14 mentioned, mentioned the getting stuck. Yeah, so as I know the PROJECT1 part is working.",
            "Then, PERSON6, what we need is to have lines of text that resemble the output of the ASR. And this is something that we would like to get from the audio recordings that you process, in offline mode, totally outside of the mediator. ASR output that will be getting as messages when it goes through the mediator.",
            "It's definitely possible. I'll closely resemble the mediator with probably just a matter of configurations. So I think we have offline ASR systems that are and what's running in the mediator. But I think we also have very similar offline systems.",
            "And as for segmentation?",
            "You will have to ask PERSON5 about the details for that. And, I think the these ASR systems do their own segmentation, they don't use the same type of segmentation. Because I believe what happens is for the Dutch people so you already have segment. The offline ASR does that in a different process.",
            "Yeah. So there is a big risk that if we train on the segments from the ASR will get something very different from the on, from in the online mode. I see that as big risk, because it would be a different segmentation pipeline. There is even maybe no segmentation happening in word. There is no, no cashing worker and things like that.",
            "As far as I know our MT models for the mediator aren't trained on ASR, on actual ASR output at all. The ASR output does relatively close to resembles like TED talks and your sort of spoken word empty datasets. We have a fine tuning from lectures, but that also the transcription was manually improved just manually created in the first -",
            "Revised. Yeah, ok. So it seems that the machine translation quality is not affected by mismatching segmentation between the training mode and the operation mode.",
            "Yeah, that's it because sorry, PERSON10. I mean, what PERSON6 is saying is they have managed to get, or that actually tried with online ASR.",
            "Well, negatively affected. I mean, what I understood is that ORGANIZATION5 have already connected together online ASR and machine translation system trained independently on the current state of the art. So yes, there could be benefits, from, yeah the integration.",
            "Oh we don't know.",
            "But it's sufficient, we don't know it.",
            "And is it, is it possibly sample of online ASR. You know, if we had a sample of online and offline, ten sentences, or I don't know, some small sample, just to compare. I mean, Yeah. I mean, I appreciate what you're saying that it may look different. But there.",
            "So the easiest.",
            "Everyday, I can send you some samples from the actual translator.",
            "Yeah, but we should check.",
            "Yeah, well, I just say it's quite difficult to get lots of lots of online ASR, is that the problem, we can't really get the partial sentences of it. Is that what you are saying, that it is hard to get It is hard to get 200000 sentences on online ASR in order to find tuning. Is that a problem.",
            "Well -",
            "With transcript moved.",
            "Parallel data, that's it.",
            "Because you have to feed all the audio through, sorry?",
            "We have, we have some our fine tuning we have 15000 minds of lecture that were that were manually translated.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But that's it. So getting parallel data is the real problem. We can get online ASR, we have 19 different lectures that are using online ASR. But.",
            "Ok.",
            "So I think our main concern is not the quality of the translation, but the mismatch of the segmentations.",
            "That's not affect quality.",
            "Yeah. Well, we hope.",
            "Ok, I guess.",
            "So I can say this.",
            "It's terrible demo, try to make it better.",
            "Updating and redoing the segmentation, Is actually probably the next thing on our list of priorities, segmentation worker is the oldest component of that pipeline, so what we are going to try to get improve this quality of segmentation, to make it more.",
            "Yeah, ok. So to somehow mute with this. I would like to ask PERSON14 to send the TED files, which do have their translations. And so they do have the transcript, they also have the translations. To send this to ORGANIZATION5, to PERSON5. PERSON5 is, or you know. So PERSON5 would hopefully process this. PERSON14 would get the offline data. We would see how different is that. And PERSON6, please check that the line oriented output is as similar to the segmentation that we are going to receive from the segmentation And PERSON5 can in the meantime test the PROJECT1 worker. So everything seems good, like for the baseline mode of operation, right? You agree or do you see any problems?",
            "That sounds reasonable to me, yeah, PERSON14 is like it. Can I access to you client code?",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm trying to set up this, yeah. The microphone level I don't know, voice activation level. Here it is. I need to raise it a bit so, that the noise around.",
            "A quick sidewalk, because.",
            "Yes.",
            "The chat is filling up with these messages but no ASR worker being available. I did just received a message from PERSON5, apparently even though he is technically on vacation. He was checking ORGANIZATION6, that he sees nothing wrong with the ASR workers, they are running, and they are, they're available Maybe I, maybe I mispoken about which workers, I will check again. Because, I would like to know whether this is the problem with the client, I would check it.",
            "Yeah. So we don't have anyone from ORGANIZATION2 here. So this is the thing that is actually still on our list for the downloading the document. And that's the debug. That needs to be debugged and kills all the workers very quickly. So I think that we are just seeing again, the same bug. But we do not know what exactly the bug is that PERSON5 will be fixing sooner or later. Okay, so thanks for the details on the PROJECT1 worker, hopefully as we just said. And the production client so PERSON14, can you say what this is. Oh, this is, oh yeah, ok, this is just the batch mode, so actually we do this differently.",
            "Yes. We just start question about it.",
            "Yeah. So please just write it down that we, we have solved this differently by going to simply offline mode and will focus on the batch operation later on. And PROJECT1 workers or text client. Yes, so I think that's still this line that I've just highlighted in the ORGANIZATION4 document, where PERSON14 says, \"I also need either the PROJECT1 worker or text client for CTM to TXT, or better both, to get the final hypothesis. And evaluate my.",
            "Yes, to txt is the second to that machine worker.",
            "Yeah, so is it, is it not available? Or what is the problem. The current segmentation workers are there, aren't they?",
            "Maybe they are there, but it didn't work with my os batchmode. The text to text client.",
            "Oh yeah, the segmentation workers expect data of type unsegmented text and I'm not sure that a client exists, that send that sort of data. I'm not even sure what it looks like, I haven't look in it.",
            "This week I created such client or there was one and I and I start using it. And it didn't work. So I ask you to check it, but since we just agreed that we are going to use your final we don't need it.",
            "Of course next week we can perform again test all together in order to check both segmentation worker and other things together.",
            "The segmentation worker shares a lot of the code with MT worker and therefore will probably have the same problem as the text client for the MT worker. At some point, they will both be redone, but I can't promise that will be next week. I will try to get it as soon as possible. But I don't have a precise time.",
            "But you really use this offline.",
            "But still, I got, I'm sorry, I'm little bit lost. The CTM is the word level output of ASR.",
            "Yes.",
            "But what we are expecting all are MT clients in and the workers, including the PROJECT1 one, expect already the text, so the segmented output, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "In operation, even for the online mode, at the workshop in June, right?",
            "Yes, they working on line mode, but not in batch mode. They don't work, they don't work with CTM, but only in sequence with first ASR and then segmentation. But the ASR workers are not reliable to debug it or.",
            "To debug. Ok.",
            "Is on ASR on.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok. So I understand that in order to test the machine translation, you always have to ship audio and you always have to rely on some ASR worker being available and that's problematic. Because of the bug to ship the CTM output which you will have, you can record from some previous session. But there is no such client. And there is no immediate plan to have such client, that would be able to digest CTM, send it and then use the segmentation worker in isolation, right? Is that correct?",
            "The client is there but the workers are not prepared for him.",
            "What workers?",
            "The segmentation workers in ORGANIZATION5.",
            "They don't work with the CTM client.",
            "Yes. Right now.",
            "Ok. So this is some incompatibility because it like TED evolved different stages. OK. Well. It should, there is no urge to fix this client, for the CTM, but at, but the condition log the testing of the machine translation.",
            "Yes, also.",
            "So if so PERSON5, if you will be struggling with testing on by, testing your MT worker by shipping audio, then please, let us know earlier than next Friday. And let ORGANIZATION5 know, that.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, and hopefully ORGANIZATION5 will find solution. Either fix the CTM or maybe ASR workers more reliable. So which moves us to the next line. And that's ORGANIZATION5 ASR workers the bug.",
            "Yes. I'd like to have sort of a more directed bugging session for that. So a couple notable things that the problem seems to be that, that after session is completed the client has send all of it stuff, recieved all of its output, stop sending anything. But the worker still believes it's part of a session, and therefore does not accept and is registered as such in the mediator. So the notable thing. And it happens mediator, which is the old one in Adam and the ORGANIZATION7 mediator, which is new in a Java. So we need the only common link that they share is the client. That the, the audio client. I don't think I've observed this with text very much. So if I had to guess at where to look for the bug. It would be in that.",
            "Aha, so PERSON15, you're not here for the for second.",
            "Yes, but actually I see that the ASR worker has start producing some text in the chat window.",
            "Yeah. So that probably, yeah. So PERSON5 has probably restart it again. And PERSON6 was describing the bug, while you were not here. And, yeah. And by his summary if I try to re-That the ASR workers are And they are registered as non-ideal even when they have finish their jobs, and send there done messages to the mediator. And this happens with both the old mediator in Java, they happen for as well for the for the ASR worker, right. And the only common thing that PERSON6 sees is actually the worker, sorry, the AS the sound client, the audio client. and the different set ups. And the bug is still triggered. So, this is, PERSON6 said that he would like more hands on debugging session so that you would do this join it.",
            "Yes, sure. PERSON5 we will be back next week and we can arrange some kind of, some test together, of course.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "By the way, I'm looking at the ASR output in chat. PERSON5 you were wondering whether the ASR insert any tags other than words. Even though it doesn't, I guess it does. There are lots of lots of tags in there. They are removed by the segmentation workers, so in the in the MT input, these tags are not present.",
            "So what we are seeing here is the direct CTM output?",
            "I'm really not sure what exactly we're we're seeing, because like I said, the segmentation worker should remove these.",
            "Of course. There is also the ORGANIZATION2 platform mediator which performs maybe some kind of most processing.",
            "But PERSON15, you could know by looking at the mediator, you could know what fingerprint is ORGANIZATION2 receiving. And that fingerprint would tell you, whether they are receiving the segmented output or the CTM already. Can you check?",
            "Yes. I'd say.",
            "Because I think that from the users point of view, even if we are seeing pretty bad voice recognition here, because whatever sound conditions, it would be nice to have this directly translated at this level of individual worse, almost. The delay, yeah.",
            "I'm really not sure what it what it is recieving, because normally the present our presentation platform doesn't handle unsegmented text. It only handles the text as it comes out of the segmentor.",
            "After.",
            "Will using our segmentor, than there shouldn't be any text. If I ask PERSON5 about this. I'm lot confused about.",
            "So you have mentioned a number of things that you do like number of tricks that you do within your segmentation worker, like detecting the end of sentence, adding 3 dots and things like that. And this, all these tricks, can you, are there part of SLT ORGANIZATION5? Of the published scripts or not?",
            "No. So the SLT ORGANIZATION5 is the sort of everything except the actual neural networks part that is doing the work. So SLT ORGANIZATION5 is connected to the mediator, doing some preprocessing for MT, for example, like PPE, and that sort of thing. And then invoking some kind of MT sequences worker it is. Which is why I want to also now frame work. The segmentation worker is sequence as I understand. Is a sequence labeling-Labels each word with either opf insert coma or insert the full stop.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And.",
            "Capitalize, drop, or, yeah. And that's it, there is no-So this is all the logic, all the trees that you mentioned.",
            "I don't I'm not sure.",
            "Okay.",
            "The system is we actually have to.",
            "Because this, yeah.",
            "Reverse engineering, we actually have to look back into it. Make sure that we figured out everything again.",
            "Yeah, because we, it's fairly reasonably described in the SLT ORGANIZATION5. And I think that we could follow that, but when you were mentioning like adding three dots, for unfinished sentences, I didn't see anything like that in the SLT ORGANIZATION5. Then just the SLT ORGANIZATION5 plus the train labourer model. So you think there is not anything more, not any other component in the pipeline. Is just the labeling, the labourer, the trained model and the published scripts in the SLT ORGANIZATION5, right?",
            "Sorry.",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm not able to check it right now, since log has been over written by something else. Sorry. I have to check it better, I have to restart the mediator in order to check it. I take these opportunity in order to tell you to implementing your workers, mediator is not reachable. So that when I restart it, then the worker connects it again. Actually, there are a lot of workers which already has this logic, but just a reminder. Perfect, thank you.",
            "As far as I know our ASR worker connect, reconnect very quickly, the MT workers do as well, but it take some time.",
            "OK. So this is important for PERSON5 as well, and it's also important for us. We will be doing the ASR integrations, which is now like overseen by PERSON14. We're not sure still if PERSON14 will do it or someone else, but. But PERSON14, please take a note, that we need the reconnection. When the, when the mediator dies. Their worker should survive and reconnect again.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, ok. So we were talking about the segmentation worker. And the tricks, and PERSON6 said that there is not anything extra beyond what's in SLT ORGANIZATION5 plus the trained model. So let's, let's hope it's like that is. If there are some other things, than the output of the ASR which will get from you offline, will be different from the output that will get from this improved pipeline that you maybe using. Well, let's all the problems are. So are we in state, where we can do PROJECT1 test next week, PERSON5.",
            "I think so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I need to debug text client. Or PERSON14, I don't know.",
            "Can you-I just realized you don't have access to our github. So is your Github account PERSON5? So I'll.",
            "Yes.",
            "To ORGANIZATION6, so if you need to discuss something online, than it's good.",
            "Yeah, ok. So, we have discussed the bug. So there will be session, session with and PERSON15 next week. ORGANIZATION5 segmentation and MT, how is the fix, with the batch sentence, so this is, this was, has been made irrelevant. Ignore batch mode until PROJECT2, ok. Yeah, so this is for ORGANIZATION2. Let's not discuss this here. Remember that when mediator dies, worker needs to survive. Ok. Anything else we need to discuss, I check that we are covering, covering the languages somehow. And, that's probably it. So.",
            "Is this spoken languages or target languages.",
            "It's target languages. Everybody will be speaking their non-native English. So for the final set up. We'll have four cabins with interpreters, students of interpretation, and will have one floor signal, which will be the original signal, will have 1 or 2 re-speakers, into Czech and from that will have interpretation into German. So the German will have double delay. And we need to decide online, which of these streams in concatenation with the ASR and the MT is the best set up. For you, like the. How will we do this, the online decision. How will be killing the various pipelines and switching the pipeline so that the presentation platform will jump on the different sources.",
            "The presentation platform will receive all those streams. And we can, we will have on the presentation platform an administration page where we can choose the main the selected stream for each languages. From we can, which can cover the main one outage. So that the main stream dies for some reason, we still have, we will still have the subtitles even if are not the preferable ones.",
            "Yes, so it now it seems that it will be all, yeah sorry, your office is just horrible, I could not work there for, it's really too loud. So if we have four different pos MT that translate to this many target languages that you see here in the document. The Romanian, Polish, and then the Dutch, and Spanish. And we decide to switch the source of English, because the re, how do we do this?",
            "Sorry, can you repeat it, the example?",
            "Yeah, yes. So there is all the participants, and there is a Dutch participants and Spanish participants. And everybody is, someone is some Czech person is speaking in English, and his English is horrible. So there is this 2 re-speakers in their, so is pronounciation, simply works better with the ASR. So the ASR output coming from re-speaker one is better than from re-speaker two. And what we need to do now is to make sure that subtitles in Romanian are based on the machine translation all the target languages at once. Or we could do it one by one, but that would be like six times the choice.",
            "Well, this is not perform in the presentation platform, because the presentation platform is just a presentation layer.",
            "Ok.",
            "This should be done, this should be decided in the selection of pipes in the mediator and should be done by the client at the moment. who will want to see ASR outputs and find the component. Actually, it's a new component of the work project and we have to reason about it really carefully.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok. So how do we do a fallback solution without this many middle set up. The fallback solution that I see is that each of these source streams is assumed always pro all the sequence, that you mentioned, and we would be manually killing those that we do not like.",
            "Yes, exactly. The actual solution is to have a kind of combinatory explosion of all the possible match matching path. I know it's not that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But the presentation platform would stay would stay alway on. And it would constantly keep checking for the various sources, right? And it would pick up the highest scoring the highest rank one that is available.",
            "Yes, for example, the presentation platform will recieve for example, the German but I told based on English source or and based on for example or English.",
            "English too.",
            "And at the presentation as subtitle.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So we should have an operator monitoring the output of the re-speakers cabins. And if the output from one of the re-speaking cabin or the output from the floor is bad, this operator should kill the client that is unavailable, the machine translation will not be connected to that and further and the presentation platform will automatically jump to the other provided translation, right?",
            "Yes, actually discussed in the last meeting. To provide that kind of preview of the subtitle in the configuration page. And I don't know if it will be available for June. But actually I sorted the functional requirements. This monitoring activity will be possible also at presentation level.",
            "Yeah, ok, that's very good. But the killing has to happen at the level of the client. And the hardest part that I see is going back when there is speaker two again, becomes a good source. So that means that I need the ASR worker again, and it needs to connect to the MT worker again. And we know that this start up is something which is risky because the workers remain blocked for some time. Yeah.",
            "But actually, killing the client is useful only to in computational power on servers which was the workers. Otherwise we can keep all the clients up and running. And streaming audio. The presentation platform will recieve of course more streams.",
            "But I know, but the reason to kill the client is that I'm not happy with the ASR output that I'm getting from that. Or I'm not happy with the machine translation that I'm getting from that. So I kill the client because I don't have for now any way of worker around. If the presentation platform already, or if there was a man in the middle, I would use the man in the maddle, middle set up, to disable this stream of input. But as I do not have the man in the middle, I need to kill the source. And that's why I'm would kill the client. So, I'm.",
            "I think what PERSON15 is proposing is that all audio inputs are translated into all target languages at all times. And that they matter of which one is shown to the to the audience is just thing in the presentation platform.",
            "Yes.",
            "That you don't, that you wouldn't stop any input.",
            "No.",
            "That is fight with the re-speaker one, then you stop showing the translation that resulted from re-speaker one. But re-speaker one would continue to be translated.",
            "Yeah, so this is my prefer set up, as well. But I understood that there is no way to switch, which of the sources is the one to be presented while the whole system is running. So I would also prefer the presentation platform to have access to all the Spanish, and then choosing which of the Spanish is the best one. But I'm not sure that the presentation allows to choose them on the fly. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "But actually, for June it will not be available the preview of the subtitle. But the selection of the stream should be available. So it could be selected also by.",
            "Ok, so there will be someone monitoring the presentation platform, and we would know, by looking at these the lock files on the side that we are that we could like somehow hack together the monitoring in a separate window. And in the separate window will see that the manually select in the presentation platform stream number 44 is the one to show, because stream number 35 was big has become like of bad polity, right?",
            "Actually, kind of, we can only see the selected one and not all the others. This is the preview functionality that will be for June.",
            "No, no, but how do I select different one? I will not see its output until I select it, but I can al, I can select it, right? I can make a blind, within the presentation platform control, I can make a blind choice. I can keep choosing whichever versions of German or Spanish are there. And the one that I currently select will be presented to everyone. So there is a high risk of me choosing something bad. Like select based on this side information.",
            "Yes.",
            "OK so then the indeed, we, will not have men in the middle, but will have a man watching logs from the ASR workers and logs from the MT systems. And the same man doing the choice in the presentation platform, which is blind that choice, because I missread the IDs. Then I will see immediately that the stream that I've selected is wrong one and I'll choose a different one. Right?",
            "Ok, is the man who's performing the monitoring is able to access to the ASR log and to the machine translation log, yes. Otherwise he can access the only the.",
            "The ID.",
            "The final.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And present it. Exactly.",
            "And present it, yeah. Yeah, can there be more people monitoring the same presentation platform at the same time, so that one would be checking the Spanish outputs, and one would be checking the Dutch outputs, and one re-checking the German ones, and they would like simultaneously make their decisions.",
            "Yes, is the same logic as an user may see the English final subtitle or French one, that's it.",
            "So it's just a multitude of those. Because you are controlling all the different target languages. The final users.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Actually the browser of the cl the final user will be the client of the subtitle solution. So the client will connect to a particular stream of publishing subtitles and this is to both for the one who's configuring the system.",
            "Okay, so it will be the exact same window. And the normal user is selecting which language he wants to see and this super user, the monitor of the presentation platform is choosing for all the followers of Spanish, which Spanish source should they get, right?",
            "Yes, actually I hope that this is not a something that we have to choose so many times during the conference. Usually the configuration should be done at the beginning.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And not multiple times during the event.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Well since we have the multitude of sources it is possible that will do it more often than what is normal. But, yeah, ok. So this is this is sufficient solutiont, solution. So we'll have more people looking at this, looking at the different 2 platform. One of the persons will be responsible for making the Polish output using the best ASR, another would be responsible for making Spanish output using the best ASR, and they all would look at the ASR and they would like indicate to each other, which of the ASR is the best at the moment. And which of the MT outputs is bad. Then dynamic choice even without, even without killing all the clients. And that's important.",
            "Sorry PERSON10, just a technical question, our integration has ask me to report you, they are pretty care by the fact that 4000 people connects on the same WiFi network.",
            "That's, that's for, that's not for the June.",
            "Ok, how many.",
            "For next year.",
            "Current user are expected to be at June.",
            "It depends how do we deliver the subtitles. Is the part of the mediat-This is your decisions, so you need to make these decisions. You need to decide how to deliver it to the people. And you with ORGANIZATION1 together. So, ORGANIZATION1 can order whatever devices they want for the people. I'd saying upfront, we also don't believe that 400 can receive the signal our WiFi reasonably well.",
            "Actually this could be really important point of failure for our solution, we have to be careful about it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm glad that you know about it. But your technicians need to propose what should be done then. Like what way of presentation do we want to offer to the participants.",
            "We are, we are not network engine, we are software developer.",
            "Yeah, yeah, but still, you are the integrator so somehow we need to come up with the solution. So well, we could ask, I'm just making this up. But we could ask ORGANIZATION1 to organize the people by the language and to put like screens in front of group that wants to read Polish subtitles. Which is awkward, but it's a technical solution. So that's one thing. We have a year to find better one. We could also add wires, so to like half the number of clients there. Will be will be a lot again. This is, let's leave this for the next PROJECT3 call. But let's put it as, let's put it there is an important point.",
            "Ok.",
            "Well, I don-We could do other things, we could, there is I know of a company, because PERSON1 mentioned that. Like a friend of hers has various tools to support subtitling and also transcribing of speech, manual transcribing. So they develop their own keyboard for fast transcription and things like that. And they also have. So is like a little bar of letters and you can send the this the text to that. So in that way, we would have a multiple of those and that would that would work. Yeah, so let's leave this for the for the PROJECT3 call.",
            "Yes, please. I hope that also PERSON2 which is a more expert technician will comes up with a brilliant solution, about this part.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Ok, yeah. I think that's everything for today. So thanks a lot. Right. And let's talk again next Friday and in the meantime, hopefully you'll report to me that some of the bugs were resolve. And that all everything works, and that we should ship our PROJECT1 models to PERSON5 and then or we should test the PERSON5 workers with our PROJECT1 model. Yep. Bye.",
            "Thank you.",
            "PERSON5, I'm sending you an e-mail right now.",
            "Perfect, thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Ok, yeah, thank you, bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Do I close this.",
            "Yeah, bye."

            "Hello, can you hear me, is it doing anything?",
            "Yes, PERSON12, now we can hear you.",
            "Ok, yeah, so the microphone here was muted. Sorry. So now, the voice level of the amplification should be reasonable. Okay. Great. So that is one monitoring problem fixed. And, can you see me?",
            "Yes, we can see you, so here's PERSON4, PERSON10 and me.",
            "Yeah, so we are here, and this is PERSON11 and PERSON9. And we have the screen in the back and the screen is still empty. It's only some mountains above that should be ideally, the presentation from PERSON9's notebook. Through, the like which is there to PERSON11's notebook and PERSON11's notebook is also recording all the-all the audio through this. So we have two inputs, and one of them microphone has that batteries but. So but we don't have any true German speaker at the moment. So the worst problem is that PERSON4 will not be available for this call. I don't know how this is possible. He has another meeting, and I also haven't heard from. Haven't heard from PERSON3 this morning, and what we don't have is the presentation platform. So the way we are presenting the subtitles, for now, is only directly when the worker. The sorry, when the client at PERSON11's notebook. What's the status at your notebook? That's all right, I'm the only one who is talking on Pexip now. So, So what we have there, can you share the screen? Screensharing, share my screen, So you should be seeing. This is this is what you should be seeing now, it's PERSON11's screen that runs the client for connecting together, one ASR worker and then the translation into Czech. That's the lower, the larger window in the background. And the machine translation worker is which one? Is it the PERSON11. So PERSON4, you have all the languages running, right?",
            "I did, some of them have just going down i tried to modify, Czech is running.",
            "Yeah, should we try different language, so that you can also see the quality?",
            "I think maybe down,",
            "Yeah, please test German worker and PERSON11 can at the same time start third window, right? With, another client getting the same sound input and sending it now through the through the German empty. So what we have now, on PERSON11's screen, which you can also see, it's shared there. It's two of the commands. One of the command is running only the ASR worker and the other command the lower window is running both, the ASR worker and the machine translation into Czech. And I would like a third one, which would be also doing the machine translation into German. And this is the set up where all the workers are totally like independent. And the same ASR processing is done two times now, and it will be done three times with the German one.",
            "We have only one English segmenter. So we can run only-We have two segmenters. So we can run only two at once.",
            "Yeah, that's that's a problem, and we don't have PERSON4 to add more. So we'll have to give up on one of these outputs right. Yep, so what should we tests now?",
            "German translation.",
            "Yeah, German ASR.",
            "Yeah, German ASR, that's another thing that we could try.",
            "Do we have do we have a empty system German to English?",
            "I'm not sure, that PERSON4 would could have one. And ORGANIZATION3 could have one, German to English.",
            "Sorry, we don't have machine system, but we could try test the ASR if you want.",
            "Yeah, so I think that's we should try that as well. So for the for the workshop actually, it's it's seems that we are short of German interpreters. So the German signal will be available only like for 20 minutes, and then 20 minute break and 20 minutes again, because it will be only one person attending the last 20 minutes, and they have to take break. So that is at least one benefit of our technology that it should, if it runs it runs. But anyway, we should be ready for that, because the German from the ASR will be much better and German speakers will be much happier to see, the human interpretation, but we should be testing everything. So I think we should do it with the other mike, right? So I will try to get the batteries, and you're right that the good thing about German ASR is that we don't rely on the German, on the English segmentation worker so that could run as well. So I'll, I'll get the mike with, the weather is for the second mike. So, well without the headphones, you won't, no one will hear you in the room.",
            "So now saying that our English also running empty would like to test that.",
            "Ok, so I'm going to run it. Ok, so I'll share my screen again. So I launched the German empty, English to German. Now I'm speaking German, now I'm speaking English and I should see German translation. Can you see it?",
            "Yes, that, it says you're now talking about you're talking about bacteria.",
            "Can you say something? Let's try this.",
            "I'm sorry for my lateness.",
            "Ok.Yeah, ok.So we have German empty, yes, we have English into German empty, PERSON12 is back.",
            "Yeah, sorry, we've just noticed this it the ORGANIZATION3 translation service, not the any problem. I think we might want to try ORGANIZATION4 as well.",
            "Ok. Wait, so I add another option, here, ORGANIZATION4, you, the ORGANIZATION4. So this is your empty, right? So, what time I'm talking about right now, tell me, computer. Tell me, tell me, what time I'm talking about.",
            "Not too bad.",
            "Yeah, this is not too bad. We can try something, something.",
            "Yes, it has to be some, some prodution from your polits, yes, Mr. President.",
            "Yeah, PERSON12 is starting another mike, right now. This is all right, it's set up. You should see blinking here, PERSON12.",
            "So I'm I'm yes,",
            "One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four, so this is what I'm saying directly to the head set microphone. You can see me and PERSON11 is also holding the second mike, so that you hear what I'm saying, and you are seeing the translations with the delay one, two three, so yes,",
            "Cool.",
            "But I'm following the German words that I spot. Occasionally they are related, but I cannot acess the sentence quality. That's too hard for me to process.",
            "It looks ok,",
            "The segmentation is getting the end of one sentence in the beginning of the next, and we not read it preparefull that, and I think that's something that we need to talk to ORGANIZATION3 they can fix that and make sure that they're not getting these overlapped to two sentences but that's a tranlastions starts. All that input starts with the new sentence.",
            "That's a lot of repetitions.",
            "That's a lot of repetitions, that you hear that. Do we get the same segment same phrase six times and translate it five six times.",
            "Yes, recieving into the fix, into resending.",
            "Can you PERSON3, guys hear us?",
            "Yes.",
            "So there is a lot of repetitions and.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Are coming in.",
            "We are solving another issue, with presentation right now. We cannot follow your discussion. But it would be nice if you wrote the conclusion from this discussion, from this observation to the doc.",
            "Ok, we will.",
            "Whoever what's a problem, please put it into the Google doc at the end of today's blog, there's the critical observations from the test. So any observation you make, please, add it there. So that we know what to fix. And we also noticed that I don't know how to share it, how to do it. So can you open the Pexip, I'll take the second headset. Yeah. So look at look at my screen, look at the web cam that I'm presenting now. So you're now looking at PERSON9's notebook and the think is this HD button view full motion presentation. And you have to click this view full motion presentation so that the frame rave of Pexip is higher and that you will see what exactly is rolling on the on the clients of the ASR. So do you see the click it PERSON9. The HD, it will become blue, no, post thing, view normal presentation. So do you see that? That icon, it's second from the, right on the list of icons of Pexip.",
            "So I'll try to share it in another way as well as well, but I'm not sure if I'll I'll make it. So I will share my screen, entire screen. Allow. So I'm now sharing my-But then, yeah. So I'm sharing my whole screen but the full motion icon has hidden away has hidden away. So I don't know how to, maybe it's not possible to do with the with the screen sharing. So it's-That's right, yeah, ok. So I'll stop my screen sharing again. No, no, we hit the screenshot. So, the, the list of icons that I was So the issue that we are trying to help you solve now is that when you are following the screen presented by PERSON11, PERSON11 are you still presenting the screen? Yep. So when you are when you are following that screen, you will see only update of whole page, like every one or two seconds and that's different, that's very different from what we are seeing. We are seeing it live, many like lines added one by one. I can show you on my from my webcam. So if you look at the webcam. The webcam is maybe a faster. Do you see, do you see what is actually happening on PERSON11's laptop? It's much faster. When I'm talking.It's adding repeated sentences. And it's like continuously updating the translations into both German and Czech. But in Pexip screensharing, you see an update only every two seconds. And to the HD button is the thing that will let you see it in live like faster, without this delay. Was that clear?",
            "That was clear suited for connection so, the HD one.",
            "Appear.",
            "That's how it's work. We had to click it before now it's broken apparently.",
            "So someone is now highlighting the thing, it's who is sharing that's screen.",
            "We found it there.",
            "Yeah, so maybe taky a screenshot of this for our next call. So that later, we know what is where. And we, we have PERSON3 on the call as well, right PERSON3, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, I'm here, good morning.",
            "Yeah, yeah, morning So I'll try it. It's only me, maybe PERSON9 can hear it. Right? PERSON9, PERSON11 can not hear what we are saying. So that's big-I don't hear PERSON9. Yeah, so we'll add one more lap-So PERSON9 was using muted? But you are still-I cannot hear, PERSON9.",
            "I need to enable both.",
            "Yep. Okay. So you can now hear PERSON9, as well. And we should avoid loud speakers. So it will be better. If do we still have another headset? For PERSON11? Yeah. So PERSON11 will connect with one more laptop. So that PERSON11 can hear us as well. So in the meantime, PERSON3 in the Google document, there is-So maybe I will. I will start sharing my screen. That is probably the best idea. Share entire screen. Allow. So if you are following a If you are seeing my screen this it the preparatory calls Google document. And here, at the end of the session today. There is this critical observations from the test. And I would like to ask everyone, whoever has some observation please add it here. So that we-So that we know about the issue. So the first issue is that.",
            "Ok.",
            "Yep. So the first issue that we spotted was that we need life monitoring of everything. If anything is bad we need to trace one step back and see if it was good and this step back or not. Another. Thing is that multiplexing is probably necessary. So the idea is that right now on the cable, a connection PERSON11's notebook is sending three English, three audios? PERSON11, are you sending three audios? Only two. No, he's sending two audios. But we need to send one audio for each output language. Actually.",
            "Haven't you tested the multipol input stream request?",
            "Wait, mike, can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, what did you ask?",
            "Have you tested the multiple imput request functionality. I know you extended the client. But probably you have the multiple input request functionality sent you an email, I don't remember.",
            "Yes.",
            "If this week or the last one.",
            "Okay. Yes, I didn't try it this week. But before the trade fair, we used this functionality. We had one empty One ASR and one recorder and this worked. So I believe that it's still working.",
            "It could It could work also asking, for example, for multiple translations that's giving the input audio file, and they want, for example the germ-German audio file and that want in to receive the English translation and the French translation. The chain work.",
            "Ok. So I will try it. Will be really nice to have it.",
            "OK. The so that's the multiplexing. Then, this is this is observation by ORGANIZATION4. So maybe they could summarize what they have recorded, of what have they noticed to PERSON3. And me as well, because I haven't heard it.",
            "One thing is efficiency thing, like we are getting the same request multiple times, sometimes four five times the same input. Right now it's fine, but it's a bit waste the speciality, to have couple minute languages.",
            "So there should be minimum cashing like, never send.",
            "And if it doesn't change just don't resend it.",
            "Okay, I have, probably some update, because I talked about this behavior, yesterday, with PERSON5 and PERSON4. And actually in the year all used case the one who use the air lange mediator. And not the ORGANIZATION6 one they manage these behavioral directly in the displace server. And all their workers are meant to work in a transparent behavior. They translate multiple times. The same ASR output. And then they feature out segments in their own application. This, of course, is it's not optimal and managing such logic in the presentation layer and it's my opinion at least. It's not correct and it bounce also the usages to the key worker. So I'm trying to figure out something to manage it for the June fair-The June meeting. And they told me that probably the machine translation of ORGANIZATION1 has some kind of improvement, and it was the one I was trying to check this morning. PERSON11 do you confirm that you manage something in your workers?",
            "I started some workers. But yesterday, I tried only the debugging workers. Only the dummy back end SMT.",
            "And I'm trying to investigate this behavior. And what comes out was that the off set is the off set value is probably the one who will contain the key of this solution. Because, as far as I understood. But I have still to check it. They updated the offset only when I finally pote disease arrives. And Or something like this. PERSON4 shared with me a Python script last night, who manage the ASR output, filtering out only final hypothesis. And actually. It works on beginning and not on offset and so also get confused, but we are reason about this topic and we'll update you, of course, or if you discover something, please update me. And at the end we will probably find the solution. We are reasoning about it.I perfectly understand that it's it's not eh-It is not comfortable to translate multiple times the same ASR out.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so I'm. I'm not sure if I totally understood. If you were referring only to this problem of the repetitive input to machine translation, if not if you were talking also about another issue. Please make a separate bullet points here.",
            "No, no, it should be the same issue, but I also, I'm a little bit confused the on this topic, than probably I haven't explain it very well.",
            "So, I think it was ORGANIZATION4 people who said that the empty worker cannot distinguish between January repetition. And wierd ASR behavior, I agree. So this is this is like a presentation issue. We do want to display the same thing twice, if it was set twice. But I think that even if there is a genuine repetition. Your empty worker could save the, the graphics card, or whatever the CP use, time and could cash it. So I think the cashing is useful even if even if there is genuine repetition.",
            "Ok, so you still wants us to return something even if it can say we could repeat it. That's what you are saying.",
            "Yeah, I think the empty worker should be totally like ignoring any context. It should be like a-.It should not be trying to be clever. If it's recieve something twice.",
            "Yes.",
            "It should send it twice.",
            "We can do that it's just-It still seem, like the pushing the problem downstream.",
            "I think it's what we want, because like it's very same string then the empty worker should not have been called. So this is this is the bug. But if it is a minor extension of the sentence then we do want the empty worker to see the whole sentence again, so.",
            "So it is the same or is it the same.",
            "Yeah, so, the same string repeated, how could that happen? We do not have anyone from ORGANIZATION3 on the call. But it is possible that they received they recieved some more audio. And the final hypothesis they create from this, is the identical string. That would be my guess.",
            "So. In that case, they should simply avoid sending an update if it is not different from the previous update.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah. So the alti ee match best solution is that the ASR worker double checks it's output and never sends the same string ehm-If-Well I should very different list still. They will take this outputs, so-Even if a longer sound segment-If longer sound segment happens to lead to the same text hypothesis, this update should not be send to the subsequent empty worker, because it is not real update. So that's the that's the thing. So the cashing it actually an output cash or-Well, that was the right wording. So it's avoid useless, yeah. So I'll delete this.",
            "Very quick question, you're not recieving any more translation, did you guys turn this of?",
            "Did you turn this of or is it are the workers still running. So I'm I'm wearing the two mikes.",
            "No, the workers are not running, and I can't get audio into my laptop right now.",
            "And why has this failed?",
            "I don't know I worry it's only.",
            "Sorry, guys I run a test with the English ASR, maybe it's me, I wrack now finish. Sorry.",
            "I was not following you, so.",
            "I run a test with the English ASR, maybe it was me.",
            "So you think that you were stealing one of the workers, right?",
            "Yeah, I finished, it's all available now.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I'm now talking to the microphone. And PERSON11's notebook not recording anything yet, but the beringer we have, the sound in the sound card, but we do not have the sound in the system, and it's stopped by itself, or have you been changing any of the sound settings? That's look good. Ok, I'll be saying. One, two, three, four all the time. So sorry for the, the useless sound on the Pexip. In the mean-We could we could have some discussion so that I would be stoking only once a while on something useful. So PERSON3, what is the status of the presentation platform. Is there anything we can test today, remember I should be the one talking more.",
            "Yes.",
            "So what can we do? What can we do to test it? Is there webpage?",
            "Okay, I'm-Yes, there is. Unfortunately, I prepared the which uses the German ASR. The German segmenter.",
            "Yes.",
            "The English machine translation, and then publish an English subtitle. But unfortunately right now the German ASR it's not working. So I can ex asure you I really.",
            "The German are.",
            "-less.",
            "The German ASR was working while ago, and PERSON11 has one of the workers for himself. So we are following two channels, I'm talking to the English channel. And we also have the second mike, and that is intended for that's intended for German speakers here like. So I can keep saying something also in German. So one of the German worker is used by us. Where is the presentation platform web? Can you paste it to the Google documents so that we can look at it? So where PERSON3? Have you heard?",
            "Yes, sorry, ok.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can surely and going to write it in the Google doc.",
            "Yeah, so maybe in the status of the components.",
            "Ok, right here?",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Oh my gosh, voice not working. Dunno why does not let me write anything in Google Doc, except to where I do not want to write.",
            "Sorry. Please, okay, okay, platform URL. Okay. I can't share these right now, because it's up and running. But maybe it is better if I share my screen with you so.",
            "Yes.",
            "-you can see my demo. And I'll share with presentation. How can I share the text?",
            "The screen? There is an icon. Can you see it now? So you see me sharing screen. And there is this buttons. A my mouse is moving left to right over them.",
            "No. I do not have this button unfortunately.",
            "You do not have any you don't have this button for presenting?",
            "No, sorry.",
            "OK. Then you cannot share it. So I will share the platform instead of you. So you can see that in my screen sharing, right.",
            "OK. Thank you all for the support. A Lot - Of course, it's a prototype we are working on functionality.",
            "Yeah, this is perfect.",
            "-and not the looking field.",
            "Perfect, no, if this works in two weeks from now it would be perfect.",
            "Ok, On the left you have four buttons for configuring the languages. In this moment we have English, French, Italian and German. You can click on them, enabling subtitles.",
            "Yeah.So you can choose more, ok? Yep.",
            "Also more than two, or mo or less or non-subtitle.",
            "Perfect.",
            "The big black box is the one who displace the -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Like Bugs Bunny.",
            "There is the - this is a demo of course but when we have the M3U8 URL, we can configure the presentation platform to connect to this streaming and display the provide thing.",
            "Yes, so can we test this now as well?",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is something for PERSON9, so if you can extract PERSON9 to use the VLC in some way. Then possibly there like there could be firewall-ish user another things. But we should be able to ship the screen, right? Yeah. This is another thing that should test today.",
            "Ok, okay. If we have-M3U8 URL we can put it in the presentation platform. Actually, the web page is a simple client and it only display what it recieves. So there is There is no business logic inside it.",
            "Yeah, can we the source code of this web page, like if we want to run this web page ourselves for debugging purposes. Can we get access to that, or maybe if you do not want to share the whole thing, then just the video client, so that we can test the video client.",
            "Well, I haven't worked on the source code so I'm not able to share it with you.",
            "So you don't have it.",
            "No.Is somewhere in the our report, but I can ask for.",
            "Yeah. So please use the repository of PROJECT1 to upload at least that part that runs the. At least the webpage that shows the video and this is the thing that we need to link with the screencast that we are going to send. And then we can test whether it's easier for us to send it through Linux machine or through the VLC in Linux, we'll decide. But this is an important thing.",
            "Okay. It's important this weekend that's that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, I perfectly understand. And actually we're still working on the integration for example, we have some problems with characters and coding, right now. But the English subtitle which of course the English language doesn't have. Strange characters is also perfectly representing letting one. Works well.",
            "Yeah. This will be important. So we definitely. For the Czech, we definitely need more we need also letting 2 or UTF8. Ideally, we have. Yeah. So we need isolating one and two at the same time. So please move to UTF8.",
            "No, no. Yes, of course. There's something which is not working in the probably in the examale sent. Through the mediator, we are debating this problem exactly this morning.",
            "Yeah. Ok.",
            "When I will find working ASR worker, for example, if you free me the -",
            "Is there any way that we could ship the data to it? So.",
            "Yes.",
            "PERSON11 has the workers running and if you are following PERSON11's screen as well, I don't know if PERSON11's screen is there.",
            "No.",
            "So-So if PERSON11's start sharing, and if you click the HD button which you may have or may not have. I don't have the HD button, PERSON11 has it. This is. How do I?",
            "Am I sharing right now?",
            "You are not sharing, I don't know how can I. Maybe I need to stop sharing. So I'll stop presenting for now. I can see PERSON3 now. And maybe PERSON11 can now start to meeting participants in control. So PERSON11 is not sharing. Well anyway.",
            "But I'm trying.",
            "Yeah, so what we would like to have is PERSON11 notebook initiating the session. So sending the audio and your presentation platform showing the subtitles corresponding to that. So this is what we would like to set up a. Can you can you let us know how to do it?",
            "Yes. At the moment, there are, let me check it on the admin web. There are for example, for sure, the German, Italian, ok, and the English one. I suggest the English the English output since it's it's much more reliable. But, we could use for example. I'm going to write it in the slack channel.",
            "Yeah. Ok.",
            "Mark testing, ok. Ok, this is my there is a worker who manage the publication.",
            "So If the idea is that to simply send to start the client so that the target well signature is this, an EU pub, right?",
            "Yes, exactly.Actually, the worker is completely transparent, the packets he receives send back exactly as he has received them, but as a kind of processing it publish subtitle on the.",
            "Ok, So we can also see the output in the EB client eventually.",
            "Yes.",
            "So the locks will not change and, yeah. So PERSON11 is now-The same work for German right? DEEU pub, does that work as well?",
            "Sorry?",
            "So can we also present to-unable-I'll show you the, on the.",
            "I'm sharing the screen so.",
            "You can look at PERSON11's screen in Pexip.",
            "Yes, The out input fingerprint is wrong, it's DD.",
            "Yeah, German, DD.",
            "Yes, yes, I can see this one.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, so from now on if this connects, I should be able to see so what is it doing. Disconnect. Yeah, I should be able to see in subtitles what I am saying. Well, we see something in the locks but we don't see it in the Elite in the presentation platform yet.",
            "I suggest to try the English one.",
            "Well, both, it's I think PERSON11 have you.",
            "Yes, I.",
            "Connected both.",
            "I connected English and German. As you can see. Here.",
            "Yeah, so on PERSON11's screenshare, only for the English, ok. So PERSON11 now stopped the German target. And only produces the English output. No, stop the German. Yes, so I can see my what I'm saying in on PERSON11's lock, on PERSON11's screen. But I don't see it in the presentation platform.",
            "It's strange, why it's not working. May I try to perform my test?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "What's the difference. Where is the.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So I'm going to kill it. So you have free resources right now.",
            "The worker is correctly engaged and he says that it's publishing at Winx but I'm me. Too, I didn't see anything in the presentation platform. And I'm running my test. And it's not working. Why? I think it's a matter of web browser I'm using. Ok. Just the second, sorry.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can. I'm able to see it in my Chrome browser but not my Edge one.",
            "Ok, so I'm using Firefox.",
            "Yeah, maybe, ok, let's try. I'm also on two different computers I don't understand if something also related to. It's seems that in the in my Windows laptop it isn't displayed anything even if I run it. Even if I run it in Chrome, but on my Linux desktop it work's well.",
            "And is it Google Chrome or Chromium?",
            "Chrome.",
            "Chrome, ok.",
            "Ok, ok, of course for demo we have to manage it, of course. For demo reason I can try to share my.",
            "The original work? The screen sharing?",
            "Linux, ok.",
            "I'm start thinking that it's a matter of Windows Firewall. I'm using, you are using a Linux laptop?",
            "Yes, but I don't have google Chrome, so PERSON9 has. Well, but there is no subtitles. So I can share with through the webcam. So this is PERSON9's Windows laptop with Chrome looking at URL.",
            "I'm not also not able to see anything in my.",
            "In Windows.",
            "-in my laptop, yep. Oh my gosh. Well, ok, at some point.",
            "We have one Linux machine with. Does anyone have a Linux machine with Google Chrome? To test it now?",
            "Ok, don't worry, at some point it will work, I'm going to.",
            "Ok.",
            "Talk about it with of course the team.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, ok, it, actually it work we haven't yet tested the multiple publication. But should be pretty transparent. And we have still some problem with of course browsers and Windows. But also with characters in coding and we are debugging where the problems is originated, there are strange characters coming out from the ASR or if it's the Java integration whose not correctly managing the. So there's still a lot of work.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But anyway, you have something, this is good.",
            "Sorry guys, we have to leave now.",
            "Yeah. Ok, so what is your main conlusion recall before you leaving from this test. What should we focus on.",
            "In the document is that I said I'm not quite understand the logic in the ASR, because it's giving us sentences in fragments. So if it could talk to maybe they can change the way that this is present I think it will be helpful for us. But on a positive side, in term of efficiency it seem to be able to handle that stream that's coming in without empty worker.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm also quite happy with this speed that the subtitles appeared on PERSON11's screen. So that was good. I'm curious if this will scale up to the six or more target languages and the multiple-input. So this is something that we should probably plan to test next week. To like test it with a whole all load with full number of inputs and full number of outputs.",
            "Yes, from yesterday I start working on the complete pipe. Then something from audio and also segmentation, translation and publication. And everything works fine. I'm, I will be on vacation next week a couple of days so I suggest to perform some massive test on Monday, so that I can provide you my support and we can check everything together.",
            "So which Monday are talking about? The very next.",
            "Next Monday.",
            "So on in 4 days from now, right?",
            "Yep.",
            "So, yes, so during the day I'm available from like eleven to three. Is that a good time frame?",
            "Yeah. Yes for me it's fine.",
            "Which day?",
            "Monday. This very Monday. And I heard PERSON4 that PERSON4 is not available on Friday, right?",
            "Yes, that's right. I can I can make sure the worker is running, but probably won't be available to. I'm not be able to go in meeting. Probably.",
            "Yeah. Ok, so let's plan to have the same type of test call on Fri on Friday anyway. And PERSON3 you are available on Friday or not?",
            "Yes, I'm I should be back.",
            "Yeah, so let's plan Friday same time again. So we are actually starting and nine with the preparations. And then at ten we expect everyone who is available to join. And PERSON4 will not be here. But hopefully all the workers will be running. And we'll. So PERSON2, will you be available next week?",
            "No, I'll be away next week.",
            "And PERSON10? Is so anyone from ORGANIZATION4 could be monitoring.",
            "Next Friday should be available and I should be available to join Pexip, anyway.",
            "Yes. So it back. It's will be Pexip because we want to relieve the workers. From the ORGANIZATION2 load. For the session. So what we will mostly need it to check the work load. If we try to run all the target languages. So we should come up with the set up that runs the ASR and connects all the machine translation into all the target languages. And the presentation platform should present all of these, ultimately. And we need to see if it where it where there are any workload issues. So it could happen everywhere. It could happen at the very first laptop, that does the sound recording. It could happen in the mediator, which I don't expect. It could happen at the ORGANIZATION4 side with the machine translation systems. Yeah, so it could happen anywhere. Ok, so I think that the ORGANIZATION4 people can leave now, thank you very much for your time today and thanks PERSON4 especially for putting this worker together. I would just like to ask if you could get in touch directly with PERSON5 and make sure that they help you with the with segmentation input. I'm a little bit worried that there will be no time for improving this because it will be like creating new models and improving the underlink set up. It's not to me, it's probably not an issue of some rule based coding, but if it is, then it will be great to know this. I think it would be rather some models needed. For this improvement. So I'm afraid that we'll have to live with the current segmentation quality for the for the workshop. But please try, please get in touch with -",
            "Yeah. Ok, so thank you and maybe if PERSON3. PERSON3.",
            "Thank you, bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "And PERSON3, you're still available for some time?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, that's good. So I think, we should try. What can we try? We don't have access to the, maybe you can, yes, if you know, you can tell us how to use the streaming from VLC that work for you. If you, if it work for you.",
            "We haven't found yet a solution.",
            "Ok.",
            "-of the tool prepare exactly an M3U8 starting from VLC.",
            "Yeah, ok, but is there. Can you at least well, I don't recognize if you are else. So can you also paste to the document you are L of any stream on the web. Which has the same format as you are expecting? And we should try to mimic this.",
            "I can provide you the exactly the one including in the.",
            "So that we know what we need to mimic. And what actually happened with the ban, it's still confusing to me. Because if I click play on the bunny stream.",
            "It's not over, it does not start at some time, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so this is not a live. It's like streaming for me, but not for everybody. It's not like broadcasting. I would like to avoid the time scale, well. The play should be only play and pause, but no way of jumping in time. So how does this work with real time streaming?",
            "Ok, in this case we have a playlist M3U8 actually already has all the available chunks bit of chunks. And this is the reason why you are able to skip in time. URL connected to real-time streaming is provide. Of course you will not have future video chance, you have just the right now chunk. And so you will not be allowed to skipping time.",
            "All right, the M3U8 format it's it's list all the currently available chunks and the browser goes, again and again, fetching the M3U8 file, right? And then it sees which part of the time is currently available and downloads those chunks and plays them.",
            "You should work exactly in this way. I'm not guru of streaming video streaming button, as far as I know, it works exactly this way. I brought the Google doc, the bunny M3U8 URL, you can use to test it. There is also setting, a configuration languages displayed under the PROJECT1 logo, right?",
            "Exactly.",
            "And this is done on your side within like when starting this, right? Or is it on, no?",
            "It could be manage real time, when up is already running.",
            "Ok, so there is no way. So it's clicking somewhere hidden and or how do I do it?",
            "Of course you have to be registered, let's say to the system as administrator. In this case you see the main page, possible by each one has the browser.",
            "Well, I didn't follow, like I could follow it was difficult for me to understand. But.",
            "Sorry, PERSON12. The configuration page where you are able to set the and the stream provided for each language. Is not available to each user.",
            "Ok.",
            "But.",
            "Ok. So in the meantime, PERSON4 said that he was, he made himself available on Slack. And I asked him to join the call. So maybe he'll join the call if we're lucky. So if you have any questions on PERSON4, then he should appear here. But I'm not sure if this is already happening. No, I don't see him yet. But that was half an hour ago when he was available on Slack. And he's still like in green, but. No, so? No. So, and Google, Firefox anywhere and Google Chrome on Windows. I think we should we should try to wrap up, so I would like to ask everybody who is still on the call, to go through the current state of the Google document, and add whatever we have not recorded in the. And make the transcript or summary of the messages clear. So try to clean this document now. Because I'm afraid that we have seen many things, but we have not taken appropriate record of all of them. To clean this, clean this up now. Until PERSON4 appears, if he does. Google Chrome on Linux, ok. So PERSON3 you mentioned three issues with this with the presentation platform.",
            "Yes, it's correct.",
            "So what was. It was character in coding, subtitles not appearing. And what else? What was the third one?",
            "We have to manage also character font size, and number of words displayed, of course. Because, well, the application it's dummy, it's simply displays what he recieves. But I'm managing it's in the integration worker, which is the one who has the minus pub fingerprint. I believe we are working still on those things. We have not yet tested the multiple output, but should be pretty transparent. And I'm. We haven't yet tested also the multiple sources for the same language. You know, for exampl.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "The for example English subtitle with source Italian audio or German audio and so. This.",
            "This is this is something which is - Yeah, but it's also like a design decision and I'm not sure how what is the current handling of this. It. Do we think it should be the final end users who would be like choosing which English they want to see, or should it be us selecting the best English for them?",
            "We will be, there will be the administrators, then let's say who will use the.",
            "Yeah, so, can we see the administration interface. Is that the same with the credentials where the configuration happens?",
            "Unfortunately, I'm not able. Oh maybe it work, yes. The TU provider in e-mail in order to access the.",
            "No.",
            "Ok, then it's not possible. Because you have to register to the system, which actually means put. I'm able to display it on my desktop, but I'm not able to.",
            "You cannot share it.",
            "In Pexip, but it's. I can, maybe I can provide you a snapshot. Could be a solution, let me.",
            "So, so is there a URL so that I would just type slash admin or something like that to force it to go to the admin screen?",
            "Exactly, the slash settings and.",
            "So slash. Yeah, so the slash admin does not exist but what. It would be great if this administrator web page would be simply like requested in the URL. So what I'm.",
            "Yes, it is. I paste you the URL in the Slack livestream, but actually it requires the credential.",
            "You cannot add my admin now.",
            "Right now no, sorry.",
            "So can you is your password too secret or...",
            "No, I'm going to. Well, act ok, try to put just my e-mail, it asks just e-mail.",
            "So I'll share, I'll start, sorry, I'll start sharing my screen so that you can verify if I'm doing it right. S end our screen, allow, so are you seeing my screen? Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON3 -",
            "Dot PERSON3, perfect.",
            "Yeah, PERSON3 at Gmail dot com. Right?",
            "No, ORGANIZATION6.",
            "ORGANIZATION6 dot com.",
            "Dot it.",
            "Dot it, ok. ORGANIZATION6 dot it. Log in. And worked.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, excellent. So what is this? There is this video, ok? So this can be changed. Yeah. I don't want to change the Bugs Bunny for now.",
            "There will be the default available languages which are displayed in the front page.",
            "So, we can already put here all the target languages that we are, that we are aiming at, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So it will be also Czech, can someone dictate to me from the Google Doc. It's in the Google Doc if it's clow down. Czech, Polish, Hungarian, what else? I'll save it for now and default available. So what is this available language sources? PERSON3.",
            "Ok, if at the moment the definition of sources is static, it's not dynamic, it's pretty difficult to define exactly the logic of joining services and living services we're still reasoning about it. But actually this will effect the next part of the configuration which is the one related to the language configuration. The sources are the audio sources.",
            "So, actually one think that I thought of during the call and have not taken any note on that. Is that we definitely need big grand map of all the fingerprints you are use through all the process. So we need to know what PERSON11 should ask for we need to know what the worker should be should register themself as, and then what should be displayed. So it's it's now like poppin pokin popping up one by one, we've learn that if we add dash pub it will be grabbed by the worker for the presentation platform. Do we have this grand map of fingerprints anywhere?",
            "We have the we have admin web so we can we can see which workers are running and which fingerprints are they using.",
            "Yeah, but.",
            "But we should have the map anyway.",
            "We need the map because it's different institutions who are starting the different workers and if they misregistered the worker if they use like mismatching fingerprint there is no way to make use of that worker.",
            "Yes.",
            "So PERSON3, you have sure experience with the Slack maps. Should it be a picture or what it's what is the best layout for this?",
            "In order to have the list of all workers the list of input and output it's pretty, pretty much what we need, more important it.",
            "No, no, it's like once we have the idea of what is being connected to what then we know what the inputs and outputs are and it's easy to use it. But the map is needed for the overall connection, what is connected to what. And this is what we are missing.",
            "And you run the for example the EB client, I know it's pretty much an old tool, but when you run it one of the first thing it displays is exactly the path selected. We have completed the in order to aset only exact path and through this.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Feature we can have a full control over selecting path.",
            "Yes, that's good. But what I'm saying is that if we don't have the map, and if someone from runs a worker with some incompatible fingerprint so that the worker from ORGANIZATION4 does not connect to it, then the path would not be accesible. There would be like gaps in the path. And we need.",
            "Fingerprints before the 27 of June meeting.",
            "Yeah, so the point is that if there is a worker connected to the mediator, there is no way for us to change it's fingerprints. It registers with some particular fingerprints and these need to be compatible to this surrounding workers.",
            "Actually that for the one who runs the client is not available this information, and simply provides if so there is no logic implemented in order to change fingerprints to worker, because worker who be there or not or will not be available or it's all delegated to who provides the service.",
            "But, but at least I created bridge worker, I updated the backend SMT worker so we can specify the fingerprints arguments and disconcert us bridge between workers. It's only copy place to source to target.",
            "Yeah, so that's the worst case for back solution.",
            "Yes, of course.",
            "But we should because it's it's sends the data to one more computer and back. So with the with the map, does Google, let's let's actually try with the drawing. So can I add. No this is add an image. Let's try, I'll try creating a new Google drawing document. Google drawings, that's it. And I'll try sharing with you all. So fingerprints map, share, anyone with the link and edit. So I'm now putting link to this map to the Google doc. Try opening this as well. I'll I'll put it in two places. All this we haven't discuss this. PERSON3, are you making it to LOCATION1?",
            "Sorry.",
            "Are you going to LOCATION1 for the workshop? Did you talk to PERSON1, was he succesfully impersuading you?",
            "No, sorry, I really not be there, but actually it's really important for me to be here in order to check and provide you technicals.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok. So, can anyone access the fingerprints map drawing now? So that we see. Platform worker digest these fingerprints ENEU pub. So do you see this? Can you see the, yep. Ok, yeah. So there is some, so PERSON3 have you also access that document.",
            "I can see your screen shared.",
            "No, it would be better if you could access directly the document. And I heard someone.",
            "Ok, I will try.",
            "So PERSON4 can see my screensharing but PERSON4 in the call, but he disconnected again, it's confusing. He was not able to hear us. So please the way this drawing works is that you while you are editing an object, no one else sees it yet. So please create separate objects and do not edit, yeah. And do not edit the existing ones, so PERSON3 could you please put all the fingerprints of the languages that the presentation platform responds you next to he object that I just created? Like underneath.",
            "Ok, let me open it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It seems you have even to, even have to select different tool for it to appear for us.",
            "Ok.",
            "Just hitting enter it not seem to work. But now I see a blank text field from the anonymous alligator and that's filling right in. So I don't know what's going on.",
            "Ok, I add in a different object the at the moment available fingerprints but please consider that it's an instance running on my local pc. Idea is to add just a minus pub to language.",
            "But the German is different, and Italian is different, so the English is, English has EUN it's not like GB, so that's. And we need the full list of languages. So what I'm going to do now is that I'll paste the set of languages that we need to cover. Yep.",
            "I can, yeah you found it.",
            "I found it. So how do I. So I'll actually paste. Oh, so someone was faster.",
            "I did it. You can use it now.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON3 I'll paste it to your, oh this is too bad. And I cannot. This doesn't really work. It's just too stupid. It's simply too stupid. I pasted into the PERSON3's, yeah. So we need CSCZ pub, so PERSON3 is there any update on the presentation platform necessary to accept more fingerprints?",
            "Yes you can reload the home page, you introduce new languages for example the Czech, the Hungarian, the Polish, PERSON6. And if you see in the home page there are more languages available now.",
            "So the home page is this one, and I reload it, yes. So this is those that I introduced. And as so simply by adding these languages to this list, the worker, it's registering these new workers, right?",
            "It's not acting to the worker, it's acting only on the webpage, and it saying the language available for the, for the user. It's not.",
            "Yeah but. But backend also needs to know about them. So what is necessary in order to have the languages as fingerprints the client can connect to and does give them the text.",
            "Client it's not connecting to the workers, it's just.",
            "It is, it is, when PERSON11, when PERSON11 launches the client, I'll say the way I understand it, but you need to correct me if I'm wrong. So I think that PERSON11 launches EB client and tells EB client, here is some audio with this fingerprint it German audio, and I want the target fingerprint find me a path for that and my desired target fingerprint is Italian, Italian pub text. And the EB client connects to the mediator and the mediator find the path and the path will include the worker which digest Italian text and produces Italian pub. And that's the worker.",
            "Yes, PERSON12, we have to agree on whos playing the client role. I was talking about the this case.",
            "Ok.",
            "The publication the user browser is the client.",
            "And in this situation the client browser it's it's not connecting to the workers, it just recieves, recieves.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yea, sorry.",
            "So my question, my original question was when changing here in, I'm still sharing the screen. So when I'm changing the set of languages and I'll add also the Spanish here, ES, this will affect obviously the buttons available on the front page. But there is no way that any Spanish can appear here until PERSON11 will run a pipeline which will end with Spanish pub. And for this pipeline to be access if all the path to be accessible there has to be the worker registered already with it mediator that emits the Spanish Spain pub fingerprint that I'll put this fingerprint.",
            "Yes, yes exactly. The.",
            "So what is necessary, yeah. What is necessary to do this, to have this worker available in the mediator?",
            "In order to have the publication for example for the Spanish language we have just to add it in our worker configuration. Of course the presentation worker, let's say would be run by ORGANIZATION6. We have just to configure all the require the worker and let them run it.",
            "Yeah, so please do it with the set of languages that we need for the. So it's now fingerprint. So I. Well I'm making these up, so I'm not sure If I'm. If is this standard. So for English we are using the EU, for Dutch it's spoken in Belgium and the Netherlands should we also use the ORGANIZATION5?",
            "Well, it's just a matter of for me.",
            "So you don't care. And you have no.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so and let's also do the French ORGANIZATION5 pub right? Because we have, we don't have any French? We're not sure.",
            "We have the names of the participants. They're, we can't exactly ask them about their. So the only way you can do is use the same.",
            "So could you do it?",
            "Nah, I won't. I don't want to have anything with social media. Sorry.",
            "No, just Google for their names. Or the names if they sound french, then we have to.",
            "Well, to my collegue they sound non french.",
            "Non french.",
            "Because I don't know how to translate.",
            "Yeah, vlamish.",
            "Sorry, sorry PERSON12. The developmenting is asking me if you're running Windows ten.",
            "No, I'm running Linux.",
            "You're running Linux, ok.",
            "PERSON9 I cannot hear you now from the Pexip. I'm and tell us about your Windows version.",
            "This thing is Windows 10 and this is Windows 7, but does not have a microphone with, so it's not running.",
            "Yeah, but for the, and you have tried and you have Google Chrome on which of those?",
            "I think on both.",
            "And there is still not hearing anymore?",
            "No I don't have it here.",
            "Does it work on Chromium?",
            "You guys of course the browser, maybe it's related to Windows firewall but you are running Linux, we have to check it, ok. Actually it work also on my mobile device, so maybe you can try with your Android device to connect to the presentation platform by using browser. It should be already optimize for also mobile usage. But this problem with Windows has confused me, because al me you, me too I usually work on Linux and it works pretty well in my situation, maybe it's something related also to as your firewall we have to check it.",
            "Because I have, on the Windows 7, I'm to NLT connection and that should not be too many firewalls in the way. And then also not seeing it. By the way, for the optimization I was wondering if I have bigger screen, now the slides are quite small. But there be option to make it bigger? Because as of now this is hardly awesome.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm, I'm sharing the screen, I'll share my camera instead. I'll stop sharing my screen, how do I, stop that.",
            "It's small.",
            "Thank you.",
            "I'll stop sharing my screen but PERSON9 show this. So this is what the participants are eventually are going to see. They will sit in front of a notebook, each one of them and they will see the subtitles and the slides. And the slides are reduced way too much. So the full screen is not sufficiant default screen, that's the question. Essentially.",
            "Yeah, and there's a lot of blank blue space.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which definitely could be reduce when there is only one line of subtitles.",
            "So PERSON9 could hit as eleven or twelve.",
            "Sorry could you.",
            "And now it's even worse.",
            "Yeah, so this is this is the full screen mode of the web browser, what you're seeing in the webcam from my Pexip, right? And that's the view of what the participants at the workshop would see. And we would like to make use better use of the space of the screen. So we would like the stream video to take configurable or at least much larger space of the screen.",
            "Ok, we can reason about it. I think it's optimize in relation to the mobile usage, because mobile will probably require more space for subtitles.",
            "For the subtitles. Yeah, so can you, this is some CSS fighting. So, so can you make sure it's for the workshop in two weeks now, it's more important to have it optimized for the desktop rather than for the mobile phone.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "But.",
            "I write it immediately.",
            "Yeah. I'll try actually PROJECT1 dot ORGANIZATION6 dot com.",
            "Also small given the small set of languages now.",
            "So this is my, this is my screen and also I think it's like not really. So the Bugs works yes, it's good. It's Firefox, but I'll try to rotating it.",
            "That's even worse.",
            "But I can scroll it. So actually after scrolling this is probably the what's it optimize for at the moment, right? Do you agree PERSON3?",
            "That's probably the wrong way, it would be better to have it optimized for being vertical, because then you have space for the subtitles. Now you are just, yeah.",
            "So PERSON3 are.",
            "Yes, as I told you we are working much more on functionality than on the.",
            "That's We're not complaining, so it's, I wanted to say this up front. It's it's great what you have already. We're, but we're thinking what are the minimum changes that would make it like much more usable with as little effort as you have. So, I think it's usable in the in the horizontal mode because then there is more, it's it's hard to say where is more space.",
            "Depends on how many languages you will want to see.",
            "Exactly. Yeah. So maybe I think you can for the cell phone usage it looks really good to me. I think it would be ok already now. For the desktops it would be better to have the subt the video larger.",
            "And it seems it works for the cellphone very well that it adapts to the size of the screen, I wonder why does the same code cannot be used on the desktop.",
            "Well, you know it's different, the browser used on the mobile phone probably. Well, actu I think probably at the moment the CSS is operate the same we have to introduce.",
            "To different ones.",
            "And I'm I'm not webdesigner.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But for the, this is the issue. If you like to have a bigger video screen text, I can note and I will ask them.",
            "Yes. I think.",
            "Available for June.",
            "Yeah, the shortest version of this request would be to not limit the with of the slides rectangle on the desktop. It should also happily use the whole the full width of that. Of the screen.",
            "But.",
            "There's there's the subtitles will be below that.",
            "Exactly. The problem is to let still the subtitle to be displayed. You also asked for having at least, well at the most using 2 languages available.",
            "And you support many more, which is good, I like that.",
            "Yes, it's pretty, it's it's nice, but of course they will require some kind of space. Yesterday we actually we tried for the full screen mode to prepare let's say a kind of overlapping, you know the, but we haven't found a solution and it's actually it's it's nothing in problem to, to develop it. And not for June, I'm sorry. But we reason about it.",
            "Yeah, and when I'm thinking of is, can you, could you, could you share with us the code for the not all, maybe not all of the presentation platform but like the bare bones which has the text thing, like the logic that converse the words to where is that being displayed? So, because you mention the number of where is that should be displayed. So there is some logic in your set up. So this.",
            "It's not the idea presentation platform the worker, in the worker logic. I'm not allowed to share the whole worker logic because actually we have a really complex project. And it's difficult to explain to someone else also how it work. But I can prepare some kind of snippet and I can share them for sure.",
            "So the reason I'm asking for this is the clie the console client presentation platform. Something which we could launch ourselves and the only thing it will be doing would be showing the text in terminal window. And this is something that would help us to use the video mixer if we use some transparent terminal on green screen. So like extracting this worker logic from your worker of the presentation platform would be very useful for us. For the purposes of the video mixing. Because it we could make it clie console operation worker.",
            "I'm reasoning about it because at the moment, the worker, the publi the publication worker returns exactly the packet recieved and not the one published. But maybe it could send back the published subtitles so that you can catch the subtitle directly from the client running.",
            "That's right, yes.",
            "The idea. Ok.",
            "Or maybe, maybe it's if it's easy I don't know how easy is it in the code, but if you could register the worker when you're starting the worker that feeds the presentation platform. If it could register itself twice, once by pro offering the dash pub thing, and that would be only copying thing exactly, and the other one would be like dash pub presented or whatever and that would be thing. Is that possible? So that the same worker would offer two output, one would be so that you can connect it and it doesn't change the stream and the other one would be the one that we could then directly use as the console client.",
            "I have to reason about it, I'm not sure about the answer, sorry.",
            "What is. Yeah, ok. So is there still anything that we need to discuss? So I think the most important thing for now is the map of the fingerprints. I'm not sharing my screen, I'll start sharing my screen again.",
            "Oh, yes. We'll be preparing the map.",
            "Yes. Allow. So I'm sharing my screen. So I think we need to make sure this set of languages is there. And we need everybody, so I'll ask everyone on the call today at 1 to contribute to this map and everybody needs to check that their workers are like signing themself with the right, with the right fingerprints.",
            "Yes, please consider that at the moment, the publication worker it's running on my local PC. When it will be sufficiently stable it will be deployed on asure. So please don't run a lot of test with it, because I'm also debugging and checking this functionality. So in general.",
            "Ok.",
            "In general I suggest you to forget about the presentation platform till Monday. So we can test and improve the functionality. And also check these nasty things of browser, Windows, so whatever.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Firewalls and whatever.",
            "Ok. So I think we're we should stop the call. Like I don't know how about you but I'm I'm getting exhausted. For, and I'm not sure if PERSON4 is here if he can hear us or not. Yeah, well.",
            "For Monday we say we say the time which was from?",
            "11.",
            "Ok.",
            "So I'll actually put it right into the at the beginning of this call. So Monday, and it will be what would be the date on Monday. Yeah, 17 6, and only and PERSON3 expected and the goal for Monday was to test more languages in presentation platform. Or what was the.",
            "Well, since I will not be available for part of the week, maybe we can try to let's say everything we have to check on Friday. So the multiple language fingerprint path selection and hopefully, of course the multiple publishing system on the presentation platform.",
            "Yeah and also custom different video. Different video streams.",
            "Ok.",
            "And the goal for Friday was the full work allow needed. I all audio inputs and all target languages in the presentation platform, right? I'm now editing the top, you're seeing it in my screeshare I guess. Yeah, so here PERSON2 and PERSON4 will be absent. Everyone else please come. Ok. I think that's it, right? We also need a break before the main. So Tyso, yeah so PERSON4, were you here? We don't know. I saw PERSON4 for a while, I'm not sure if he was here at all. Yeah. So PERSON3 thanks a lot. PERSON4 if you are here, thank you as well. But may with PERSON3.",
            "Yes. I'm sorry it didn't work today, but actually.",
            "That's it's no, you're pretty fire, this is perfect. This is this is very good, like I'm not really relieved yet, but. I'm not anymore nervous that I was before. Actually, quite on the contrarily. So that's that's good. Ok so thanks a lot and talk to you on Monday. And try to clean up the Google document this one, on the prepare to the calls if I misunderstood something or if there's if some of the notes don't make sense please make it explicit so that we, yeah. So that we know what is what is happening. Ok, Thank you PERSON3, I'll close the call now if I'm able to and we start packing things here.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye."

            "Yes.",
            "You know. And you?",
            "I'm also at home. But, the Czech republic government, they already lifted the. Kind of lifted the rules. So, from this Monday we can actually go out even if it's not like the necessity. It the meetings of. Up to 10 people are allowed.",
            "Ha. So here in LOCATION1, we have to wait until the 4th of May, some commercial activity can already be open. But we think that we have to wait until June for the free circulation of people. And fortunately, starting from the 4th of June we are allowed to reach our family. If it's in the same region.",
            "And so finally, I will reach my parents. Cause we live in two different cities. Because I'm in Trento and my family is in Bolzano. Which is pretty near around 50 kilometres. But, but -",
            "So you're looking forward.",
            "Yeah, exactly. Hi guys, good morning.",
            "Hi.",
            "Morning.",
            "So I went to the park yestreday and I was really happy. I mean I kept my distance from everyone but like it was green there. So it was.",
            "But you can't go to the forest or something?",
            "You can't just go to the forest or something?",
            "Well, the rules changed here and since this Monday we can't go out even if it is not like the most necessary groceries or stuff like this, and.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so.",
            "And thanks we are able to go out to the forest, whenever we wanted.",
            "Yes, but if you are in the city then you have to somehow get to the forest, so.",
            "Hello everybody.",
            "Hi PERSON13.",
            "Hi.",
            "Welcome.",

            "Hi. Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Sorry for the delay. So, Am I the last one?",
            "Probably yes, because ORGANIZATION3, PERSON3 and PERSON14 said that they have the call so they can't join ours.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And ORGANIZATION3 is not coming.",
            "Yeah. So we have every partner. A partner from everywhere, that thats great. Thanks for joining. So this is again one of our regular calls. There will be, before the summer, there will be at least one more, in May. Oh no, two more actually. One in May and one in June, and. Let maybe PERSON11 should start with the administrative part. Yeah. So, PERSON11, can you? You know the review day, then all this.",
            "Okay, so, we. PERSON7 told us that we will have to postpone one of our regular meeting. And she asked us about dates. So I already set it up. Well. Not many people voted in that Doodle. So, please vote for the postpone review. It should be in September. I know that nobody knows so litheraly if will be able to travel somewhere, and it looks like that it will be just online meeting. But, anyway just vote in a Doodle so I can get PERSON7 some dates. So, just do your best estimates for September. And that's it for that. We have we will have couple of deliverables due in June. I've link there in the in that Google sheet we have for tricking our like deliverables or stuff. We have the links for overview. So for these six up coming once you can basically start working on them. We haven't decided who will be our internal review person for any of them.",
            "Which is a good opportunity to choose them now.",
            "Yes. So just have a look. And if it's not your deliverable and you would like to read it just tell me.",
            "So we will be contribute. So I think that the two point one, the initial ASR systems ORGANIZATION1 is not providing in ASR system. And that's a technical We are providing some. So it will be good if ORGANIZATION1 review that. So actually PERSON10 the. The volunteer should be entered in the continues reporting. She not in this table just copy copy-pasted.",
            "You can you can enter it here and I will just put it into the right place. You can just.",
            "Okay, I'm gonna last review the summarization. But generally, there ASR also interesting for me. So probably put down PERSON10.",
            "Yeah. So I don't know, who should we the summarization review. Then that's another.",
            "So.",
            "I think we're not contributing that don't know facts.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There we should wouldn't not this stage.",
            "Okay, I would be happy to do the review.",
            "Okay, rage. What can we review? Is there anything that we can review?",
            "That's a problem we contribute everything.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And for this D7 2 do I understand correctly, PERSON11, please correct me. I think that we should ask for an extension for this deliver because Congress has not taken place.",
            "Yes.",
            "So actually, I hope that this one will not be needed. So.",
            "Yes, we will have to check it with PERSON7.",
            "So, who is gonna review three point one, cause I'm hoping that everyone only the universe is contributing three point one.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So maybe ORGANIZATION5 would be just a placed.",
            "Exactly, yeah. Because ORGANIZATION5 is also developing their own systems in this area.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There. So it would be great if ORGANIZATION5 did it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, you can sign -",
            "Let me down the check, okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON13 should we list your name or not? Or you will let us know?",
            "I will let you know.",
            "Yeah, okay. So lets put PERSON13 with two question marks. Okay. And then, then the management guy.",
            "Well, I think I could I could. Well, the dissemination activities I could do that but if we are not. But I'm also doing the dissemination on the web and stuff like that.",
            "I don't think there will be too much of a problem. So I think that little should be like cross reviewed between ORGANIZATION3 and us. So we should review what they wrote and they should review what we wrote.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So, PERSON11, write yourself as the reviewer and -",
            "So I will put here PERSON11 plus PERSON3.",
            "Yeah, and I have no idea of this project management guide is again.",
            "I'm -",
            "I think that will be checked an update.",
            "No, there is no, there wasn't any, anything like that before.",
            "Oh, this is the.",
            "Sum it. And this is the first one. So I'm apparently writing it.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it will be a lot of lot of words about nothing but yes. Yes.",
            "I'm afraid so.",
            "So who wants who wants to read a fairy tale.",
            "So the best position would be I think ORGANIZATION1, because they have coordinated a number of projects.",
            "I'm much rather read about ASR systems.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, not that keen on reading it to be honest.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I could, you know, I could say we have to if it's not many words. PERSON11 said it'll be lots of words.",
            "Yes, PERSON11, please cut down the number of words.",
            "Like I think will run out of idea what to write there. So it won't be really long.",
            "Okay. But maybe.",
            "But there must be, there must be some project management guide from previous project.",
            "I don't have it. So if you do you send to me.",
            "I, I do not know, I think we managed to avoid such a thing before.",
            "Why do we have it even?",
            "Even I do remember writing it on.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah well. Wasn't there anything like that from QT21 for example? I'll search.",
            "I mean. Yesterday I search in PROJECT2 like what is the description of this of this deliverable, and it says just czech management guide. There is no description.",
            "And this is the first iteration of that, is it?",
            "Yes. It is.",
            "And how it could be managing without project management guide so far if we don't. 15 months.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I mean, with PERSON8 we are awesome obviously. We can manage the project even without a guide.",
            "Yeah, it's just a party, they do what they're expected to do even without the managing them. So that.",
            "An exercise is so organized.",
            "Yeah, exactly, that's that's what PERSON9 can has always said I also believe in selforganization. So QT21 doesn't seem to have this. They have this period reports and data management plans but not the project management guides.",
            "And.",
            "I don't remember such a thing, no.",
            "So it probably it was copy-pasted from something from somewhere. And no whatever.",
            "Yeah, I don't remember.",
            "Okay, anyway, I'll write something and someone then will review it.",
            "So another thing is like who would like to coordinate future projects. Those people should also have some a little incentive to read it. So is any partner planning to do like start. Anyone who was not coordinated the projects yet. We could even ask ORGANIZATION3 to review that because there. So that they would finally know what like what these EU projects are about. Yeah.",
            "Okay, we can decided slowlier.",
            "Yeah. So it is important that they do start writing and the due date has not been shifting. So that would be the end of June. So the internal reviews should be ready by mid June at the latest. So that we have two weeks to finish that.",
            "Can you give us a date? Mid June seems kind of late.",
            "Okay, yes, exactly. Yeah, let's do it earlier.",
            "Especially things usually slept.",
            "Yep, yeah, yeah. So the 8th, the 8th of June.",
            "Yeah, that sounds fine.",
            "So that should be the end of the review, kind of, right? Or no. It shou. No, sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah. The beginning, the beginning. This should be delay. Yeah, yeah.",
            "It is the first draft.",
            "First draft, yes, but complete draft. Yeah, So then you basically have a week reviewer two week to fix it.",
            "Exactly yeah.",
            "And a week for no further every week spare -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "For final tracks from the coordinator.",
            "Yeah, okay, that looks good. So, then the milestone. So the previous milestones of talk to PERSON5 in the e-mail that you seen that of the milestones claiming that we have all the complete set up for ORGANIZATION4 Congress, which technically we have. So, yeah. And there is one more milestone, the Congress. And PERSON5 said that there is no need to like think that of specifically, because, well, it won't happen yet. So we will take it off in that year from now. So.",
            "Yes and another. Another the most earlier milestone is in December. So. Do we find have anyone milestone in December. And there will be. I forgot to put the one more deliverable. That will be due in the end of August. And that's the year 2 test set. So, that will be.",
            "Yeah. So the test sets, this is something that we are building. We call it the PROJECT1 test sets. So it is, I think the main responsible for this deliverable is ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON9 please, I have started this PROJECT1 test sets some time ago. You know, where the repository lives. So please pick up on that, and hopefully will not be like too confused from the layout of the of that test set and also that you would not disagree too much with the ambition that I have there. So it's, so this is this is technical thing no that me and PERSON9 should discuss. But, like my idea is that we should have this populated and described by the August date. So that the we can then easily like submit as a deliver. So if the if you want test sets are not part of this yet and I think they should be. So wish put them in, and we should put all the other languages, and everything. And we should also tested with our pipelines regularly. And the layout for those who are not following these details these the layout of the test sets is that. It's many documents, and depending on the availablity of the document. Some of the languages are available. Sometimes it's also ASR test set. So, sometimes there is also the speech. Sometimes that just runs quick. Sometimes there is, there is the. That was PERSON2, sorry. There is another meeting happening and I can't answer him now. So, it is and kind of assorted collection of documents in terms of languages, and like modality the speech, or the text. And whenever someone wants to test against it. They will select a subset of files which have the require set of languages. So the test sets consists of these raw documents, obviously, curated to serve well, linebay, segmented, everything. But the actual set of documents that you will test against will depend on the set of languages that you want to test. So the part of this repository is directory of file lists. And these file lists are then the subset of that.",
            "So this is the WMT 20 PROJECT1 test you are talking about, or?",
            "No.",
            "No, sorry.",
            "This is, this is PROJECT1 test set. Do you see that?",
            "Got it. Ou, Yeah.",
            "So please, this is like the starting point. And I have PERSON12 just should be really of like of coordinating annotators. The annotators are searching for poll documents and in many of the languages. We've asked that we have to have included more people we have any more people to the language map. And we have short term agreements with them. Unfortunately, PERSON12 is not feeding them with the prepared automatically paralyzed files. So that they would review them, because he is very slow, and he is also not soliciting new links from them. So that is it is. It is a growing much slower than I wanted to. We have enough time for August. But if we were really wanting this for the ORGANIZATION4 Congress we will be in a bit of trouble.",
            "So was the August the August just the low deliverable of the year 2 test set, is that right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, okay. And these are, okay - So these are documents or sentences or speech. It is everything really?",
            "Yeah, yeah. It is everything, but if everything is curated. So it is like constraint, when finished, they all should be curated for the particle purpose. So if it's the speech type of test set. It will be the sound, and the transcript with timestamps of individual words. That's what we are trying. We called it forced alignment. Sometimes we have to do it manually because the forced alignment automatic one fails. And if it's the machine translation test set then it's the standard poll think, ideally documents. We are trying to have documents, but sometimes it is the line oriented. So it needs to some still some clarification, like how do we like name the files. And then there is the file lists. And ideally, there would be automatic checks so that the everybody could check out this repository and run these checks. And then, with. It would check the number of lines, the length of the non emptiness, and everything all the format things. And also it would automatically be able to create the file lists. So the file list should be essentially like fine graph. You for those who like a clever fine graph so that you list all the files, and check that you have all the languages that you want. And with this fine graph the result of the set of files that you can test on. And that should be stored there as a fixed file list, so then in order to evaluate with the test set you would say I'm for the evaluation I use this particular version of my model, whatever, and I use this commit ID of PROJECT1 test set with this file list. And that uniquely defines what is what is the test set. And obviously, some of these subsets would be like stable ones. So that we would really have like there could be a file list cord called year 2 SLT test set. And year 2 empty test set and year 2 ASR test set. But that it would gradually grow as we will be covering more and more languages.",
            "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.",
            "So it's. It can be seen as an overkill but.",
            "And could be so suffered text to text can I do someone like sacrebleu or use well.",
            "So this is this defines just the data and not the evaluation metric and that's a separatelly.",
            "That, that and some as a true, but sacrebleu has a way to just yet be a text.",
            "So that would be a nice extension of sacrebleu, so that we could like add like FLAC to sacrebleu PROJECT1 test set and then the file list name, and it would do automatical downloaded and it would put the commit ID the current commit ID into the fingerprint.",
            "Yeah, and I, I have observed that Max apps test sets really quickly to sacrebleu. Okay, yeah, whether he was not all test set from PERSON7. I'm not sure.",
            "I mean, it's a little.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And so the I think it would be better to kind of avoid forks, because then the versioning is confused. But I'm totally agree that the public use of these test sets, the should be limited to few of those. And I think that the file list are the concept to use for this. So the file list, and, that there should be only 3 at most 3 file lists that are interesting for the general public.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But we need, whatever we need the particle, computational linguistics domain. We need the auditing domain. We need the text audits versus speech audits domain.",
            "So I think that for the for the general public there should be just at most 3 file lists. They could grow in time, the fingerprint would then it clearly indicate which version was used. And it would be downloadable by sacrebleu automatically. I can't hear you. There u something happen. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. That all seems good. I mean, I mean, the sacrebleu, I mean, I was insane added sacrebleu. I just mean this kind of approach is very useful cause it makes it very easy.",
            "Yeah. So for the evaluation it's for the tool, we're still working on the SLTF, which is a private repository and you can see it, but it will be public wants finally finalize it. And it's it is now under like have it testing for the audible SLT share task evaluation.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, we will know how the various scores behave. And it's this is geared towards the evaluation of spoken language translation, and it has kind of a mode, where it doesn't need a translation. So it's only ASR evaluation. The SLTF, ideally would be the sacrebleu for spoken English translation.",
            "Yeah, okay. I mean that. This is more interesting to me, because mean, essentially, I know I know how to text evaluation marks. And I know that's you just have some test sets you run you run whatever. Spoken language translation is a bit more but nearer to me. And then we have these problems are and simultaneous translation. Yeah, of an effect on the button translation.",
            "People I try to reconnecting if you needs.",
            "Okay. Yeah. PERSON15. Yeah, PERSON15 please go on.",
            "Spoken translation evaluation effect to reward the same unless you need symetrics.",
            "We do include latency. So SLTF does include delay and latency and also the well the wasted effort. So there is two measures of wasted effort.",
            "I haven't done that task on IWSLT to you.",
            "So.",
            "It was boring thing integrate the model itself to the wrong model and watch the output or.",
            "No it trust it trust the it trust the time stamps given by the participants. And in our case, we actually all we said that the primary evaluation will be the translation quality, and the ASR and translation quality regardless the delaying. So we also have submissions who do not include any time stamps, the others. So it is like a secondary thing. It was not a requirement for the audible SLT task this year. But I can imagine then in the next year, we would maybe even try running the model, so that this is a this is hard to run the models. But maybe we would really force everyone to submit time stamp information.",
            "So this is, for us, we need it in any case. So the SLTF should serve us like what is ideal set up. Evaluating latency.",
            "Yeah, I have strong preference not to submit my model to -",
            "To organizers to run it for one, because the unpublished code -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because it's python code I have no choice, but to send the actual source code. And yahoo it's not a problem and, I would prefer just send the sour the lock file we have to do, because with the something in translation task and probably the SLT and I was not able do that.",
            "Okay, but I mean, I mean how else do you. I mean if you want to save varieties these places is cautios so now, do you? How do you set this up?",
            "I mean, so used that's for lock former time stamps.",
            "Yes, this is exactly what we did for these for desirability to tasks it. It is quite clear, this cries what the lock file shouldn't lying.",
            "Mm-hmm.",
            "And then you trust the participants.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And there could be many lay. So this is all is risky with the lock files, because people still can misinterpret what time stamps should they use. So we try to be very clear about like this is the time when the award was starting to be authored. This is the time when the word stopped to be authored. And this is the time when its ASR was available like printed on the screen for the user. And this is the time when the translation appeared on screen for the user. But people can misinterpret and also the forced alignment that we're running. So the so the one people misinterpret it then someone's results can be like shifted in bad ways. So these measures will be always on the reliable, the only way to do the comparison really fairly is to run the models or a serve the model. So that people with really live, receive the sound, and they would like in actual networks sockets provide the outputs. So this would be the only reliable way to measure that. The extra thing that I wanted to mention is that the forced alignment, which finds the words in the in the sound is not reliable for us either. So sometimes it is really shifted. Sometimes it is towards the ends of the word. Sometimes it is toward the beginning of the words. It's in your own network model that like attention somewhat flows. It's not attention but it still somewhat floats, floats around. And the only thing that the one can say to this is the this at least affects everybody the same way. When people misinterpret what the locks should be. Then everybody's like each party is affected in a different way, and that's bad for the for the evaluation. But I think that's like that just life. So I think it is, it is quite easy to proceed with a with these limitations and what the set up. So the so ORGANIZATION1 people please review the PROJECT1 test set, as I set it up and please contribute to it in any possible way. You remember that some at the several months ago of I suggested that you can ask your students and PERSON10 said that well we cannot expect volunteers possibly paid volunteers or non-paid volunteers that makes some different, but not to it to just do slavery task on the data. Maybe you can find someone who can do it if you can paid them. That's okay, I'm not curious.",
            "Sorry just reminded the task is what? One is cur is checking the translations are making translations or?",
            "We do both. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So well, we plan to do both we. We try to, find, and the and the revised translations.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And this, if I was correct PERSON11 I do not know whether you have double checked my numbers. But it turns, it seems that finding and curating is half the price when we pay what we pay to our annotators normally compared to like the professional translation. So there is some reduction of costs but is. It's not like it doesn't come for free anyway.",
            "No, no.",
            "One could, one could. Yeah, it is war. And one could just trust the automatic processing and maybe use some quality automatic quality measures. So one could cut it down further. But for now, I prefer, especially because is this kind of obscure languages. I prefer to find people who actually speak them, and I preferred them to find the related data sets. But if we are unable to find speech domain and auditing domain. Then indeed, we will ask the people to find these text monolingually and translated maybe back to Czech. So do manual back translation to Czech. This is the wrong direction of translation. But it's the it's more reliable with respect the domain of interest.",
            "In terms of finding the translation I mean we and PERSON9 maybe can comment. We made some progress in getting translations out of the auditing websites.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And that if that is what we are looking for pro tests about is nonspeech segments, that some text insistent. This is that.",
            "Yeah. So this is relevant. And this is this is what we really should do. The current people, those that we have just like signed up work agreements, the short term contracts with, our four languages, which are not well represented there, so far. But we also want to do it for the well represented languages, because we should we should cover them as well. So PERSON12 sh PERSON12 has, for example, link to one great site of speeches and he should run by textor and they and he.",
            "We can also work on this and for a lot of Irish state. If you are under represent to languages.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The Irish supreme auditor, apparently translates lot everything into Irish.",
            "Okay.",
            "And doesn't very. It wasn't very structured way wasn't it though?",
            "Yeah, we got, what was it? And ten tens of thousands of sentences I think. Yeah.",
            "We assume that Irish was not huge priority for the project. But yeah.",
            "Well, Irish is equally equal priority with as other languages.",
            "Yeah, currently. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, well, the project was started when the EU still existed. So we will see what happened. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, there is one more point and we promised half hour call so.",
            "Yes, so exactly -",
            "Right.",
            "Yes, with this is that the finishes, the set of feel free to step in, and whatever you can do for PERSON12 that will help us then the next person when PERSON12 is still not like woken up is PERSON6 who is now finishing the overview of the audible SLT test set. And he will be moving to these like supervision and managing the annotators for the PROJECT1 test set if PERSON12 doesn't start really. And, but feel free to step in and provide feedback on the layout, upload data sets everything. So let's let's get this grow. And if we if we do this over the following couple of weeks. Then and if we test with these test sets then it will be very easy to do the deliverable for August. Yeah. And the last point now, that's the demo. So here I would I was I was hoping that PERSON13 would reconnect by this time. And yes maybe he is here. I'm not sure.",
            "Yes I'm here.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So would it be possible that ORGANIZATION5 would like manage and make sure that this demo is delivered? As the integration part. Obviously, like it's we will be PERSON2 will be running the systems. But I need someone to make sure that these things happen. Because I'm like overloaded and you're the integration partner. So that's that's the general question at the beginning. And maybe let's wait with the answer until I tell you whatever we know about this. There is no particular requests for the scenario. As far as I know PERSON5 has just answered and they have also provided some feedback and that's interesting for everybody. So they've they've reminded us off BBC guidelines and standards for subtitling, which we are aware off, but they are not reflected in our systems in any way. And then the better captioning or as spoken text translation on screen will make better translation and readability, recomposing sentence on the fly my ethic liability. So in a sense this is not the first time I hear that the users are always afraid of what ORGANIZATION7 is working on for the past years. So ORGANIZATION7 has been working on this retranslation approach. And the users seem to, to prefer a delay. Yeah, okay, so maybe ORGANIZATION7 has already experience with defending their approach to the users. I keep.",
            "This is the segmentation as opposed to the, you mean, the segmentation and -",
            "ASR have focused on resending.",
            "Okay, the retranslation, right.",
            "The retranslation, yes. I think the users are afraid of retranslation because we were not able to hide it sufficiently. If we are able to make the retranslation stable. Then the users will not complain.",
            "Yeah, I mean, we've been playing with this and we can certainly improve the stability. I mean we only tested this simulator ASR which talking this morning about trying to get more testing the ASR. Yeah, if you're doing retranslation you're never going to be up to completely make it stable without actually messing up the end performs. It's sort of a trade off.",
            "Yeah, it is a it is a trade off. So. I think that in the long term I would like this to be evaluated on humans towards the end of the project we would really have like user study that would be great to see which, and I think there will be people of different groups. Some will prefer this some will prefer that -",
            "Should be do this at the end or should be do this a bit sooner?",
            "Any time we have the time for that.",
            "Okay. Well, I mean it's a question that's it's a question of making the time. I mean, yeah, it's whether we see it as a priority or not.",
            "So it's that's a good idea. So we're now in the, in which of the project, it's where in the middle of the project, right.",
            "In the middle.",
            "So -",
            "I mean immediately end and say ou, we should retranslations a terrible idea. We should do less of it or we get the end and say retranslations is briliant. We should, you know, when you care about this. We probably are not learn up before the end.",
            "That's right.",
            "But I agree that way we for this. And I do not know.",
            "Well, okay. So little bit respect on this, I'm not an ASR person so probably PERSON9 could more about this. But it's entirely possible that retranslation go back a lot with the transition to end-to-end ASR.",
            "Because of course the unstable have are based on which our research. Multiplies already to the high get models. So it's entirely possible that pressure answer. So because we decided to go to the end the data.",
            "That you still have. We would still have instability. The MT is all also gonna inject instability, isn't it.",
            "No. The MT only translate will be get from ASR. Like every hand is also changes, we have changes otherwise that we have.",
            "Yeah, so that injects instability. So the MT.",
            "If there are no updated ASR hypothesis then they MT hypothesis.",
            "Okay, so if the ASR wait to the end of the sentence before sending his hypothesis. Then obviously this know instability.",
            "Partial sentences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's probably just going to get better as we train models in fact. We have lot.",
            "The search group, yeah.",
            "We will have our new generation of models previously based transformers finally in direct translator. And so far the experience from actual lectures is that there is a big improvement.",
            "Still I underst.",
            "And this is how much improvements is for flickering and every translation support generally, the quality is.",
            "Sorry, sorry. Go on. So I was I was double checking. PERSON15, you were saying that with the in the end-to-end SLT which includes transform models now in the new generation. There is, no, no.",
            "Not internal SLT.",
            "Okay, no internal SLT. Yeah, okay.",
            "And end-to-end ASR. I think he means.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, end-to-end ASR. So, end-to-end ASR there is no partial sentences admitted. It would be only complete sentences admitted. Is that what you say?",
            "Because that's not my field. I think there is a lot of research right now.",
            "Sorry, connection.",
            "Oh, I'm sorry. There is research going on right now. How to low latency, and when they ASR and right now. We do get a partial sentences, but I don't think the hypothesis updated as much.",
            "So they don't change, but they still extend. You know it doesn't rewrite extends.",
            "Much.",
            "But even extending could still could still lead flickering the MT it's like you listen to German. If you listen to German, you don't know what the verb it so you make prediction and reproduction wrong. German to English say, you don't know the verb is in the sentence predictor wrongly, or you could just wait, but maybe that's bad to.",
            "Yeah. Exactly. So this is, I think the problem with the integration of the ASR and MT will remain even once the, the new generation of the ASR models is there. And there will be the question for the users whether they preferred to wait for the German verb, or guess and put there some English verb. So there would be a trade off like what and what confidence should I insert the verb and then maybe recovery. I'm sure that there is also ways in English in which you can still.",
            "You can find examples and languages and say.",
            "No, no, no. I mean, that you could recover from that -",
            "To preforma, yeah, yeah.",
            "To preserve the stability and reintroduce some kind of correction.",
            "So why I wonder this when you could to look what interpreters do. Cause they just have strategies for doing this, the massive strategies where they serve formulate the speech and serve wheter the is open, but I don't know the computation like. And then there is the other aspect, which I think will be trouble for us. Like the system, even guess is what people are gonna to say, and translates sooner. And sometimes you can because you know the. So where is he asked for other word words. Sometimes You can guess to 90 percent. Yet should you do that? Because you may have maybe wrong.",
            "Yeah. So this is. We are trying to run GPT tool to predict the tail of the sentence.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But it so far. It's like, the ASR so bad that the prediction is like totally off, and so far it doesn't work at all, but we are trying this guessing. So maybe I think it totally makes sense to do this guesses. That's what the interpreters do. And that's a question whether we will be able to do it well enough and half a good enough confidence explicitely in the models to make the decision, whether we should follow this guess or not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So back to the demo.",
            "Back to finish.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the demo. The date should be. Where was that idealy May? 14th May 17th the sooner the better. And there is there is all this, all these recommendations for all the partners and their systems. But I think we should. There is no way to touch up on these topics before the demo. So my question back to PERSON13. Would could you, could ORGANIZATION5 supervise the organization of the of the demo? Obviously, asking all the partners to have their systems ready. And all that, but like doing the communication, so that successfully. That we delivered demo.",
            "Yeah. So we can. It's important is 17 than 4.",
            "Say it again, it's a.",
            "I mean it's important it's not a. Because it's too -",
            "Very soon.",
            "Too close to, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so they said, they said sooner is better. So maybe the best option send, so did closer to sending. So could it be like the 8th the so 11th seems like the average.",
            "We learn about quit couple of proposal in the.",
            "Maybe, maybe, so actually it won't be better if you could even create the Doodle Poll with time slots already for PERSON5. And directly con PERSON5. So like these are the time slots, which we are like offering. And then, well for all the partners it should be. Yeah.",
            "I think it's better if we post the final this proposal informaly as a Doodle and then ask PERSON5.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we will, we will learn set up the Doodle, send it to in both partners. Then once agree share with.",
            "Yeah. And also propose what you prefer to demo because there is. You send, you have seen the email. I've sent a couple of a like a recorded demo most to PERSON5 and propose, and something specific. It's up to us. So well, decide.",
            "Well, PERSON8?",
            "I saw the demo you send project officer and she mostly seen the Monday seminary.",
            "You mean the Czech talk, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, Okay.",
            "I, think that probably we if you would like to present to the same thing we should then everything right now put the same set up without the. It's also well tested by you. So it will be probably the safe solution. Might just, my only worry is about how to presents the results to the project officier. Because actually during the demo you project both the ORGANIZATION2 representation and the sub ORGANIZATION5 subtitles. In the future of the page on the projector in the class. And we will not vote to presente the same thing online to the project officer. Because actually are two different web pages, it's completly different.",
            "Yeah. So what we can do is like screen sharing and screen a broadcasting.",
            "Okay. It works.",
            "That is that is an option. And a question is, what should be the material that we are that we are subtitling.",
            "Well.",
            "I think it could be some low like French watching session.",
            "Yes to the ASR domains.",
            "That was quite challenging.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I'm not worrying about this, they have the same process on subtitling. And not really doing subtitling at the moment, we are doing transcription and translation, which is not subtitling by some kind of summarization. Sometimes. Which we won't do. It just about managing expectations.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That's true. So the translation, transcription and translation. And in that case, that's the paragraph you, which we can include in the demo as well. So I think the demo should demo both.",
            "I think the idea screenshare is a good one. Just takes away one indicate.",
            "Yes.",
            "Completely your own. Yeah, yeah.",
            "But the live aspect there. So what the, yeah, what was the challenge on the French watching session that we didn't understand the source language.",
            "Yeah, we didn't, to be honest, someone PERSON4 understood. What the topic was. And you didn't really understand, and I didn't. You talk about the item, didn't. Understand so well, I have trouble with it as well. So it was quite hard to follow have to met.",
            "Yeah. So that's that's a safer way of selling what we are doing. I've already, yeah.",
            "Some like a TED talk suppose might be. Little bit to save, is it?",
            "No, no, It's not necessary to save. So it could be authentic stock, or something like that, so that it's not delivered in English, the prime language. So maybe if the primer language would be German, because ORGANIZATION7 has good models for this. And from German into English and from English into all the languages, TEDx talk.",
            "Is the audio gonna be easier and gonna be clearer than news broadcast is gonna be easier for ASR.",
            "I think that the segmentation would be a little bit easier. But, Well, I don't know. Sentence segmentation. So what so far in our experiments what kills the performance for the final user of the machine translation is the sentence segmentation.",
            "We have new models now as well.",
            "Is it just cause sent me I mean because fundamentally sentiments segmentation is really hard, because people just you're trying compose something that is not really there cause I'm not speaking in sentences.",
            "I think that many of the. There are many errors. So yes, there is this hard concept. But still, there are many cases where I would simply nowhere to put the full stop. And the system does not put it there.",
            "Okay. So it is about partly by having better models.",
            "Yeah. So maybe PERSON15 he could propose some German talks that are, on this and we should test the whole set up via English into all the languages.",
            "Yes. I can do that in next week, I can't that this week.",
            "Say it again. It will be when?",
            "It will be next week.",
            "Yes, yeah. So. So the communication about the day should be already like that to start internally immediately. Then early next week, we should sent an email to the PERSON5 to truce, his date. And that would be towards the end of the next week, we should be ready for that. And in the week from the 11th, the sooner the better. We should run it life for them. And before that we should run it for ourselves, right?",
            "Mm-hmm. Um-hum. Okay.",
            "Yeah, Okay so. Sorry for not managing the half an hour. Thanks for joining, and will be in very close touch for the demo in the coming days.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye. Bye."

So, first, something, some organational stuff. There will be call on Thursday, you probably received the email from PERSON4 already. I think at least me, and PERSON2 should be present, right? Anyone else if, if they want to join, like, there's no problem with that. But I don't think it's completely necessary. It might be good for PERSON10 to get more insight into the project itself, I guess, but again it's –",
            "Sorry, this is, this is a meeting on Thursday?",
            "Oh, yeah. So, so, this is a call we have usually every month with the, other project partners. I'm not sure, did you receive the e – mail from PERSON4?",
            "Not sure, I'll check this, because, I didn't see it at first.",
            "That's the good thing to check, because, otherwise we, we should add you to the maidli – mailing list at least. Because it's possible that you're not added yet.",

And also, PERSON1 asked me, to tell you PERSON10 that you s – you should think about the possibility that – Basically, the moment the travel restrictions are, going d – go down. We w – we would really like you to come visit us at least for, I don't know, for some limited time. So, so, try to think about this, as a, as a, as a mandatory visit. Like, I'm, I'm not sure how, how it would be handled. Like, the travel cost as such. How – You, you don't know, how, how is it going to – So, so, here's PERSON1.",

            "Yeah. So, I just – This is a remark, that actually comes from the, like, personal department. And, the way they employed you, is really, like, they, they had to close both of their eyes. And, the – they are not going against the law, but they are, in a gap of the Czech law. So, they really take it as a, temporary solution what they have now, for you. And, it is important for you to come in person to, enter a proper work contract. So, th – the hosting agreement and other paperwork that is being prepared really has to be used, as soon as you can, and as soon as you can arrive. And, the length of your duration, I would prefer you to stay here but I know you, that you, initially indicated that you would like to stay, remote, if possible. So, just please keep that in mind. And, it would be better for us and better for the project if you decided to take it as an opportunity and not as a, as a negative must. As a negative duty. But this is negotiable. You, you will have to come, for the paperwork and then you can possibly return and, and work remotely. But, it would be b – nicer and better, if, if you decide to, to stay here in person.",
            "Okay, great.",

            "I think we will keep you updated, when we will –",

            "Yeah, so, the letter is.",
            "That is a paper that has to be shown to the ORGANIZATION4 when you are applying for the visa. And I believe that the ORGANIZATION4 is still closed, isn't it?",
            "Oh, I, I, I'm not sure about that. I'll have to check this.",
            "If you please start checking, what would be the process for you to apply for, for visa. And the paperwork, will come from PERSON8. So, check with PERSON8, what is the status, of that. And, yeah. I, I think that you at the moment, you cannot apply simply because the ORGANIZATION4 is closed.",
            "Okay.",
            "But that – I know this for the Indian ORGANIZATION4 because we have other people who are trying to come here and they really want to come, is from India and they cannot. So, I'm, I, I'm, I fear that the same situation is for LOCATION1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, keep checking and –",
            "Okay.",
            "We will also, occasionally check for you and as soon as you can apply for visa, then please go for it. And you will get the full support from the university, the, to show them papers they need and, and so on.",
            "Great, great. Okay, I will, I'll keep checking and as soon as I can, I, I go.",
            "Yeah. Thanks.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Okay, so, so, I think that's care of the – That's it for the organizational stuff. So, now for the progress, okay. Can we start with PROJECT3? Or I'm looking at it, at we are still waiting for – How, how is it with ORGANIZATION3? Do you have any updates?",
            "As I. Yeah. So, last week. I, nudged, PERSON9 that he should do something and then, yeah, he, he starts to or like finish testing it and thanks to PERSON3 for resolving all the issues that, that like PERSON9 came across. And raised again and, yeah, because we, we were at the time we, were at the wedding and like after the wedding. So, so, thanks to PERSON3 for like resolving this. And then I replied to him, I mean to, to PERSON9, on Friday and I have no messages from PERSON9 since last Thursday. So, I again, the same situation, I don't know whether they started it or not.",
            "We can definitely raise that on the Thursday call, maybe it ne – The thing that the communication is not completely perfect and. It, it's sort of like a –",
            "Like it i – like it is fine, but, yeah. The problem is that, I think like PERSON9 raises issues, new and new issues.",
            "And yeah. So.",
            "Yeah, so, definitely we can at least –",
            "There is also, some objective problem with the quality estimation or I, I don't know maybe. Maybe PERSON3 has more for this.",
            "We can't hear you.",
            "Expiring. But that is not this.",
            "We can barely hear you, PERSON3.",
            "Sorry.",
            "So, what?",
            "I cannot hear anybody now, so.",
            "No, no one is talking, right.",

            "Sorry, is it better?",
            "Yeah, yeah, now it's better.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, sorr – So, to comment on that, the certificate, on the server of that plane who does the just expired. And transfixed it and that's it. And now, the state is that, PERSON9 is preparing the leaflets, he would be handing out to, to participants and that's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, now we are just waiting.",
            "But –",
            "Yeah, something that he could prepare three weeks earlier and yeah.",
            "Or three months ago, yeah.",
            "Or three months ago.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So, hopefully next year we will publish a paper.",
            "Okay, so, so, next, let's go to PROJECT1. I think that, the, the bullet point is quite explanati – Like, what's the term. Like, I, I, get what, what, what is the progress right now. Like you, you're trying the back translation, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, that's the, that's the forty jobs that's are, that are on the cluster, or?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like I've notice that you –",
            "That's it. But they are a low priority, so, you can – They are just minus one hundred priorities, you can skip them, if you, if you need.",
            "Okay. But they are, they are already running, right?",
            "Yeah, but, every job takes two hours, so –",
            "Oh, okay. So, it's fine.",
            "So, it's nothing that –",
            "Yeah, yeah, that's, that's quite –",
            "If you, if you secure your own job like in two hours, it will be on.",
            "Okay. Okay. I hope so.",
            "So, ok, so, the – Let's, let's, let's – Yeah. It's, it's progress. Like, is there any, was there any issue, something that needs to be discussed?",
            "Not yet. Like –",
            "Ok.",
            "Yeah, we have to like in this week, I have to, discuss things with PERSON7, what should we do next.",
            "Okay, so, the, the –",
            "I will also, maybe run this, translation on CPUs, because there are many CPUs that are now not used, so, just to, make it quicker.",
            "So, I guess that leaves us with the PROJECT4. Like, any, any updates?",
            "Yeah, no. No mo – updates for now.",
            "Oh ye, w – Oh yeah, we already discussed right that you're, you're, you're s – still catching up with the state of the art. Actually, actually, I was read, I was, well not reading, but I, I skimmed through the paper on the BLUE. And if I understood correctly, they were basically training a model to do the, evaluation, right? So –",
            "Yes, the metric, yeah.",
            "So, the thing is that it might be useful, but I'm not completely sure whether we would like or how w – Whether we can use it for the evaluation itself. I'm really, like always s – sceptical to these machine-learned evaluation methods, right? Because they might be sensitive to domain shift and, and such, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So, even if the method tells, the score or the performance is low, it might not be actually true. But, yeah, I, I'm thinking that, that it might be implemented into the pipeline somehow, but – I – in my case, also, I, I, I, don't know, don't know exactly how we can add it or include it right now. But that seems like –",
            "The problem – Sorry.",
            "And it, it seems that it ma – might be useful that the, the approach they, they take there in the paper, so, so, definitely good thing to keep that in mind.",
            "Yeah. The, the problem is that if, the decoder generates a sentence that is, has the same meaning, but different words, maybe we have a problem trying to use just blue, right? So, can try do both and check the differences and, and stuff. Or I don't know.",
            "Yeah, d, yeah definitely. I think that the idea – I'm not sure – Like they, they, their argument about the metric being semantically sensitive, or what's the term?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Like the argument is that the PROJECT5 is actually creating semantically rich representations, right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, yeah. I think if we, if we sort of maybe take the pretrain model and, and fine – tune it during training it might be actually useful for, for this kind of distinguishing. Like, right, I guess with paraphrasing or if we use it for example for paraphrasing, we might use the metric to, estimate the sim – sim – simil – like semantic similarity, but still have the constraints to enforce some, some like surc – surface form. Distinction or something like that, I guess. Like that's, that's, that's the thing that comes to my mind, but, again, I also, need to look into it in more, in more detail.",
            "Okay, yeah. Okay.",
            "Maybe just like my stupid question, why do we need this eva – new evaluation for MT? It's, because of that, like case of paraphrases, that bo, is in fact measuring the similarity, not the diversity, or?",
            "No, so, I, I can –",
            "Why do we need like another like non – standard metric? For evaluation?",
            "Well technically we can use it either for – Well, yeah, probably for the paraphrasing, right. And the thing is that we want to kinda guarantee a semantic similarity, right, which BLEU doesn't capture, because it's just using the surface forms during evaluation. But on the other hand, we like again, we can, we can force the system to choose different wordings, different phrases and this kind of – And this blurred metric can be used to guarantee that the, the, the paraphrase or the alternative sentence does not straight – stray away from the original meaning too far, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So –",
            "So, d, sorry, just complementing. The idea is that w – we could add as many, as many constraints we want and, and see ho – how many can we add until we lose the meaning completely.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So – We check the point where it changes, where it starts making no sense.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I, I think, I think that we can focus on this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds like fine.",
            "Yeah, I, I don't know it was, addition idea that I think that we can work on for now until we have new ideas.",
            "Yeah, this is – this definitely sounds interesting, because again, I think that the papers that do focus on the constraint decoding, they, they really don't evaluate it from this perspective, right? So, that would be the valuable, thing, yes. Still, still, I guess the metric can be, can be useful during the, let's say, some, some fine – tuning or development phase. And maybe later when we are ready to publish the paper, we should definitely still, generate some subset –",
            "Evaluate manually.",
            "Yeah, yeah, definitely. But we, we can talk, talk about it, or consider it later. Yeah, so, that's, that's a good start. I'm not sure, do you want to have a longer meeting this week t – about the PROJECT4, like? You have –",
            "I don't think it's necessary, at least, y – it would be today, right? After this one.",
            "Ye – well we can, we can, yeah. We can still discuss the matter after the meeting. I was thinking, yeah – Okay, later, let's keep it that way.",
            "Oh, but I – It's up to you guys. I'm, I, I'm okay, I will keep, until I have new ideas or new alternatives –",
            "Okay. So – Well – Let's pu – put it this way, like, if you, if you don't have a – anything to discuss, we can leave it at – Like leave it b – let it, be it for this week. And, I'll, I'll try to ask PERSON1 and we, we should, we should try to have a, a meeting for the task next week together with him. So, he can, he can give us hi – his opinion too, right?",
            "Okay, yeah. I'll try to give – to have some ideas until them – to maybe an alternative to the alternative, okay?",
            "Ye, well but then I think like this, this might be a good, good approach to the, to the task. We'll, We'll see, we will see how much time it will take, depending on the, on the, on the time consumption, we can then, shift to, additional or another, another research direction. Like – but, again, that depends, we will see how, how this develops. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, okay, good. Seems that we've discussed everything we needed. So, we can – Again. I'm sort of really bad in English today. But yeah, we can, we can wrap it up, and I guess see you, see you next week, right? Or is there anything, else you would like to discuss, any of you?",
            "No.",
            "No.",
            "Okay, so, yeah. Thanks, thanks for your time and see you next week.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Okay, see you.",
            "See ya.",

            "So PERSON7 we have discussed with PERSON8 your negotation. And we are talking about how to implement the negotation. PERSON8 prepaired some crieteria, so the guidelines for the evaluation. But they are not fully ready yet so as far as they will be ready she will share it with us. And well, just reference.",
            "Also are there any links to them for the menu of the evaluation thing?",
            "What?",
            "Are there any links to that of the. Ye, for the manual evaluation thing. Are there any links that we can see or what?",
            "PERSON8 is searching for some reference to the evaluation. PERSON8?",
            "Ye, I am searching I did hadn't half of the copy of it. And I am finding.",
            "Okay. And I had so many papers to find.",
            "Okay, Take your time and maybe as you have it just paste it please.",
            "Ye I will, I'm just finding it.",
            "So I actually wanted to talk to PERSON2 today and he planned to join us. But i don't see him up at the moment. So PERSON7 did you manage to upload. Ayeye. Did you manage to upload the ORGANIZATION3 sources? Was it okay? Did you try to make the alignment script?",
            "I did with you PERSON5 for like I have to collect the minutes so. I don't understand this upload thing.",
            "Well not upload, so did you do something with that already?",
            "Ye, ye, so, the thing is like I'm starting the I'm starting the web that how to croll those minutes. And how to like find what is actually there in the ORGANIZATION3 corpus and how we do that link with the web. So that kinda need to understand first. And I'm also in touch with PERSON3 because he has done.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I just connected with him and maybe will be skipping meeting later this week. So.",
            "With PERSON3?",
            "Ye, ye, with the PERSON3, ye.",
            "Okay, so this is clear. What should we disscus today else. What else should we?",
            "I just want to know a few things from you regarding that ORGANIZATION3 website maybe you can guide me.",
            "Yea. I'm not sure, okay I will try to.",
            "Okay, so from the source like from the transcripts that we have. Can you look at the minute in the website?",
            "Yes, so for each transcript in ORGANIZATION3 you can find the minutes.",
            "So can you just show me that? Can you just share the screen.",
            "Ye, if you see the gender. This is the link to the from 9. from 9. October. I will copy paste it to the today's gender. So that you can also open it. I will show the screen.",
            "Ye.",
            "Can you see it?",
            "Ye, Ye.",
            "Ye, so if I follow the link I may open this search for minutes, here's minutes, and here's a search. And I am searching recent the years. For example 2009 to 2014. And let's search for some name. And the name could be from if you go to the data, ORGANIZATION3 data. Let's find some. Let's find some meeting from 2011 for example. And we can look in the title. Just copy paste it and search. I didn't find it I don't know why.",
            "So it might be in the other range, so the ORGANIZATION3 script is from 9 to 14 I guess. That must be in other range.",
            "No I found it, but yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, this is the one, there were certain additional to that. So this seems to be the one. Six, oh maybe. Yes, so you can see, six 2011, this is six 2011. And here you can see that this name corresponds to chapter eight year, sixteen. And this is here, you just click on it.",
            "So once you open it we get the minutes?",
            "Yes, now, here are the minutes.",
            "This is just the minute right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay. I don't know if this website has gotten index of the minutes just like it had for the transcripts.",
            "Which index, the index does not correspond. Because the indexes here, these ones correspond to the court was not the whole ORGANIZATION3. And here we are so on the web we are within ORGANIZATION3 website. And here we are not on within the ORGANIZATION3 website. We are within the corpus created for machine translation purposes.",
            "Ye, ye, ye. So I think this corresponds with manually verified this corresponds cause this one is a.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So chapter that is 16 is also like 16.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON5, I have linked the reference in the agenda. They has on the intereface maybe you can just have a look. So they have shown snapshot of the interface.",
            "I can't open it. Oh, no sorry is my.",
            "There are two links, one to different links.",
            "What is that? This is some paper.",
            "Ye this is some paper, they have shown the interface. So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the. So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool.",
            "But what should I do with that?",
            "You can see the snapshot. How they have built this tool for annotation of the valuation.",
            "This is from ORGANIZATION2, oh, interesting.",
            "This PERSON6 is a colleague.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Where is the snapshot?",
            "Yea at the end, at the end of.",
            "There were some interface and the example of it can be shown. Which can be delivered to the human annotators.",
            "Which figure is that?",
            "You have opened Fact-based Content Weighting? Or Evaluating Interacting Summarisation? First link or second link?",
            "Fact-based.",
            "Okay, so in the fact-based the figure number. After the in the after the references you can find that.",
            "Entry aha.",
            "Number two.",
            "Yes, this one says looking at now. Yes?",
            "Yea, they have an interface. But this paper does not have their base interface as a meeting. The interface we haven't shown it.",
            "Okay.",
            "It is the based our it is not by base. We haven't mentioned it. But the other paper they it is it is.",
            "This one?",
            "Are you sharing your screen?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yea. If you could just scroll down after the references. Yea.",
            "There is anything, where is it.",
            "Yea, so I wanted to show you that here itself in on page number.",
            "This blue one, yes?",
            "Ye, at the bottom implementation details. Ye, see. Can you see this web application I just retry it. Web develop this web application for the front-end.",
            "No.",
            "They have just in this diagram. They have just it is not shown the transcript and the summarisation. But this is just a web application which they have shown the snapshot. But in the implementation details they have mentioned the entire thing. That where they have this summary and transcript which they have put in the web application.",
            "Now you speaking about which figure.",
            "So I'm this is the interface which can be seen in web application.",
            "Where?",
            "The blue one. It does have web application front-end which. Ye the figure number two. The figure number two. They have they have given this for user ratings. As you can see from the description of the figure. So it needs somebody with the user rating and user queries. This is query and summary based system. A little different than our. But they have the for the ratings they have this web application.",
            "So you propose to make something like that?",
            "So I and if you see to like after the references can you just go after the references? After the references theres a before this yea before this. There is a section. B section and B. B section. Yea, yea. So this practical task, ye. Here, ye this page. Just scroll down. Scroll down a little PERSON5, ye. If you can see here they have this Evaluation Session Collection. So they have these cautions. Which the humans human annotators do answer. That how usefull was the summerization and all these cautions. It starts from the previous page. Maybe you can see the previous page as well it.",
            "Yea so if you can see the Trap Task. There are different cautions which are answered by annotators. And how good is the summary. So they have this entire web interface. So we will disscussing whether we should have web interface or something. So this is a paper from 2020 September. Recent paper. So I told you that what i reviewed from the various papers regarding the evaluation. So regarding evaluation matrix some of them have the their interface as a fact-base. And some of them does not have. So I just wanted to show you how what kind of people. What kind of manually valuation people are performing for the summarisation systems.",
            "Okay. So they are giving some set of cautions to the annotators. And based on the web. There are annotators are asking by scene board the transcript and the summary.",
            "Well, fine. I'm totally happy with that. So if you create something like this. This is very good.",
            "Okay, so I will form this airdraft and send you and please finalize. And then I will do the implemetation.",
            "Yes thank you. Yes thank you.",
            "So I just wanted to confirm that is the web base good for us or something else is. Are you expecting something else like.",
            "No, we are not expecting any specific. I think you just come up with what you consider to be the best. Taking to any.",
            "In the state of or what is. So what you've already done is very beautiful. So you have some papers, you have confirmed fact-based. And non web based and have chosen web base. So it's totally okay if it works.",
            "Yea, even I wanted to ask the contented would it would it be good for shared task. Because I think the annotators will be able to evaluate it in a better way. If you just have web base interface for manually evaluation. What do you say?",
            "I want to understand the work for first. How would it work.",
            "Like beginning. How would it work.",
            "So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface. So we build inteface which shows the transcipt and the summarisation. And then the annotators do give rating to it. And that awaited score can be calculated automatically. So the annotators do not have to compute each and. Because there are so many minutes and the ones which are generated. So the annotator cannot do it manually each equation. The start system which we made. So building an interface for it would be a good thing. Would it help our shared task.",
            "So I just want to understand that supposed we have the interface. And we will have the questions for while which the annotators would. Would replay. So do you want to do it for all the data.",
            "Yea, yea, yea. All the data.",
            "You mean the train test where you just share everything, yes?",
            "Yea, because the main purpose to build this manually evaluation. Is to help by shared task, right? So.",
            "Yea, I would like to understand how. How, how.",
            "So how will we evaluate the generated minutes by the participants.",
            "So that's what I'm asking. So thank you for the prooving details we already for the testing data.",
            "So what do we want? That's what I'm asking that what do we want for shared task. Do you want it for training data. Or you want it for both?",
            "I'm still not sure how the manual evaluation work mutely. I don't unders. We have a very set of questions here. So that is that is really like depending on a writer. And maybe we need that early. So that we can see and we can agree that. Okay, based on this question. This is a good summary and this is a bad summary. Can we do that?",
            "Ye, ye, we can do that. Maybe I will I will send you a both draft. And you can just see to that. And that's what I was asking that building an interface would be a good thing. And will it help our shared task. Because interface would a better thing. Like doing it manually. Just building the guidelines and heading forward to annotators. I don't think that would be a good thing but. Building an interface and giving them the link of the interface. So they can just evaluate it. That could be better.",
            "Ye, interface is fine. Interface is fine. I'm absolutely okay with the interface. But before the interface we need to be sure about that. Rating scale that we have.",
            "Ye, ye, this is what. Yea.",
            "That is that is. Because once we have the rating scale. I'm absolutely okay with the inteface. But it is at the annotator's task. But first what are the question ye. What is the rating scale. What are the rates to each of the questions. And then we have very cris example that what is a good summary and what is a bad summary. So, once we haven't have that. We are okay with the interface.",
            "Ye, that's that's that's what PERSON5 and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized. And then we can.",
            "The drafting yes, the drafting is very much boring. The drafting from our link is very much boring. When you start the manual evaluation question there or maybe is that you are suggesting. Or maybe what PERSON5 suggested. So that should be clear soon. Ye.",
            "So let me share the draft maybe. And then you will all please have a look on that. So I was reading the paper how to actually add interface some constant values. In that equation. And there's something I'm reffering to it. I'm reading the papers because I have some more measures into it. Like coherence and read ability. To three more measures. Which people were considered a lot in their summarization systems. So actually multiplying them with the constant value is thing to be decided. Okay so I will send the.",
            "So as I underst. Understand so the coherence with the read ability and all these scores. So that would be the human judgement, right?",
            "Yes. What is automatically going to be is. So humans are going to read on the cautions one to five. And the equation will be computered automatically.",
            "Ye, ye that.",
            "I would just like to add. I'd like to add that it would be that it is very hard work to make these evoluations. So probably. It will so it will take much very much time and very much effort.",
            "For the annotators?",
            "Yea.",
            "So yea, but PERSON5 I think we need this in another way also. Because to compare our automatic matrix.",
            "Yea, ye definitely. But.",
            "Yea, so that we know that.",
            "And anyways it has a sense to speak about it after we see your criterias.",
            "Yes, yes. So should I make a different.",
            "PERSON8. Ye PERSON8 please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.",
            "Okay. So PERSON5 can you can you please do me a favor. Can you choose some two minutes which are easier.",
            "So you want two different.",
            "Yea two small minutes so that I can evaluate based on the measures. PERSON5, do you have any example how my cautions do work on a minutes.",
            "Yes I will.",
            "Maybe we all can.",
            "This is a good thing.",
            "Maybe we all can do like. We all can annotate a single minute and then we will see based on PERSON8's criteria. Or audience criteria with judgement we all -",
            "So we all three we will judge not draft the minutes. We all of us will get.",
            "Judge, ye.",
            "Yes, everybody.",
            "With the transcript, ye.",
            "Yea, we will get transcripts and two different minutes. And we will judge.",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "I will prepare it, I will prepare it.",
            "Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft.",
            "Yes. So we may have conflicting opinions regarding the judgment. But that is good to finally freeze out something.",
            "Yea, because anyway, if we do have annotators. They are also gonna have the same thing. Because if you give to ten annotators. Definitely they are also gonna have judge.",
            "So PERSON5 I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right?",
            "Say it once more, please.",
            "So currently we are not going ahead with the alignment thing.",
            "No, if you don't know anything me neither.",
            "I think for the first. Yea, I think for the first shared task I would like absolutely keep everything as simple as possible. And then once we have experience on that. We go ahead with some innovations or novelties based on that. And also the response from the participants.",
            "Yea, well I.",
            "So I would like to ask PERSON8. PERSON8, if you have any progress on the automatic part?",
            "No, no I don't have. Yea, I do not have any progress with the new thing. I did implement all of the existing to matrix. But not something new.",
            "What are those? What are those? What are the pr.",
            "So some eval and the one was the another paper. So I implemented the all the beginning of the paper. But I didn't do something new. So I was facing difficulties in those quotes only. So I did. It took me really long time to fix that.",
            "Okay, so can we just about that.",
            "About the papers which?",
            "Yea, no, I thought the matrix that you that you did.",
            "Okay, so I maybe link the papers which I implemented. In the agenda.",
            "Yea, okay. So did you try with our data or some other data?",
            "Yea, so I did try with our data. That is one thing which I'm insure towards small portion. But I do insure it with the. So this is only a new thing which I'm doing. I'm trying to do it with our data which. Also the summarisation which I'm implementing. I'm doing it with our data and not the ORGANIZATION1 and the PROJECT1 corpora. So.",
            "So on our paper do you have any figures that how the matrix work.",
            "So I haven't made my matrix until now. It's really something.",
            "Yea, sorry, yea I mean. Until now.",
            "Existed.",
            "Okay, so do you have any insights that how those work?",
            "So how do they work? Maybe you can refer to the link.",
            "Okay.",
            "So I think you also might have done the papers I think. There are only three four papers on this.",
            "Evaluation.",
            "Yea, evaluation. One is some eval so you also might also have come across that. Did you?",
            "Yea, ye, ye.",
            "I have sent you the meeting with one transcript and two short minutes.",
            "Okay, thank you so much PERSON5.",
            "And when PERSON8 need to share the evaluation criteria and we would all would annotate.",
            "Yes, yes, sure.",
            "Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align. We need not to worry about the data sights because if we.",
            "Yes. One more note to that. If we are able to align minutes and transcripts automatically what. This is what you are doing PERSON7 at the moment. Then this is not a big difference to make much more data from all the years. So I don't know if it makes sense but probably technically it will no. These are already exemples these transcripts. And the minutes are also available and if they are. Even automatically extractable it may have sense to extract all the meetings that are available. Then the data set is even more. Not just europarl.",
            "So you mean. So you mean the europarl. Okay, okay so you mean that.",
            "So not just this 6 years but all the years.",
            "Yea, but let us draft for the 6 years. And see how it looks like. So one thing PERSON5 so you buy alignment so I'm like getting a little bit confused. But alignment you mean that within a folder for one meeting. You have the ASR and the minute, right.",
            "Yes, so to find for each meeting.",
            "Okay, because for.",
            "Each transcript finds its minutes this is the.",
            "The minutes, yes. Because I did know we were talking about alignments between the transcript and.",
            "No, no, it's different.",
            "So yea, so let's not be.",
            "Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.",
            "Right, right so okay.",
            "Okay, somehow you didn't push us away today so they granted us woth extra time.",
            "No it's about to end in two minutes.",
            "Okay, aha well fine. So let's finish it for today.",
            "Yea I think yea. And PERSON8 and please also send the automatic evaluation that the paper of want to. And we can also like discuss it offline.",
            "Yes, yes, sure, I am just linking them. So I have them on the cluster also. So maybe I can. The implementation I've done on. I will I will link them in five minutes I think just opening the.",
            "Yea, sure, sure, okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Okay, thank you, bye, bye.",
            "Okay, goodbye."

            "So lets wait short while for a short while on because I hope that PERSON13 would join. She went for lunch an hour ago, and then I hope that someone from ORGANIZATION3 can actually join. I know that PERSON11 is teaching at this very moment. Would she learned only during the morning. Yeah, hello PERSON13.",
            "Hi, guys.",
            "Yeah, so while we are waiting if PERSON12 reacts actually. So I do not know, if he will join the call or not. Could you please tell us about the presentation platform, which now requires password. So what should we use to the see anything.",
            "Yes. I'm going to share with you on the.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Okay username and password the authentication fees has been reintroduced so that only people participating in the event are allowed subtitles. At the moment, there is only one user. Which is the. Which is the administration one. And he, hes the user allowed to assist to settings. You will see live testing username which is kind of email lets say. Its not a email its something I invented by myself. And the second one the PROJECT1 2019 is the password.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "We can register a new user. But lets say the credentials provided to people paricipating to the workshop, we can use just one credential for all of them. So that we are not recording user data which is retty sensitive information. We'll create new the credential for simple end users. Just and provide me something which sounds reasonable for you. Yes, but something si. I suppose something related to workshop.",
            "So does it have to be in include the at sign or not.",
            "Well when I prepared the Admin User, they asked me to include the act sign, actually, I do not know. But hopefully.",
            "So I would propose PERSON4. Password 2019.",
            "Okay. I'm going to register also these credentials and just being, yeah.",
            "Yep. And you know PERSON5 is around at the moment because he said that he restarted, the publishers and the they failed. So what could that be also related.",
            "The publishers are running right now.",
            "Okay. So. That is no longer problem on the publishers. So the only real problem that we have the blocking problem is from ORGANIZATION3. And we don't have anyone from ORGANIZATION3 at the moment, right? Yeah. So PERSON13, are you listening.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. One thing that is that like introduces the, the. Well the high load is the missing multiplexing. So when PERSON9 launches all the target languages, the same for the given the input stream the same ASR worker type is launched as many times as there is sort of the target languages. And thats putting stress on ORGANIZATION3, because they need to provide so many workers and their have these bugs in workers so that they keep failing. How difficult is it in the platform in the mediator, to, to like follow the path and avoid duplicating work. So the idea.",
            "Yeah. Actual infrastructure which will help us in managing with kind of ASR output multiplexing, at the moment unfortunately, it has to be done at client level. Then, for example, performing the request of transcription, and then delivering the output.",
            "To more workers.",
            "Fortunately, there is nothing in the protocol will help us problems solution.",
            "Yeah, so there is no.",
            "Take note and find better solution in the protocol after these events.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON9, if you could just. Quickly share the screen where you had the launch of ten workers at the same time like underneath of each other.",
            "Yes. Yes, I can, wait for a moment.",
            "Yeah, so the thing is that the mediator. I do not know if this EB client when it runs ten different pipelines. When it actually runs the requests to the mediator ten times, or whether the mediator receives a multi like a Multi Channel, or multi path request.",
            "Could you repeat this?",
            "So when PERSON9 will share the screen, hopefully. I'm still not seeing the screen.",
            "Yes, oh it doesnt work on this browser. I'm going to change the browser.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON9 will probably disconnect for a while, or another machine.",
            "I'm listening on other machine than.",
            "So the thing is. The thing is that the what I see in the log file from EB client is that these English ASR or English sound is being converted while a to, one of the target languages. And then another line, which says the same English sound, converted to another machine translation output and so on. So it is there is just ten lines like that. These ten lines are they produced one by one from EB client. Or is it that the EB clients connects and asks the mediator once. With all these then targets at once.",
            "As far as I know. To the mediator. Just one, then the nine different are feeded by mediator without sending. At this point, I'm not more sure and on neither of these information. Because in my opinion the mediator should, should somehow find an economic solution, also in the ASR route of the path, but is actually that it is not being a specially 90 here, and here.",
            "So if you if you open the screen, that PERSON9 has shared. And there you will see that in four lines, and these info lines are going from English lecture ORGANIZATION3 hybrid audio to English text to English published, and similarly for the for the other languages.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "So what I would like to see is that the beginning until English text would be actually done only once. And then in the mediator would either to send. It should have publishing or in English, or send it to the machine translation into Czech and so on. So we don't need any clever optimization of the path of we would need to only like combine the common prefix.",
            "I understand, but at the moment that it is not meant to work in this way. Unfortunately.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We will reason about this problem, because actually for the PROJECT1 project. We have also between communication protocols reason possibility to find a kind of when is performed. To find the kind of. Instead of list of workers. Maybe data structures. In order to use the if possible common route and dispatch that to the different branches, but the is something we have to reason carefully. Because actually the ORGANIZATION2 is not meant to work in.",
            "Um-hum, yeah, okay. So right now PERSON9 has tried to launch those and it failed, because there is not enough, ASR workers right?",
            "No I don't, there was the problem that it didnt receive any output. I killed it right here. But I want to show you that I updated the EB client this way. One. At least one input stream was not available. Then it. Then it terminated. But I just its return, and it is, and bug info, and it works sometimes.",
            "Yeah. So this is just making the EB.",
            "Yes thank you.",
            "More to of the workers.",
            "Yes, but and on this wide terminal we see how many, how many ASR workers are available at this moment, there are six, and I'm going to run it on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten on one 30 second audio.",
            "So it will not succeed says so, actually, well, it will succeed with the first seven ones. And now there are seven.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But for me. Its weid that. Now. There are no available ASR. And at this point there are three, so probably three ASR crashed from the seven and were released.",
            "Um-hum. So just any anyone know where PERSON12 is or why. I know that PERSON11 is giving the lecture, but has PERSON12 said anything useful during this morning.",
            "It doesnt matter.",
            "Yeah, so I'm afraid that we what we need to you is, because the machine translation workers seem working well, right. Yeah, we are failing to feed them with the input. So what i will try is to well, again, keep pinging ORGANIZATION3 for a for getting this running, and for like providing so many workers that the bugs wont be that severe for the whole system, but does anyone have any idea. What else could we do. And the only thing that comes to my mind would be. The multiplexing worker, or other actually the ultiplexing client. So the client that would get the CTM output from the worker, and then send this CTM to the different segmentation workers, more get the segmentation outputs already and send a text. So what is the status of the text input to the to the mediator. Is there text only pipeline available.",
            "Last time when we thinked about this what was the batch mode and we agreed that we.",
            "Dont want to develop this for the online mode.",
            "Yeah but I can try it. Because the problem is that when we see we send to whole text file at once. And we have to wait for the segmenter to process it but in this case not at once, so it could work. We need to try.",
            "Ok, so one thing thats possible. The remedy that is a possible remedy. Of the current situation is indeed a use this text communication, so that we would have modified the EB client. The EB client would ship the audios to the mediator and get the segment output from the segmenter mediator. And then it would send it to the different machine translation of systems as like another EB client would do. Right? And this would ORGANIZATION3 and we should not be facing the bug the bugs in their systems.",
            "Yes. I'm goint to test the ASR workers.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So it run one audio to six ASR workers at once, one, two, three, four, five, six. To all of them which were available. Now it finished, its still waiting for something. Yes, and. And it seems that, two of them, no four of them are received identical output to friend and two of them are different, but I think its because there is. Because the is dynamic. It, its still meaningful output, three and four, yes, so it works.",
            "So the summary is that if we are lucky and the workers work. And then we can get it running. And for he highest number that we saw it running with was six right?",
            "Yeah. At this point six German, oh six English.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can run four German. Is it, no its not. Oh nevermind.",
            "So what does it mean? It is not if it means that the in German workers did not start. They were available.",
            "No I didnt choose proper.",
            "Fingerprints, right.",
            "Yes. It doesnt work like this. I need to rewrite this script.",
            "So is there anyone who would be available for implementing the C code the EB client, modified to do the multiplexing internally. How is ORGANIZATION4 is always like that, those who have delivered their work in the best shape. Are those who are most free to do more useful work.",
            "I'm afraid that you have low availability because PERSON12 is going on holiday. So I don't think we can manage anything like that.",
            "Yeah, okay, so you have, you said PERSON12 is away. Or will be.",
            "Tommorow on Wednesday that I will be around for the event.",
            "Ok, so you will be around on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but not tommorow.",
            "No, I'll be around Thursday, Friday.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "And the, I'll be around in the evening stuff need to do on Wednesday.",
            "Yeah. Okay, yeah. Thank you. Okay, so we'll have to manage ourselves somehow. Okay, so thats the ASR workers in the Google document, and hopefully we'll hear something from ORGANIZATION3, then the empty workers I said that these good. The publisher that was some strange problem for while. And I see PERSON5 on the call now. So. Do you know what that was? PERSON5 was the publishers. I cannot hear you. If you can hear us. So I'm not sure if you wan this. Hello?",
            "Hi.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay actually no I still don't know where the workers. I'm trying to upload different. Yet another update, but its very slow. So pleased wait a bit. Sorry.",
            "Yeah, because PERSON9 said the publishers are working. Yeah, so.",
            "They are in admin web as idle. And available here.",
            "So PERSON5 what exactly was the problem that you mentioned?",
            "I have plenty errors in my log. And I mean, you what it does not. So.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to run six publishers yeah. They cant connect.",
            "Ok. So they are only register was the platform or the mediator, but they are not actually operation.",
            "Maybe the maybe this one English EU could be working. No.",
            "So what are you seeing in the subtitles now, because I don't see anything. I have the new, I have the new.",
            "It finished already. And it release, yes it released everything. No this is weird.",
            "I haven't seen any of the subtitles in my view of the presentation platform.",
            "Yes, and it received formally English and German. And so. I but there are still six available ASRs. This is weird.",
            "Yeah, okay. So PERSON5 we will still be around to fix this right.",
            "Yes, yes, I will.",
            "And could it be related to the new authentication that is in the presentation platform. I guess it should not be related to that. But yeah, I'm just.",
            "I'm almost certain it is not related to that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "From German.",
            "Yeah, okay. So there is. PERSON5 will still investigate. So the presentation platform. So the credentials are there, read only or well, user view should be PROJECT2 password 2019 admin view is the. So and then the of subtitles. My question is so that we can make little platform running locally within sol Wired Network. So thats something for PERSON13 probably because we need the presentation. So yeah.",
            "What exactly.",
            "So the participants notebooks will all be connected to the very same wired network, and we need the URL with RTMP protocol with the stream subtitles to work from for their notebooks. It means that the engine. Server has to run within network, but maybe not necessarily the whole presentation platform right. PERSON13 can you, can you comment, because PERSON13 you'll you'll be coming to the venues. You will be only arriving on Wednesday evening, right? PERSON13 are you there? Hello PERSON13, can you hear me?",
            "I can see connection alert.",
            "Yeah, PERSON13 is talking to the microphone, and not even I can hear them. So maybe we are having connection issues maybe.",
            "Yeah, because she's muted I dunno.",
            "She is talking right now, but I cannot hear. I can probably relate what she is saying. Oh, well, try with different microphone.",
            "Yeah. So this is this is in the Google document I'm curious what the setup should be so that we stream the, the slides. And so far, we have failed streaming the slides, both from my notebook and my desktop. My desktop is not behind a firewall. But it fails to stream it for some input and output error. And my notebook is behind a firewall, and it failed for unknown error, which is probably the firewall. So how do we do it. At, on ORGANIZATION1 premises, so that the slides are delivered.",
            "I can run the exact configuration I've been posting. I can run it on the local network. And I'm still trying to figure out what can, what can possibly interfere with that. Since I'm i guess on the event you are going to be, every machine is going to be connected to the same LAN, right? So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There is nothing that. So my guess is that the configuration will work. I still don, cannot see for sure what is preventing us now from testing it. But I can I the exact copy, and I can right now between my two machines. For instance, I am I am in the middle of pushing that the very same file in some additional instructions on cruise control.",
            "Mm-hmm, yeah.",
            "Right? As we speak. Yeah.",
            "So could we with this file that he will push with the instructions. We should be able to test it locally here, right? So that we take, just an access point, the router or actually a switch, and we connect the two machines to that thing with wires. And one of the machines. We need to run engines on. And the other machine, could like open. The ORGANIZATION2 presentation platform web page, and URL should be something local like RMTP Cologne / 192.168 and so on so. So what is it 168. the.",
            "192.168. and then the number of the LAN.",
            "And that should work, right?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So this is what you are using. You are using the in your tests, you are using the real ORGANIZATION2 presentation platform, and the subtitles are coming from the Internet while the stream is only copied locally.",
            "Only local. Yes.",
            "Yeah, so when we should test this, and to get the enging server running. Is that in part of your instructions. Or should we use.",
            "Yes I'm expanding this extra write file, so you can you can find it on GitHub.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
            "Few minutes more.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Yes, now but it is essentially the same thing that I've put in the a sample pr sub streaming some time ago, right? Because at the beggining.",
            "Yes of the its almost the same.",
            "Yeah, at the beggining I send.",
            "Sorry guys, can you hear me?",
            "Yes, yes, now it works.",
            "Oh, finally. Nice. I restarted the browser.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Sorry. Firs of all i have a service notes. Sorry, sorry. Me and PERSON14 will probably arrive at some point on Wednesday.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "Actually probably around the 16 or 17. I'm not sure right now. But we will join you in ORGANIZATION1.",
            "Yeah. If they don't kick us out.",
            "Okay.",
            "So by the way, can you send me your cellphone number? Or I can share mine, so here in the,",
            "Okay, I have a office number, but I can share with you the PERSON14 one.",
            "So I have PERSON14 one, this is mine cellphone number, i just pasted it to the chat.",
            "Okay.",
            "So that you save it and give me a ring. I have the contact for PERSON14 already.",
            "Okay, perfect. And regarding the presentation platform, except for the logging parts, the release also implementing the feature, which will allows us to have select these source stream. But for example, the Spanish coming from the German translation or English translation. However, on Friday. We have tested the solution several times, and we and the students. It is pretty been impossible to the debug problems in these environments.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes. Because in the same log also in during those tests having ten streams concurrent. Its really hard to understand which stream as problem and which is the problem. So actually the functionality is working but we strongly suggest to, select our preffered path at the beggining. And stream just the one we select and not perform all the possible translation and filter just the output of the presentation platform because otherwise it will be really difficult to understand what is going to happen. And this is important especially selec is important especially the selection of the English the spoken English. Because PERSON9 has shared with us the scheme of the microphones and so on. And if as far as we understood of course maybe I'm wrong, there will be three person speaking English the one in the round table, and the with corrects.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. It will be impossible at the moment to descriminate which English is coming from which microphone at present platform level. So we the strongly suggest to choose the preferred the English stream at the beginning. And the performer translation only of eternal tone of all the possible combinations.",
            "Yeah. So if I may repeat this, or comment on this. Its PERSON9 notebook which is capable of choosing the English sound. Among those three. They all come as different channels through the four channel input sound card, and it depends how PERSON9 launches. The EB client, what fed to the input to this EB client that determines the English channel. Its either one of the respeakers or the, the person from the round table. So I agree with you that, we do not want to have to use different English different versions of English for different target languages, but I think that it is possible. That we would want to have the English subtitles presented from the main round table, and the translations to go from the respeakers. And for this. PERSON9 can simply run the EB client twice, one of those who will have connect to the English presentation, using the round table sound. And the other one will use one of the respeakers. Fixed one and connected to all the target languages in the machine translation. And this is possible if I'm not mistaken. PERSON9 please. Have you followed can you confirm.",
            "Yes. I confirm.",
            "So it is totally out of control, and its so out of control for presentation platform the presentation platform will simply you display different. Presented languages. But it has no way to see which the English is which it will simply anyone who connects as little as a worker providing English will be displayed there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is the, thank you for the classification. But this is there is still one more topic related, and thats the that the delivering subtitles to interpreters booth, and, that is something which will need different English languages the like string, booth one booth two booth three. So is the platform is the current setup a ready for this. Or what is needed to add this.",
            "Yes, it should be ready. We have to prepare you know, the X1 configuration, X1 X2.",
            "Yes, um-hum.",
            "It should work. Maybe during this afternoon. We can start putting up the final setup. Actually we are pretty stable with, thanks to PERSON5 and PERSON9 for the work on Friday. We are going to check each path and i think that they already manage the directs ASR output for English, Czech and. Just the part is missing at the moment.",
            "What is missng sorry?",
            "Interpreters.",
            "Yeah, yeah, so. So if we are lucky with ORGANIZATION3 ASR workers, then like it seems to be running right. And if we are indeed lucky with the subtitles being streamed from the from the presentation notebook. So these are the critical things that need to be debugged during tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. ASR workers or the multiplexing worker, and the streaming off, stream of slides. From the presentation notebook into the into the like into the local network.",
            "Sorry i cant hear you, there is there is some noise. Yeah. I guess it was very who. No.",
            "I stongly suggest to perform as much as possible test today and tomorrow.",
            "Yes.",
            "Because on Wednesday.",
            "You'll be travelling.",
            "Yes, I will be travelling but also in LOCATION2 is holiday.",
            "Oh okay.",
            "Yes. So that I will provide you my support during my travel, of course having the when I will have the, when I'm not flying, and PERSON5 will not be there so actually we have two, arrive on Wednesday which if possible everything as much stable as possible.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I think thats everything that we could have discussed. So X1 till X4 should work, ORGANIZATION2 will add them this afternoon, critical things to fix today + tommorow as test streaming of slides and debug ASR workers and or create multiplexing and I'll call it client, because its actually a client for the mediator. Yeah, thats. One thing that I noticed when the subtitling was somewhat working was that there was a lot of repetition. And that feels that felt strange. So there was the same English sentence. Coming out repeatedly in the subtitles. And we have not debugged, this properly. But what could cause this.",
            "It be the partial hypothesis output. So then how does the. Yeah. That in principle, that could be the case for the user. The experience was very annoying, because it was like two different text messages interchanging, or a select appearing one after another in loop on in the subtitles field. And one of them was very long. And the other one was quite short of. So while was reading the long one it changed to the short one. And then to long, one again. And the two, these two messages were actually just the continuation of each other, and they like kept repeating. So it was even something like the, the transfer unit mismatch. So that, for example, the output ASR could be an updated hypothesis that your presentation platform would be popping into two parts and showing them one after another. And one after another again. That would this be possible? So you have, the word \"Carl limit?",
            "Lets say the worker who manage the publication on presentation platforms perform of organisation based on configurable parameters. In order to have subtitles of suitable lenght, and also to have to not too fest. This is probably the reason why you see uncomplete. Lets say sentences but partial hypothesis output has to be managed before the subtitle arrives to the publication worker.",
            "Yeah, so could this logic actually be actually remove from the or disabled, at the presentation platform, a so that the present will simply show, too long string if it arrives. You don't like the part, you just want to see the exactly what the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, the,",
            "I'm afraid that if there is like a logic implemented in two separate the components. Then these two logics may fight together will fight with each other. And the this. What I saw the this morning that seemed like that indeed. So that, the presentation platform was chopping the long string. But in my eyes. It would actually feed. Both of the of each of those segments from. By one by one by one were shorter than the line, so if the presentation platform was simply show me the two lines at the same time. Like one chopped a. Then I would have more time to read it. Then the update it would maybe come. So these two lines would be redrawn of by the presentation platform, because the ASR shipped an updated hypothesis. But even if the ability to hypothesis scroll debate, then I would not lose as much context. But as the two parts of this message were alternating. I was not able to read it at all.",
            "Okay. Yes, we can do it is the okay.",
            "So simply show, whatever you receive from the ASR output.",
            "Actually it could happen that you receive two long strings.",
            "Yes.",
            "Ok. If its not a problem for you. OK. We, can do it.",
            "I think I think this is something which the segmentation worker should take care off. Well. And already the empty should ignore that and just path the true. And the, you know, I think. This is done in one place.",
            "But the I will well. We will, of course, don't worry. I'm just reasoning. I think that probably the segmenter worker is preparing phrases for the machine translation. So that probably would succeed.",
            "Yeah, you are right, okay.",
            "Preparing longer phrases.",
            "Yeah. This is the.",
            "Its correct the idea to put the segmentation if only in one place into, and not into different places, this is correct.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So in the long term and now we still have the ORGANIZATION4 team on onboard, in the long term I think that we want to have machine translation as immediate as possible, translating incomplete sentences as well. So the segmentation worker. Should be delierig well again, we don't know where the logic should, but the segmentation worker should send the whole sentece well, should send segments, which start at the beginning of the sentence and they should gradually become longer and longer as more ASR output is ready. The risk is that there is no end of sentence in the original speech. And in that case, the subtitles. The translations wont fit into that into that small window. And in that case, I still think its beer if the segmentation worker is the one who would be forcefully cutting the sentences, rather than the presentation platform, because then the presentation platform is stuck with like I have shown only something, and I need to show something of the rest the later on. But in the meantime maybe a new message will come already. And then I do not know what to show like its the, Oh, where is the segmentation worker from the ASR does have access to the continuous stream, right?",
            "Actually, we can test it the solution without our.",
            "Yeah.",
            "We can test it this afternoon.",
            "Yes, yes so please disable it for now and test it during the afternoon.",
            "Exactly. So that we can decide it the solution we prefer.",
            "So there is one last thing to discuss. And I'm adding that to the next call that I would like to make would be actually tomorrow, and I don't know what time. So again, I will. Yeah, I will copy these availabilities of yours. Here, everyone please open the Google Document and fill your availability for tomorrow. Confirm your availability for debugging, be available on slack. So we may. We may not need to call with this phone call style. But we need that people are available on slack. So I'm not sure if PERSON12's, PERSON12 is away right. Yeah.",
            "I found another type of error right now. If you can see.",
            "Yes.",
            "Moments ago, we had eleven ASR workers, connected ten of them, and there are only one and 5 of them connected. And only one empty worker was busy. So this is very weird. It didnt say that it didnt connect so we should have this check and Dutch, Hungarian, Polish and so on. We should be unavailable but, they werent. And now again.",
            "And could it be some timing issues, so that like I assume that window on the right?",
            "On the admin web, it says that all not available at the moment.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just checking.",
            "Yes. Now there are only two but three have, one, two, three, four, five connected.",
            "Okay. Someone is freeing up.",
            "Yes, some of them freed. Yeah. They still didnt return anything. Okay, this would be better if PERSON12 join us right now.",
            "Yeah, so actually, he appeared on slack so that's.",
            "Yes, he restarted workers on my request. Now we have seven. Lets wait a bit.",
            "So I'm checking if he can connect.",
            "Okay, now we have. Lets test this segmenter. Yes, nine segmenters and ASRs are working according to this test. They returned. They returned this. But together with, with empty. Nothing. One two three four five six seven. Yes. I have connected one to nine, nine workers but only seven of them are taken here. Or no. There are two. So I.",
            "So could there be some delay with the information about the availability of two workers, so that when you run.",
            "It this is updated every two seconds. This is watch command.",
            "Yeah this is watch command, yes, yeah.",
            "If you know the parameter updated.",
            "Minus N.",
            "Yeah. And can we.",
            "1.5. Yeah.",
            "And 0.5.",
            "So twice a second we are getting an update but PERSON13, could there still an delay in the mediator in the admin interface?",
            "In the admin interface could be.",
            "So that he have not like up to date information about the availability of the workers.",
            "Sorry PERSON1.",
            "Well, PERSON9 is concerned about empty workers not being used, while the they should be. And I think this could be simply relic and outdated information in the admin interface. So that the empty workers appear to be available but they are already in use by the pipelines. So I'm checking whether there is delay.",
            "I think that probably the admin web is based on there could be a delay.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON9 should not rely on this, like the.",
            "Oh.",
            "The interface is simply slow so only when you run something for longer period of time then the numbers would be correct. So has PERSON11 joined? Yes, PERSON11 hello? PERSON11 are you here? Yeah so PERSON11 is entering his availability for tommorow. PERSON12 has not yet filled this in.",
            "PERSON11 says he has a problem connecting to the pexip.",
            "Yeah, but he is on he was there for a while. I saw him in the list of participants. Yeah. Okay, so. ¨.",
            "With the priority. And so on and we will set the English as the most reliable source. For output. Actually we are. When you will switch to German or to Czech, tell us because maybe you can see something which is not what you expect. So, okay.",
            "Sorry I didnt get the message, so you, the message was that your, you have English as the preferred source language.",
            "We are going to configure te presenation platform, English as the top priority source language since we are running test with English, but please if you change the test, tell us so that we can put German as top priority and so on, because otherwise we'll not be published i on the front end the subtitle.",
            "Oh so the subtitles will not be published at all even if there is no English available, right?",
            "Well, there is some kind of, fallback mechanism but its still pretty match manual, lets check things together.",
            "Yeah, okay. So we expect to be translating or well to be translating mainly from English indeed, so if we happen to use German or Czech as the source language we'll let you know. Yeah, okay.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON11 tried to connect the, but he failed. And I think that at this point there is nothing else to discuss, I would like to thank PERSON9 and everybody else who has been helping him a lot with the debugging and. I would also like to ask everybody to keep debugging this afternoon and tomorrow so that we have the workers reliable, and, yeah. PERSON12 is now, PERSON12 will be available tomorrow morning. PERSON11, can you hear us or not? PERSON11 is again among the participants list on the pexip call. Yeah. Okay, so thanks everybody and please keep trying full load because this is something that we have not suceeded at all, PERSON13 please let us know as soon as the or the segmentation within the subtitle presentation is gone so that we can see what it what it looks like. And if we are happy with the outputs when they are maybe too long, but directly from segmentation worker.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, yeah, so thanks a lot and we'll be in touch well during the afternoon and also tomorrow during the times that you have inicated, possibly making another pexip call but its not planned far now yet.",
            "Okay, perfect. Bye.",
            "Thank you, PERSON11? Oh PERSON11 made it? PERSON11 hello, you made it? Yeah okay, so sorry if someone is still. So PERSON11 are coming to LOCATION1?",
            "No, I will not be able to make it to LOCATION1. We have other possibilities I can.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Too bad, And are you. And are you and PERSON12 available for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, like possibly all of the time because right now we have as you were not at the call, but you have observed during the mornin that the critical point now is all the workers, its the combination of the non multiplexing in the mediator, and the unreliability of the workers that puts extreme like demand on the number of ASR workers that are available, and we need you to swiftly restarting them. Would you be available for this, for all the coming days?",
            "I understand, and. I want to be there as much as possible and to restart the workers as possible, but i can not guarantee that here at every minute.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "There will be spontaneous other meetings we have responsibilities that we have to also do.",
            "Yeah, soI've asked PERSON12 in the slack today, maybe you can not see the message, but my idea was that maybe you could setup very simple CGI script or PHP script or whatever, so that we could ping fixed URL and tell it the session ID of a worker, ASR worker which is not functioning. And what you would do, in the script would be you would know which process ID this ses. This ID corresponds to and you would kill the process and start a new process instead, so that we could initiate the restart of the worker. Would this be possible?",
            "I begin to do that. I don't how I can make some kind of website available for you over the internet I don't know map our workers to session IDs, the workers know about the session ID, I guess they do but it might have this.",
            "When they start, yeah exactly. When they start they emmit the session ID when they get it from the from the mediator, so all you would need to do would be to grab the logs for the given session ID and the workers would need to save their process ID when they are put processing the log. Or the log file could already have the process ID in the file name or something like that. And to create a webpage that would be accesible for us, its it depends on your setup but in principle you could also run a very small webserver such as Python or Parallel. That was the thing, and that has to run on the machine where the workers are, so that like it can kill them and the firewalls must not be in the way, but if we set it up or if you set it up on high port then you hopefully to get the request from us. I think this would be very useful and could be just the few lines of code.",
            "Maybe but those would be some difficult for types of code. I have no experience in coding in any web server package, I'm looking at the logs right now and I don't see easily from the logs where were the session ID, no I don't think we can do this.",
            "Yeah. So the only thing is that we. We keep telling you like wrist. But how do you know which workers are dead then.",
            "We restore them all.",
            "Oh, you restart them all the time.",
            "I mean, for the empty workers easy.",
            "No the ASR workers are the problem.",
            "Has to go and like control C and start new.",
            "So that is very well fragile, because you can accidently kill things which are okay. And also its very slow.",
            "But its, I don't think the process can be easily automated. Especially not because we don't really know what to.",
            "Well, I understand it is difficult to, to debug it, like to fix the workers so that they don't get stuck. But I think it should be easy to wrap them in something, so that you forgot to launch it you will modify the launching script so that the launching script will emmit its process ID. So the log files, the word. Can you share the screen with that? Can you on pexip, can you show us how you restart the workers?",
            "We have a workers which all produce log files, we have here are actually docker container ID is and we can look this is what one of the log files looks like. It has all the, everything this worker but they are no session IDs. So.",
            "Can you maybe show the log back? So th. I think you must have switched the screen because there were some details in the yes.",
            "No, this is correct. This is this is the worker running on this server right now and the docker so that we can kill. Segmenter and the empty workers but its.",
            "So there is no ASR workers in this list or are they.",
            "The amount of effort it takes to change something about these, because you also. Be aware that this system is not just used in the detail, we also have. Which is more automated system but uses complete different techniques from that, and comp. It will be a lot more. So we have the system that works okay this way, I would prefer to find the workers not resetting this so much more, for the PROJECT1. We have this program also, regularly its starting and stopping sessions, several times a day. 5 days a week. Because its - We get maybe one worker getting every week, so.",
            "And here we get it all the time.",
            "Workers and hour here. So something is different. With the way is using the system, which is causing this problem to be more severe. And I don't have the ASR workers running in an screen session right now, normally we don't have ten of them. It will be also be possible to have a script to make restarting one faster but mapping them to session IDs and making the script available online is a lot, just simply can not.",
            "Okay, so I understand that creating this remote killing will be difficult. But if you could at least make sure that you can restart them with just one command and not like moving to some screen, and so on, and then looking up which command. And then three commands to run the worker. It should be one command to. So. How do you. I would like to see, how do you tell a dead worker from a working worker, because I really do not like the idea of you restarting all of them. When we say a we are one of them that we need one.",
            "So thats. Probably don't have one right now, because usually the ASR workers are. Logs. So right now at the end, it says waiting for client. So this one is idle.",
            "Or maybe stalled. Could it also be one of the stalled ones, one of those that don't respond?",
            "Well, in theory not.",
            "I can test the worker right now.",
            "But.",
            "Can you, PERSON11. PERSON11 can you tell minus F instead of this less. We would like to see what is appearing in the log file.",
            "Yeah, but if something appears there we wont see it. In less.",
            "Gets this.",
            "Yes, I am going to test all of ASR and segmenters yes.",
            "Its back to.",
            "Yes.",
            "So that the thing is, in theory this log output will indicate if this worker is in fact idle and is in fact new connection. At the log output. Which should be.",
            "And can you show us the beggining of this log, so again less of this file but it stopped.",
            "This is the segmentation worker, so its using.",
            "So PERSON13 would know if the session ID, PERSON13.",
            "Tell me.",
            "In the protocol. When there is this connected to server mediator, its like one third of the of the page. And before the first message waiting for the client. Is there. The point is that the point in the code. Where the worker knows its session ID.",
            "I don't know I have to check.",
            "Yeah. So. So PERSON11, if you could look at the code of this. Because I assume that you can compile it. I know that you have not developed it yourself probably will see on.",
            "I have not tried recompiling. Like I said.",
            "Yeah, they are gone.",
            "It probably works, if I can avoid it I will not.",
            "Yeah, well. So I think it is the matter of a would be only to recompile this worker with one print.",
            "Yes.",
            "To know the session ID. So Improposing that the log files would contain one more line. And that would say: \"I've got this session ID from the ORGANIZATION2 mediator. And then the log file already contains the docker ID in its file name. So then, I'm not like totally asking for, for this web interface killing but asking for speed up for you, so that we would tell you please restart worker for this session ID and. You would just grab the log files for the session ID. And you would immediately know, which container to restart.",
            "I will have to discuss this.",
            "So obviously we need. We need you like solve it properly. It should not get stuck. But for the, in the meantime, it will save a lot of nurse for and it will speed up. It will speed up the restarts.",
            "PERSON1, sorry. The session ID these. Written in each pocket, receipt mediator. Yes.",
            "So.",
            "The XML which is the data XML, there is stream ID, which I actually don't know what it is. But then the session ID which is together for example stop. There is also session ID which could be exactly the session ID we are talking about.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON11. For you I remember that there were some issues with the move from the old mediator version to the new mediator version. And the problem was exactly this Xml that you were lying on some custom XML library, and you had to switch these libraries. And so on so.",
            "This was only about our presentation platform.",
            "Okay.",
            "They use the provided library. So its actually not, so PERSON13. Its not the XML that they are accesing, because they use precompiled library. So they need a function call that would extract the session ID from.",
            "When you have the cloud packet, it will have the get session ID function. Will provide you the session ID.",
            "So. So PERSON11 if you could do tried this afternoon, finding the source code of your workers.",
            "Actually can you try right now? I able to access.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I'm also more complicated with the workers because they are running. We cannot run 20 ASR and 20 segmenters and so on. They are actually running on different services.",
            "Yes.",
            "Can you try if you can chat.",
            "Yeah, put it in the chat yes please.",
            "Can you see whether you can ping this adress.",
            "I'll try. Yes, I'm succesfully pinging it. And. Also and map it, so SSH are open port there. So 22 4443 and 4444 are opened there. So I guess that if you, So there is definitely way in which we could if you launch anything simple on your side then we should be able to reach it.",
            "Its fine I just need to know.",
            "So that this is what you have already open, you have open SSH port on the on that machine, I'll share my screen. So this is this is the net map of your. You see that? This is the open port on that machine. So if you launch one more simple thing there, that we could get in touch with, then it should work, and I'm now I look up simple.",
            "Listen. Yeah, so if you see my screen now. On the right hand side this is the client, I'm typing something. And it appears on the netcut which was listening to this port. So are you on that machine the on that. Are you on this machine now PERSON11?",
            "Yes.",
            "So can you run can you run this? Can you run this?",
            "Its running.",
            "Its running, okay. So I'll disconnect from here and I'll try. Okay it didnt get through.",
            "I would be very surprised if you did university firewall that. I'm actually surprised so.",
            "Well, if you tell me your password. I'll just try to see if it works. Yes, so I could be able. Okay, its not getting through.",
            "Thirty. You are getting through.",
            "I could be. So.",
            "Might be getting your SSH access. And but restarting the other workers. But that will also load the other two servers. At least one of which I think is not accessible.",
            "Yeah. So. But anyway, I think still having the session ID in the log would be very useful for you so that you could restart it right away. And I like you would see a message in the slak window, restart session ID and you would just run your own script restart session ID, and it would do the grapping and it would do the killing and it would do the restarting, so it would be one copy paste from slack to your screen and that would save us a lot of worries.",
            "Yes.",
            "So that you would paste its adress here.",
            "Yep, yep, yep.",
            "Sorry it is not correct.",
            "Sorry, which, so the number should be different or.",
            "I13.",
            "I cant hear you well.",
            "52 instead of 53.",
            "Okay. So this one is hidden.",
            "Yes, I am a.",
            "So its actually failed to resolve. Both are failed to resolve so they, even the name the host name is not available. Like its not published.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. So I'll have to run now, but please prepare, please modify worker so that they show session ID and so that you have a simple script which would be something like restart by session ID.sh and we will send you session ID and yu would only do this, and it would do the right thing, and if you accidentaly run this on the wrong machine, which does not have this sesion ID the worker for the session ID it will tell you: \"Well, I do not have that worker, you need to run me on the other machine.\"",
            "Will see.",
            "Yeah, okay. So thanks everybody I dunno of you want to stay on the call, or but please whoever can please keep debugging with PERSON9 and speak to you or at least talk, write to you on slack tomorrow.",
            "Okay. We will keep testing everything.",
            "Okay, thank you. Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "I hope that everybody's fine with recording this meeting, yes. Yes.",
            "Ok, thank you.",
            "And I see, that it is indeed being recording so being recorded, so, that's good.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "I'll try to share my screen, because I was given the presentation options, so probably you see my screen now? I'll.",
            "Yes, we do.",
            "At least I do.",
            "Okay, and, yeah and there is this, I'll minimize this, so there is a small agenda for the call today.",
            "Unfortunately, there is no overlap between ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION2 in this week, so I'll try to do the poll for the next week as well and hopefully, we will find something there.",
            "If no, then we'll, I'll just transfer whatever is whatever is needed.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so for today, we have this small call and the news is, are there any news from ORGANIZATION4 about the status?",
            "Because you have the official contact points and I'm not sure whether you have received any response from them whatsoever.",
            "I am not sure either but I hope, that there will be a resistent answer soon. I was tasked to prepare the exact questions we are asking so I hope that's on track, but PERSON1: I'm not sure.",
            "Yeah, so that it's already like two weeks since you have contacted them, at least.",
            "So hopefully they will be able to respond in some reasonable time.",
            "The second question is: can we go on and, like split the budget, that we previously allocated for ORGANIZATION4, among other parties?",
            "This is the our internal ORGANIZATION4 decision, and I know, that you are like not the \"this is a very decisive person\", but still, do you think do sense, that within ORGANIZATION4, the idea is, that you don't want to get any money from this project?",
            "Is that correct?",
            "Yes, that's actually correct, we don't want any money.",
            "I, that could be considered official already.",
            "Yeah, okay, so we will we will proceed and will modify the budget without you.",
            "But at the same time we will allocate person months to you.",
            "Or like you should allocate those in the ORGANIZATION8 and I will somehow make it clear in the tables, that the person months that are by ORGANIZATION4 will not be paid for from the budget, but you will be assumed to have your own funding for those person months.",
            "So I don't know, how this is going to be checked by the commission afterwards, but just promise some sensible number of person months, that you could indeed claim, that you have worked on project, and definitely, it should tasks you want to do within the scope, of the project, so just like broadcasters further within ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So then the, the speech to speech translation is something that ORGANIZATION6 doesn't want to have in the, like they don't want to ship translated audio to the partners parties in the, remote conference calls.",
            "I don't think that this is a big problem.",
            "I think that we'll just make sure that in the project, there is no promise on this, and with ORGANIZATION2, this makes the situation easier, because you would only make sure that the platform produces subtitles and sends them to ORGANIZATION6.",
            "For the real use case, like not remote, but, the physical world use case, we are still probably undecided how are we going to ship the translations to the participants, but my baseline idea is some web page that gets updated, so that would be again speech to text translation, and, I don't know, PERSON1, whether you have experience with shipping voice to individual cell phones or, how should we approach this for the for the conference or the workshops at ORGANIZATION4 events.",
            "No, we don't have experience.",
            "We always provided subtitles, basically.",
            "Yes.",
            "We have to identify, in fact, how the final platform for the delivery of the of the translation, I think, but the, text to speech doesn't add so much information to the text, in fact, and probably -",
            "That actually -",
            "Please.",
            "Yeah, I just wanted to confirm that I also think that it actually makes the information harder to digest.",
            "Yes, because it's it doesn't provide any prozaic information, so that's the.",
            "The text to speech doesn't provide any information more than that.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah, thank you.",
            "So, we will board in the project as you specified or you, within the integration work package should, like make sure the description is clear, and ORGANIZATION4 should be aware of this, like for their workshops.",
            "That ORGANIZATION4 should somehow make sure that participants have some devices at hand, that can display the subtitles in some form.",
            "Because each of the idea is, that each of the participants will be seeing the translations in his own language.",
            "So the ORGANIZATION2 integration should translate from the single speech signal that comes in to a into the many target languages, and ship those subtitles to the different users at the workshop.",
            "Yes, that's correct.",
            "Just a question, because maybe it was not clear to me.",
            "The application to provide the subtitle would be ORGANIZATION6 application, correct?",
            "That's for the remote meetings, but I don't think that this is the case for the live meetings the ORGANIZATION4 the ORGANIZATION9 congress, so there is the plenary session of the ORGANIZATION9 congress and then, there is the individual meetings, like the workshops.",
            "And, in the plenary session, there is the single speech given by the speaker, and then possibly some questions, and we'll try to connect to the interpretors and transcribe their voices, and or directly the main one and then, this will be shipping the subtitles to somewhere.",
            "And this somewhere, in a very baseline solution, can be just the web page with, like autorefresh and. Unknown _ voice: Yeah.",
            "And, yea.",
            "Sorry, it wasn't clear to me, so I will also asking the integration work package for the let me say presentation application development.",
            "Yes, yes for live meetings? Yes, yes.",
            "So, the idea is that you, in this project, you are the integrator for all the technologies, and you are also the final application provider for their live use case.",
            "Because ORGANIZATION6 will not be involved in the live meetings.",
            "And I think, that the ORGANIZATION6 should be in, like present at the at the conference at the ORGANIZATION9 congress for dissemination purposes, because there will be also the meetings done remotely among the ORGANIZATION4 delivery SAI institute.",
            "And for the remote meetings, they will use the ORGANIZATION6 platform, and then the subtitles are delivered through ORGANIZATION2 into the ORGANIZATION6 platform. Okay, that's that's fine.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So this was this was this was also for PERSON2, just to make to make that, to like, known in within ORGANIZATION4 that.",
            "And maybe, ORGANIZATION4 should contribute to that integration task some person-month on like, agreeing on the interface.",
            "You mean for the ORGANIZATION9 congress?",
            "Yes, and for the workshop, for the live events.",
            "Yeah, that's, for me, it's a part of the congress.",
            "Yea, of course, this has to be.",
            "Yea, so simply, PERSON1 will create a task in the work package 7 in the integration, and this task should have some like many more person month by ORGANIZATION2, because they need to develop this.",
            "But also, there should be some small amounts of person month by ORGANIZATION4 to, like make sure that ORGANIZATION4 is aware of what the platform needs and how to, like make sure that the participants can use it. Unknown _ speaker:",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Yea.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you, so now let's move to the next, item in the agenda, and there's the task and the task and deliverables related to the ORGANIZATION9 congress, and other ORGANIZATION4 events, and this is something, that would like to just clarify how I see it, and make sure that you see it similarly.",
            "So there will be the main ORGANIZATION9 congress, in the middle of the project, and then, before that, there could be some dry runs workshops, or there will be some, we will make sure that there are some.",
            "And after that, there will be also other events again, this workshop style events mainly.",
            "So when I say workshop style, I mean: it's a live meeting of up to twenty people, and each of them strives to speak OTHER4, but they are non-native speakers and there is the subtitling running, and that subtitling translates this non-native OTHER4 into all the participants languages, so that they can follow the discussion with, like more input and better confidence.",
            "I hope that everybody sees it the same way?",
            "So, ORGANIZATION4 should make sure that there is that there is enough events happening and that we know about them, and that we like, connect to them.",
            "Aside of the main ORGANIZATION9 congress.",
            "And ORGANIZATION2 should be ready to.",
            "Well, I don't know, maybe you should have like.",
            "You definitely have person month and travel plans in the budget for the main congress, but maybe you should add some extra for the other events.",
            "The dry run and also the follow-up ones.",
            "Yes the we have the non-apriori the number of events, that would be manageable.",
            "I think but at least one event per project a year should be very important.",
            "Also, for the view for the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Review meetings.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So, I think, that in the first year, we should have at least one dry-run workshop, which is like actually a complete test, but it's still before the main ORGANIZATION9 congress.",
            "In the second year, there definitely should be the main congress, and then maybe one more in the same second year, or like two in the third year.",
            "So I would ask ORGANIZATION4, if it seems reasonable to have one dry-run, one main congress and then two follow up workshops.",
            "Could you check, if this is if this is feasible, or if we have to go for just one dry run main conference and then one follow-up?",
            "Well, it is, I believe it s not decided yet.",
            "We have only a vague idea that, of course, something will be happening the year after the congress, but what and how many is not decided yet.",
            "But also, you reminded me an important thing: I need to also ask about the way the follow up thing will work.",
            "Because there is the clear distinction now between your plenary and the workshops.",
            "And from yo your speech, I get the idea, that you are interested mainly in the workshop-type thing.",
            "Yes, that's because it's like it's more in line with the speech research partners want to focus on, that's non-native speech.",
            "And, it like reduces the further burden of the source languages, so it's maybe the more important setting.",
            "The congress with the plenary sessions is something too to show off, but the workshops are, like more practical, I would say.",
            "So, that's the that's why I kind of promote them now.",
            "A bit more.",
            "Yes, it makes sense, but I need to ask.",
            "I have no idea what forum the other events will be in.",
            "Yeah, I've understood that from what I've heard from your colleagues, I've understood, that it's mainly these workshop-style sessions that the congress is with plenary sessions is something, not that frequent.",
            "So, I think that, PERSON1, for now, I think, we're quite on the safe side to say that will have one dry run, one main and then two follow-up experiments.",
            "So if you can plan four events in total, one of them being the longer one, that will probably be easy to accomplish.",
            "I was about to answer the anchor point you put into the ORGANIZATION7 doc.",
            "I wouldn't create I wouldn't like not to create separate task, but to have a one single task ORGANIZATION4 events.",
            "Okay.",
            "And one believable prior.",
            "Okay, yea.",
            "So, so the then this task should be planned for the all the three years, like, maybe starting at month 7, because nothing could happen earlier, but running until the end without any specific dates, right?",
            "Exactly.",
            "Okay, so let's make this one task for ORGANIZATION4 events, and then, in the task description, we will say, that we plan to have the dry run and then the main and then the two follow ups.",
            "Yeah, so that's clear.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, okay thank you.",
            "And then, related thing is the view, like where the events should be mentioned, and I've put it into that into the agenda here.",
            "So the integration work package is the one that makes sure that everything runs.",
            "That actually delivers the software and the tool to that to those events.",
            "While the work package 7 dissemination helps to promote the project and its results at these events.",
            "So this is like, collocated activity and the dissemination is something, that should include ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Whereas the integration for the events does not need ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Because the ORGANIZATION6 is not providing anything any remote platform into these events.",
            "Is that clear?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yea, okay.",
            "Yeah, so now let's move on to the next item, which is the OTHER2.",
            "So I understand that the ORGANIZATION2 would like OTHER2.",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm not sure how the word extend is like covered in OTHER2.",
            "Well, we don't have ORGANIZATION5 on the call.",
            "But they already have some OTHER2.",
            "So, I don't know, how much person-months do we have to devote to OTHER2 to, to move it to level where ORGANIZATION2 would like it.",
            "And at the same time, we need to justify this additional resources for OTHER2.",
            "From like the overall project's use case.",
            "So maybe, PERSON1 if you could say more about like what the level of OTHER2, how much effort is needed there, or and then ORGANIZATION4 will comment on, like, the availability of the need of that, or maybe, we can squeeze some of this need from ORGANIZATION6, possibly.",
            "I'm just guessing.",
            "So if yea.",
            "Okay, just let me add one thing to this.",
            "And also ORGANIZATION2 is active in the ASR field and provide ASR for not only for OTHER2 language but for thirty language, currently.",
            "So OTHER2 -",
            "So OTHER2, obviously, being our mother tongue language, is that the one where we perform better.",
            "And we already specialize the OTHER2 ASR the for many, domains, so called domains.",
            "Currently one of our customer is the constitutional court and depending on the availability of the data, the person-months required the for training and dedicated the OTHER2 model, for the OTHER2 ASR model let me say, can vary from three to six month person months for maximum.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, it's not a huge task and we can we have perform the tests also on the on a at the OTHER2 parliament.",
            "We have been competing for the OTHER2 parliament, and we reach the accuracy up to ninety eight percent of accuracy.",
            "That.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is considered the most accurate OTHER2 speech recognition system, so it's.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "That's, that's very good and I think, that the that needs to be like advertised for in the project proposal as well, and that extends your role from being just the integrator to also working directly on the ASR work package, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so please make sure that your person months are already are also included in ASR work package and in the description, the ASR work package is not yet populated very much.",
            "So ORGANIZATION5 role is even a little slower than we are with the writing.",
            "So this like very good, you can easily propose your own person months there in the work packages and then they will see that you want to be a body or in touch with them anyway, probably.",
            "So a just let's let's make that clear in the proposal, and OTHER2 is not one of the big languages of ORGANIZATION4, but it's still one of the official languages, so it's totally acceptable to have that in.",
            "And since we have the OTHER2 partner and the best ASR system for OTHER2 in, it's, it would be a pity not to use it i would say.",
            "Okay thank you.",
            "So we probably do not need any specific need from ORGANIZATION4 on this, but still, maybe ask around and or mention, that in the project, there is this partner, who has the best OTHER2 recognition in the world, so that there is the chance to use it.",
            "PERSON2, right?",
            "I guess i can ask around, but I'll probably get the official reply again that it would be unfair to prioritize any non primary language over the other.",
            "But what to do is probably for you to decide to talk about it in this way anyway.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "So, yea, I see.",
            "So ORGANIZATION4, yeah.",
            "So simplified well.",
            "Okay.",
            "So now the next item is the this table on the re-speaker data.",
            "So if we can open that, that's part of the, budget, that's the third sheet on the budget.",
            "And this is something where we need to like.",
            "This is for us, this is for our ORGANIZATION4, and estimate, how many person months should we allocate in the data collection work package and, this is already doing detailed accounting on how many hours per speaker do we need for to be able to adapt to the speaker.",
            "And in which languages do we plan this and so on.",
            "So, and also.",
            "So, one purpose is to adapt to the speaker and second purpose is to have this person as the re-speaker at one of the live events.",
            "So as you see on online 17 and below, there is what i entered for our ORGANIZATION4's but this is a very raw guess, and i don't know, PERSON4 is here, but maybe ORGANIZATION2 also knows.",
            "How many hours per speaker do we need to be able to adapt to them?",
            "So my understanding is that for each re-speaker or interpreter that we want to reliably recognise, we will ask them to sit a certain number of hours and read aloud some written text.",
            "And record this.",
            "Is that the way this is done?",
            "Or is it done differently, the speaker adaptation? Speaker adaptation is done essentially how you described, usually. 23: 29. The number of hours depends on the ASR system. Because the ability to record the forty hours of speech is.",
            "That's a lot of work. Yes, yes.",
            "I know it's I know it's I know it's a lot of work, so I don't know how much should we say that we need per speaker. Let me say whether usually, we collect fewer data in order to maximise both the effort needed and the result. But we really ask, let me say a maximum of a one hour. But I'll repeat, it depends on the ASR engine. And also obviously the more the data the most effect that the adaptation has. So it's always.",
            "And then, for OTHER4, we, as ORGANIZATION3 would have like to get hold of two of them and each of them this re-speakers could be, may be asked to do more, maybe up to five hours per re-speaker.",
            "And then, for the presence of these re-speakers, at the conference, that actually needs to estimate the full duration of the event.",
            "So three full days of dry run, and five for main conference.",
            "Now i heard, that the main conferences is four days, right?",
            "PERSON2, is the main conference four days?",
            "From the top of my head i don't know.",
            "I think it's i think it's four days.",
            "So this is here is a formula that it doesn't really work.",
            "Here's a formula that I'll edit it, can I edit it?",
            "That estimates at now like seventy hours that need to be covered and this is obviously no longer like uninterrupted speech.",
            "So this hours per speaker should be also like the total hours, so we need the speaker for.",
            "So if there is like some training phase or whatever, that should be included in this, so that's why when PERSON1 said that you ask the person to speak for one hour, it's it would be probably good to put here like two hours and if I say four, then I actually expect than I don't get more than three hours of the recording or something like that.",
            "So, I would like now everyone.",
            "You just to.",
            "Because I was being about the numbers.",
            "The adaptation starts from an already existing acoustic model for the language.",
            "So all of the -",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's mandatory -",
            "So -",
            "To have a OTHER1 and the OTHER4 an acoustic model to start with the adaptation.",
            "Yeah, yea.",
            "So, i assume that the adaptation model for, so, well, actually, when the when the recording happens, you need just the person and a proper device to record the voice.",
            "But, then to actually make use of these data, you do have to have the model.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I have, I assume, that for OTHER4.",
            "I have lost you on.",
            "Believing, okay?",
            "Or what did you say?",
            "I have lost the your sentence, I have lost.",
            "Yeah, yea.",
            "So, i was just saying, that for the recording, you have only the person and the device, and then, for the usage of this recording for the actual model adaptation, you need to have the baseline acoustic model and I assume, that for OTHER4, this will be given to or provided to the project by ORGANIZATION5 or ORGANIZATION1, or possibly even ORGANIZATION2. We will try to create our own, but we are still starting with this, so i don't expect that we'll be able to have like the best perform models ourselves.",
            "And for OTHER1, of I'm in touch with the OTHER1 radio and they should be able to provide us with like a considerable number of hours.",
            "I'm like getting the numbers right now and put them into proposal a to create the baseline acoustic model.",
            "So, there will be more person-months necessary to process this, and like clean and train the acoustic model on that, but we should not need any recordings for the baseline acoustic model for OTHER1.",
            "Hopefully, the data is already out there somewhere.",
            "Okay and most important for the also for the adaptation, is to also have the transcription of these which -",
            "Yes, yes so, that's what the OTHER1 radio also has, an there has there was a project here, that also did this transcribing of OTHER1 recordings, so there is some transcribe data for OTHER1.",
            "My, my final suggest in regarding the adaptation is to be able to collect real re-speaking sessions in order to also be able to model not only the voice, but also the way it is.",
            "The speech during a real life session.",
            "Because you know, reading without the pressure of the event is different than on the event.",
            "Yeah, i see.",
            "Yeah, so let's that's a very good idea i will make sure that we have this like, it actually fits nicely in the in the hours here in this table, so we could have like one more purpose and that would be, like recording or adapting at re-spoken events, so that could be part of this these conferences already.",
            "Or it could be a separate thing.",
            "I think this is, that in the proposal, that we should write that this will happen at the dry-run, but we may want to have like more such re-speaking sessions as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah - thank you.",
            "So for OTHER2 and for the other languages, can you please populate this table as i said this is for us, so the idea is, that we will like this table, the upper parts in on this sheet do the add ups so this, the blue one adds the hours by the different languages that we want to record, and the red sub-table summarises these person-months by a partner.",
            "So then, each of you once like, you have indicated, that on that type of language and the type of a speaker, we'll see how many person months it creates and this number should be accounted for in the in the data work package. Okay.",
            "So we can obviously process also OTHER4 speaking a re-speakers like giving short term contracts to them and to and do the recording here in LOCATION1, so if, for example, ORGANIZATION1 would suggest, that they want to have some OTHER4 re-speakers like at hand, then just make sure that you, like create this line here and say that it is to be included in our budget, because, like we should be paying those people, but it is for the purposes that ORGANIZATION1 wants to do something specific.",
            "If that would be the case.",
            "But this has to be filled by each partner.",
            "All the teams, who. Add the needs for OTHER3.",
            "Yes, so all that, this should be filled by all the teams, that want to get, like direct access to data for speaker adaptation, and I would leave this to up to the ORGANIZATION5 to decide, how much time do they want to invest into speaker adaptation for OTHER3.",
            "The project will so, so, yeah, it's it's it's like, very uncertain at the moment, but we hope to get hold of the actual interpreters, who will be interpreting at the sa ORGANIZATION9 congress, and it would be great get these for the adaptations sessions.",
            "And these would be speaking OTHER3, French, a as well, so, maybe our create here like all these, for each of these languages some ORGANIZATION3-handled re-speakers and hope that we will get these people and record those.",
            "But if ORGANIZATION5 or your would like to have more data for your particle language of interest, then enter this here.",
            "Well, as i said this is only for us to see how much how many person months do we have to have in work package 1 on the data.",
            "And this is, this is what we'll add there.",
            "So, then, these person month here do not make it directly to the to the spreadsheet here, to the efforts.",
            "They should get to hear only through the Overleaf involvement in the data collection task.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yea, Yea.",
            "So, is there's one more thing, and that would be the other direct the other direct costs.",
            "So for the equipment: yeah, it's i don't know, how to how to go about this, but PERSON1, you previously said, that you were just fine for the conference interpreting that you already ran, for the for the insurance company.",
            "You are just fine with the audio equipment that was there.",
            "Let me say, that i've started checking the availability of specific hardware, especially for the re-speakers.",
            "Because, you know, if we have re-speakers, they have to be, they have to use a specific headset in order to be sure.",
            "But the audio signal is the better for us.",
            "Okay.",
            "Some for, for the equipment, I think, that we will also need some of those devices for the re-speaker adaptation.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So if you can make like a separate line for one ORGANIZATION5, of for recording and I'll copy that for ourselves then.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "So this should, we will have a next call a without ORGANIZATION2 but with others on Thursday, so if you could do this before Thursday with some rough numbers, that would probably be good, well the time is running up.",
            "It's we have like fourteen days to finish the proposal and that's that's very little.",
            "Okay, so the last bit is the missing text parts, and here, i think that it's probably more efficient, if we just say goodbye and everybody will spend the remaining fifteen minutes in writing and writing and writing.",
            "Or do you have any other ideas how to make sure that we - create a good proposal?",
            "Is there anything remain to discuss?",
            "I think it's important, also for the integration part, the other parties needs to integrate because all of the parties will need to integrate, also participate in the drafting the text. Putting, just putting ideas i can elaborate on an ideas to improve the integration. But so from my side.",
            "Yeah, so there's one thing actually that I want to wanted to comment on.",
            "Thanks, already, you created the tasks in the integration work package, but primal titles only, and it was not clear to me what is the integration with publishing platform, so the publishing platform is for the minutes, that's like the, or wha that's task 6.4.",
            "I'll try to open that here, if I.",
            "Task 6.4 was the one what was not so clear to me and yo we already thought about that before and if.",
            "I see. The imple, the development of the plot of the publishing platform of the.",
            "Yea, I see, okay. For live meeting yet.",
            "Yeah, so as of now, the tasks I like it's hard for me to locate it, but the task integration still, I should, maybe not here, where's the Overleaf, Overleaf, Overleaf, yeah.",
            "So, task 6.1 is the integration of ASR essential from multiple partners into the ORGANIZATION2's platform, and that's, so everybody is involved in there, which is expect to be expected.",
            "The integration of multi target empty engine should definitely include us and ORGANIZATION1, i guess.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, PERSON4, make sure that you are there as well.",
            "I'm talking about this, if you can see my screen then I'm talking about task 6.2.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then, we have this automatic minuting, there will be more involvement from us and from al from ORGANIZATION6.",
            "I'm not sure about so this is record regarding the other e-mail, the work package leadership.",
            "I don't know how much you want to delve into minuting yourself or how much causes you want to delve into minuting.",
            "So depending on that.",
            "We can discuss on properly on the other.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Or maybe exclusively ORGANIZATION2, right?",
            "Yeah, maybe I will, I would like to also add that ORGANIZATION4 of all of the design and testing purposes because that would be something.",
            "Yeah, good one, exactly, yeah, so ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION2 should be here.",
            "At the ORGANIZATION9 congress, this is actually something, which was fairly named today, but it should be at all the ORGANIZATION4 events and these should include everyone, because everyone will be a, like at like everyone should be available for the ORGANIZATION9 congress, and also for the other for the other events.",
            "So, that, the involvements in terms of first months will vary, but everybody should be there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, the deliverables.",
            "I think that will probably promise reports only.",
            "Or systems?",
            "I don't know, yeah, maybe, maybe PERSON4 could comment on there design of deliverables, because that's what like in the spoken language translation, and maybe we could mimic this layout in, in the integration work package 2.",
            "Yeah, so what can I say here.",
            "In project, we had similar we had similar division that we had to prototype to the actual systems.",
            "That we packed into the deliverables and we had some reports that we wrote. PERSON4, the thing we pay attention here is that there is a kind of a so not all is the deliverable ones and we had to find a prototype a couple of months before the end of the project to allow the integration of it as well.",
            "Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure like whether all the prototypes should be deliverables, we just promised to deliver systems that be ready for starting the integration thing, that was mentioned some months, six was mentioned somewhere, but maybe that shouldn't be a deliverable for the prototypes, so I don't know all and other work.",
            "That's a milestone.",
            "That's a milestone.",
            "A milestone, okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So milestones are, I've heard that milestones are something, that you just tick off in the system where's for each deliverable, even if it's software, there has to be like a cover letter, cover report, is that true?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it is, yea.",
            "So deliverable is a typical pdf, and copied.",
            "Yea, exactly.",
            "Well, we did a few prototypes.",
            "In fact, those were small reports, to be said well, this is a prototype, just how you install it, this is the number of languages covered here's what it stands for.",
            "Promo.",
            "The prototype, like I prepared a few amateurs and stuff like that.",
            "So it ended up being report.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Let's, so I suggest, that to do the same thing.",
            "Is the question, the hard question is the timing.",
            "So, maybe, PERSON1, if you could suggest something for a for your for your work package?",
            "Like by when should be what version available, and then we will check it.",
            "In the timing of the deliverables should be somewhat in line with the timing of the work packages.",
            "And this the work package that we have just talked about is spoken OTHER4 translation and that's that's 3, work package 3, so recourse tasks all run throughout the whole project.",
            "So the organisation is then, kind of taken over by the individual prototypes and the releases.",
            "I would slightly prefer to have some, like progress visible also in the tasks, and that's what I do for my multilingual mission translation.",
            "So this is like the current tentative plan that will first focus on multi-target and then multi-source and then flexible multi-source and whatever.",
            "And there g will be deliverables related to those, and I like the idea of having a few months between the software and the report and the integration, so, for the ASR, sorry, for the integration work package, work package number 6, there is also this like compact block of, of tasks.",
            "All tasks running through all the project duration.",
            "And I would like to see this somehow, somehow graded.",
            "So the for example the minuting integration is definitely something that can start only like in the middle of the project.",
            "So I'll. Is it okay if I write it in a doc, a word document?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "It's much faster for me to wor.",
            "Yes, totally okay.",
            "Totally okay, I prefer ORGANIZATION7 doc, if you don't mind, so, well I don't have Microsoft Word at all, so if you send me a Word doc, I will upload it to ORGANIZATION7 doc anyway to just open it, actually.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, if you start a ORGANIZATION7 doc, separate one then I'll, I'm happy to do the merging of the text into the Overleaf.",
            "Okay, that's fine.",
            "ORGANIZATION7 doc is fine for me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so I think that's that's it for now, let's indeed close the call, unless there's any other questions?",
            "No more questions from my side.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So thanks very much everybody for joining today and, PERSON4, we'll talk again on Thursday, and otherwise we keep exchanging e-mails and, hopefully, the text will like get created quickly, yeah.",
            "Thanks.",
            "Thanks.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye.",

            "I see.",
            "Okay, so, yeah, So PERSON5, PERSON5 is there as well or not?",
            "Yeah, the picture.",
            "Yeah, hi.",
            "Okay so let's start. What we have in a document. So maybe we can start with PERSON6 and PERSON5 and about their the topics.",
            "I've been working it could be done it seems like PERSON8 came out of paper.",
            "I'm sorry, I can't understand you much because, yeah, this -",
            "Okay, try to closer -",
            "And so, what is it I look at the my papers and the -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And was the manning paper people transports and you seen to do barely well and -",
            "Yeah, you mean to have it and manning, yeah?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah. I still not hear very good, but, yeah - Yeah, it is very, yeah, yeah, this is very nice paper. I read them, it, and yeah - So we would like to do it is similar things are. So maybe we agreed that you will you will do some probing on transformer networks. So that's alright. OK so - And you should you can try to probe on PROJECT5, or OTHER8 or these of GPT tool, or I do not know - It you have been working with the OTHER8, yeah?",
            "Okay.So, so, okay. So the question is on what you would probe. Which features. And -",
            "We use one in the paper. We should probably - If you really go down and probe you should probably use more than this ORGANIZATION1. I think.",
            "Sorry, I cannot hear you.",
            "Okay, so, we used the ORGANIZATION1 in that paper. And we did it use anything yet.",
            "Yeah, you ORGANIZATION1, yeah, yeah and - Okay, but, that you can use the ORGANIZATION1 and you can use SL the word the read the context word and manning. I mean the individual positions.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As well.",
            "Yeah, and another we did, we was barely admitted what we did but in a paper. So we could differently do more stuff, we could do the tactogrammar, the OTHER10, you, as you said. Another one was especially would you like OTHER10, can doing like rows and stuff. There was, this paper called, I give it to OTHER3 open sense to me, yellow paper. What they do attention and compution scores would interesting in the sense that in their 60 internet use try to use sentences and test on harder, weirder like constructions to see introduction like for like still means that would some basic characteristic. And, I think we used to be interesting and with if would be attention is in product placed -",
            "Sorry, I, now I haven't understand you at all.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe. Yeah. You can, can you hear me? You can hear me, yeah?",
            "I can hear you.",
            "Okay, so that problem is that -",
            "Okay, okay, I speak bit louder. So what the paper does is that they have distinct where they take attention between subject and verb, subjects and verbs and subjects and verb in sentences. And they check how much it makes a difference if there is some simply intervening and now I'm fraze.",
            "And it seems like the attention actually still manages to find still manages to find the proper subjects for the nouns particular the about higher layers. Now it through doing OTHER10s but kind of stuff might also be because they use like it's a confusion score the PSI too.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "With a proper.",
            "Yeah, yeah, it would be possible, yeah. So. Okay so, okay so, you can start with I don't know, if you can start with PROJECT5.",
            "And maybe, yeah, you can focus on OTHER10 or I dunno. How we are matter with PDT with the tactogrammatical? You haven't attended a course in here.",
            "No, I mean like automatic dependencies and the stuff I don't know of the freement.",
            "Yeah, because yeah, because we have ee we have the tactogrammatical treebanks annotated on OTHER9 and OTHER7 as well. So maybe you can try OTHER9, is OTHER4 is OTHER4 and there are the manner annotation, and these annotations are - You can, for example, you can try to probe for the for the for means, which are really like more semantic dependence relations like ac for example actor. Which is real actor and this was not as subject what is real actor that mean that in passive sentences it's it's the object. The actor and other of but the actor, patient and these like or higher semantic labels.",
            "Do you speak what news functors?",
            "Sorry, I can't understand, I don't understand you.",
            "For means do you mean functors?",
            "Yeah, I mean functors not for means. Yeah, okay. So maybe you can you can start with that. So try to use PROJECT5 and use for example, single perceptor on to - Actually, what have you used in the paper with we need? I mean, on top of the on top of the transformer you used a perceptor or -",
            "Is it a one layer one layer what we need, it's basicly like more than one.",
            "Okay, so you can start with something like this. I think and you can you can see what result it you have.",
            "I mean like prepare to better practise just do that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And what was this collaboration that you guys were talking about with the people in LOCATION3?",
            "Yeah, we saw we haven't we have connected, we want to we want to have a skype call that we need. And maybe it's you, because you collaborate we need. Because we want to come to LOCATION1 for I don't two weeks and collaborate on something with us. So it will be managed to you to know what we need will do here and so that you can contribute or I don't know. But we haven't so far we haven't organized this call so we've do first create organized call here with the leader here of this group. And then - Okay, I will let you know and then we will see.",
            "Alright.",
            "Okay, so maybe we can shift to proceed to PERSON6.",
            "PERSON1. Okay. What I did was looking in to a transformer attention matrices because previously and computive for ee sentence from your call.",
            "For use for black box.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah and I checked there is a measure, which measure is out the attention matrice is a line with particulations and actually I got this from other paper. And it's ee chunked down from much attention is focused of the first of words data in ee syntactic laytion. And We've to look what are the patterns of the what difference actually our results from though measure for PERSON10 proposed one from different photo like one observation was that for the, let's say easier find the determiners or multifiers. The lower layer zero lenght layer was quite good and for one subject -",
            "On the on the zero on the first layer the there are the attention looks on the previous on the next token so that's that's the determiners on the other.",
            "There are some variances in that. But then it was quite good but say like the subject finding sub object there's few one like one head that was specialized looking for that particulation, let's say. It's most in fact ultimate layer like there's like it's layer. And it's also one head that's very surprised look that penny sour for relations done for determiner is the multifiers it's subjects or objects and looks in the last layer. Then look up what is the layers how was attention matrices is that looks like for other sentences. I think in mostly, yeah, it's said like for the first layer is like many just low close positional in some cases which some variations like very focused in the principe like bounce.",
            "So I have better send the last the last couple of the seconds. Sorry.",
            "So I thought those attention has the particular different parts for syntactic corelations. And for those the determiners modifiers those heads look like justs looking up the neighborhood but context the words just shift that one of it's one to way to find determiners and something some clients is in that variations that's look plus one, minus one, just with any fix pattern. And the higher layer for components depend subjects was what was it was balustrade layer which have this rows was looking in to different chunks. And. What's this items and like I think it's I think it's the relations let's say that can be drive from attention matrice some of correlate with syntactic tree. But it's shouldn't be any head look an cannot find, by any specific corelation, what we are looking, so it's it's says like -",
            "You are training about its raise or the dependency trees or?",
            "Dependency trees, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's constructure which some heads correlates that some heads has connection that's correlate with relation in different laytions in syntactic tree but it also had like this different types relations adverb. And she has the -",
            "Have you visualised, sorry, have you visualise which phrases or which balustrades are there because it seems that there are almost all possible and these if you take the shorter phrases or shorter balustrades there are also almost all possible balustrades somewhere, or at least according my observations. So I don't know how you -",
            "You mean like the shorter phrases can be in like balustrades but like different balustrades in different heads?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. Actually I only focuse on those heads that's for instance was quite good at finding subjects the verb. There is one higher balustrades there. But actually it was only heads balustrades difference than have mix from cognition and balustrades. So, so, I only look at this balustrades heads.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It seems that the different heads do different stuff. What we need in our paper because we just use all of the heads. But - Yeah, it seems they do different stuffs so it makes sense to try to seek which head those what try to hide them supportly, I guess.",
            "Experiments are done on our on our parametres on our training. So it is on ORGANIZATION3 translation, yeah. Okay. I should say one thing we tried to have the similar results here in a use not nevermind then use PROJECT2 system and try to generate somethink like balustrades and we have many problems many problems with generating something similar, like similar to balustrades. Then we realise that we have to switch to some it was it was the option. So, so, I want to say that it's not easy to that there maybe different settings and little bit difference settings of transformer that generates completely different results. Very from the balustrades the matrices, the attention mattrices are very blurt and there were no balustrades straight and we have to it was like, the option. It was like normalization token, we even know what PERSON2 mean in transformer. I don't know where you PERSON4. Are you there, PERSON4?",
            "I think he got away.",
            "Aha, he went away. Okay. So we don't know. So, yeah. We start good quite long to generate something like balustrade. So I only want to say that there are many, many things that made many, many parametres that may chains and the chains and there is completely different, completely different attention it's an attention ways so, so, yeah. But if I we get it and we have balustrades as well. That's why we. The other papers don't don't report that there are some like balustrades maybe they have different parametres a little bit, yeah. Maybe completely different that. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Something becomes look at all heads, they just pick from patterns, they if I plan the person the head. But I think common factor in paper some heads are a bit specialized in finding one high correlations. Because one head stamps finds the subject for verb.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's gonna work for free paper.",
            "Okay. And what's your what's your plan? So, how long how long are you in LOCATION2? You are until December?",
            "Until half of December. The 15th December.",
            "Okay, so, we can meet each other personally because I will I will be taken in the beginning in December. Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, what are your plans? Would you like to switch to another? Another network like PROJECT5, or would you?",
            "Actually, I wanted to try extract the graph structures compare how was like similar syntactic trees or different types of trees we can extract from syntax. One aproach I think it can be checked for conclusions use the structure with a with a graph conclusion layers. The syntax relations can improve, machine translations for instance.",
            "You mean, you mean, you mean to take the gold trees?",
            "There is, yeah, there is the papers where they took syntactic trees so from syntactic parser and use that to form the input of machine translation systems so you would just use and put using graph conclusion. And they reported some improvements over using charts RNM which. So the idea was that we could try to replicate this and to compare it with the extract from the attentions.",
            "Yeah, okay, and we should also, PERSON5, PERSON5 send me the paper where they had two heads which are trained differently. With the objective function to be as similar as possible to the to the dependency trees if I if I redisconnect it. PERSON5, is that right? So they have two synt two heads or that were trained to be similar to a that attentions in these heads, attention to the syntactic, syntactic precedence or syntactic. And by this training they also, they also report better results improvement in they in they target these two heads like gold syntax. And they, yeah, they train it together so they don't need they don't need the syntax annotation when translating so it's it's learnt. Because it's an objective function. That it's part of they added to the objective function. They added that two heads must be similar to the gold trees. So the trees are needed only in training and in the there. And it is also very interesting. So you can you can try to read it and yeah - It's simmilar - Okay, so - I don't know what, do you have any other ideas, so?",
            "I will I will send you the links to the tactogrammatic when you can when you can download the treebank and the other link you need and other anything you need to start experimenting, and, yeah.",
            "So the paper working about.",
            "Or, I can add you to our doctor Who and share.",
            "Sorry, what did what did you said, PERSON6?",
            "That I can add PERSON5 to our OTHER2 group.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly, definitely, add him, and yeah. Okay. So, if you have anything else, yeah, we can quit this call and see you in next 14 days and I will be in contact with PERSON5, too. Is there anything. Okay.",
            "Officialy have a master thesis already or research for master thesis.",
            "I mean I would like to master thesis.",
            "Yeah, of course, this is, this will be your master thesis topic, of course, of course, So, yeah.",
            "Okay. Okay, so, see you in 14 days. Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "See you. I wanted to ask PERSON4 about PROJECT5 secure.",
            "Did he contact you or he didn't contact you or we don't know?",
            "No.",
            "Okay, so, So, actually, I think, yeah, we - Okay, so, so what you that there are you working on, PERSON5, cause it seems you two are basicly working on similar stuff -",
            "Yeah, it seems like that.",
            "We should we should at least know what each other is doing.",
            "So, I mean, I'll try the experiment tactogrammer and OTHER10s and -",
            "And so you were reworking on the manual hewit paper?",
            "No, I this but experiment.",
            "And right prophans cause I think this gonna be trying to get more reliable.",
            "So get the semantic score.",
            "Yeah, actually.",
            "Not chicks. And so with the money paper you guess that best trained or -",
            "And be sure main paper soon better so it s all better then see it. I just want dimension.",
            "Cause I know you read the paper as well I don't think need to talk about this one. Yeah. Is this final review.",
            "You basic write your e-mail.",
            "There is one more creation.",
            "And this is more to. Yeah, I know.",
            "Okay, there. Okay. Keybord.",
            "What's happening? Let's try this. Okay. So we will get invitation e-mail to join.",
            "So here we excellnet. And to analyse you to have your own call there's a poor based.",
            "Yeah, we have to.",
            "Experiment on project, because people who don't have acces to the.",
            "Yeah, they don't have word.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I asked them like mostly common base are we don t here.",
            "Put PERSON3 in seminar.",
            "Oh, this, yeah. laugh.",
            "Between.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Just know we still recording.",
            "Oh, yeah, that's fun.",
            "And still the waiting if PERSON4 reappears.",
            "It's a - Yeah, that the what happen there, maybe it's a connection problem. Contact us in argue. Yeah, I don't actually know where it comes from. That it was it from disables strange monkey anything what were used.",
            "Like the -",
            "Transformer.",
            "Yeah, that's trained in neuromantee, trained by PERSON4.",
            "There is this thing, okay, so now we're analysing is one of those retrained and test iniciate may be -",
            "It's model.",
            "It's a - It's a evaluate makes more sense to analyse PROJECT5 or maybe, I don't know.",
            "When attention bit more seem like nowhere compare and we have multilingual PROJECT5 than based multiligual PROJECT5 and PROJECT4. PROJECT4 wolud better answer in syntactic questions and recognize more than I have.",
            "Okay.",
            "But there was the paper it would become diversial one in PROJECT4. But that seem to like in multilingual context into record most detected function.",
            "And as we tried to mapping simple?",
            "It was this - It actually PROJECT4 kind a.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "And it's anybody published anything like that more syntactic I get in.",
            "I don't know.",
            "I guess our assumption is that we have probably the attentions are what task. Yeah, is it interesting that. Something that we do understand.",
            "Discusion bit, okay is PROJECT5 using my today. Yeah, we should looking at probably something more abstract the attention then the abstract.",
            "Anything so using my machine translation so use okay.",
            "And this was PROJECT5 stuff.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Is the question and the answer. So, so, you and I and someone else can be language model so PROJECT5 language model or you can be a model payed person possibly task and then he could think okay, so, for doing machine translation it be into syntax or maybe it's useless the syntax. I don't know what we should expect. Transformer trained for machine translation would be more syntactic and PROJECT5 less syntactic. Well, we can - But models get different result but it's hard to say okay. It didn't maybe prove because it's different. I don't know if it make sense to try to compare it. Right, yeah, what I thinking it's okay, should be really continue analysing the transformers that we have or should we someone.",
            "It's also so interpel between different model, shall pad that's completely different model.",
            "The yellow paper was like the some reason the small PROJECT5 model mention predict somenthing. Passwords. The lower.",
            "I don't know what exact from small PROJECT5 model. Base the model and large one. Large one didn't but it's just layer just and predict in tact. And then the small and then the base one. Which is the.",
            "What I look in to small, right, what we have, or I have the player capture most any syntax crash. Two heads let's say be chunked. And that's like.",
            "And so do you know the large PROJECT5 if it's just large data or it's model?",
            "Even model.",
            "Yeah, so model layer do we have. Yeah, we tried this with the transformers we think models and. As are assumption okay, something like syntax we have it's layers it's to have layers model analyse small layers so easier to find that. If it's too small than there is nothing interesting going on. Okay. I think make something who model.",
            "Very find is expecting just research.",
            "That's all, the training model it's just most train some and the stuff like that. Okay, what's analyse and completely different models and stuff and then looking something crash. These always maybe could differently. Okay. And so here anything alphe or?",
            "Yeah, we use some models in metro.",
            "I don't know is PCP use to.",
            "It seems to be working on picture form.",
            "Aha.",
            "The excel knows as best document basicly there.",
            "Yeah. Do you want something guys? There's nothing going on there.",
            "Event to my or.",
            "I don't know. I added I uderstand now that PERSON2 book invite her. Okay.",
            "So, I don't know I don't know these comming in December while I'm staying where is.",
            "I don't know.",
            "But he said he will be in the beginning December, so - You know -",
            "I think he was planning to come back like before I will supposed to I was supposed to be 8th of December. And I think that he was planning to stay here after that but then deserving like maybe going back for another 2 weeks after New year's.",
            "Okay, so. The make sense try to set up some more frequent with PERSON2 like model one on one.",
            "Okay, yeah. And analyse that.",
            "And analyse that, yeah. In some e-mail. Definitely PERSON2 seems to know what you might better. It s person that it's right. And he deserving in beginning December basicly as well. Nearly. That's end.",
            "Is this your master thesis? You're ready?",
            "Well, I mean, I analyse to some many.",
            "And there is possible thesis May again.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is a already.",
            "Okay.",
            "I can always submit it lenght tomorrow. Yeah, there is not - Okay. I don't know the deadline is delay just possible date so the video. Like anytime you have it ready.",
            "Well, you should have it, you know.",
            "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It seem to officially I have to PERSON2 adds in. Actually I think there is no like little bit like - We can PERSON2 send today and then tomorrow as well. It's not recommended way, but - There should be like at least one month.",
            "Because the dean has to.",
            "Okay. So let me the person inside.",
            "We will supply it.",
            "I should have some experiments.",
            "It make sense that you know better. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I guess, that's for the meeting. We together can then continue. I don't know if PERSON6 need to discuss something?",
            "No.",
            "Rewriting this paper with PERSON4."

            "Aha.",
            "So - But the family members went ahead with the marriage. And what happened is the next day the groom died. I'mmediately after the day of the marriage the groom died and -",
            "Ooh.",
            "There was further event and like, almost three hundred people got infected in one single event from there.",
            "Ooh, yes.",
            "And it exploded like anything.",
            "Oh, it's terrible.",
            "It's terrbile, right.",
            "Oh.",
            "And even the family members did not report of authorities and that the did the last rights.",
            "Are they afraid of panics or what they -",
            "Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
            "Aha.",
            "So if their family member dies, they are already in the in panic. Why do not they report?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Oh, it's terrible.",
            "It's terrible.",
            "It's terrible.",
            "Anyway - I think we all are here. So PERSON12, will would PERSON9 -",
            "Yeah, PERSON9 is here, PERSON9 is here. Yeah, hi PERSON9.",
            "Hallo PERSON9, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, how are you?",
            "Wonderful, thank you. How are you?",
            "Thank you. Hi everyone.",
            "Are you healthy?",
            "Yes, thank you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How about you?",
            "At the moment yeah.",
            "Okay that's good.",
            "I feel good.",
            "Yeah that's good.",
            "Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're here. And actually we spoke about the data set yesterday and probably it would be nice if we speak about consents today. If PERSON9 if you have something to say, maybe we could bega begin from that.",
            "Yes. Well, there are few matters I wanted to say. One of them is that we have two different meetings, two kinds of different meetings.",
            "We have English meetings and Czech meetings.",
            "My idea was to, run named entity recognition model on the English meetings. Find the proper nouns the names that we want to change, and then we replace them in both English and Czech meetings. I'm not sure if this works, I wanted to ask you if what you think about it. That are the names kind of common in Czech and English meetings and this approach will work or not? I want to know your opinion and also I run named entity recognition on English meetings. And I have a few parts but they need kind, they are not very structured. Because 'cause there meetings, and there are mistakes for the model to -",
            "Mistakes for what?",
            "Identify the proper noun. Mistakes in the in the model.",
            "Aha, aha okay.",
            "To identify the proper nouns. I will show you the file. First of all let's talk about the first problem.",
            "Yes. I think it should be possible at least for the common nouns, fo the common names that are repeating from English meetings to Czech ones. Because these names are used by Czech people. They are kind of pronounced the same. So it should be transferable. There no not - But they are not repeating and not all of them are repeating. So if we identify, if we, would if we use a name entity recognition model for English meetings, we will get the names for the Czech part of MSD meetings and for PROJECT1 meetings. But we will not get them for ITR meetings. These are only Czech ones and these are very qualitative meetings that is very good to use. So because they have very structured meetings and good minutes and all different people and different topics. So, so. This is all.",
            "So maybe we need to use another named entity recognition model for Czech.",
            "Why not?",
            "I don't know if there are any good models for that.",
            "Yes. We have good models for named entity recognition. I think.",
            "Okay.",
            "So we had at our institute we developed quite good named entity recognition models. And probably we should ask PERSON3 about that.",
            "Yes. For English models I use LNTJ, model which I guess is a good model.",
            "And let me show you this file that I get. I'll share my screen.",
            "Can you see this?",
            "Yes. Now I can. I see name.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so this is what the model extracted, but -",
            "So it's like, let me say, we had seventy nine meetings at all.",
            "That had manual transcript.",
            "With the document that you sent me. Tables on excel file. So we had seventy nine meetings and these are the words that it extracted from them. And this is the same thing each meeting. It's the name of meeting and all of the names. But you can see that it change just -",
            "Yes.",
            "It has some problems in here for example.",
            "Yes.",
            "So we maybe need manual annotation kind of thing. So we can for example, an annotator should -",
            "To remove these words.",
            "Yes.",
            "This can't be proper nouns. I can do, I can do it myself, but if there're annotators they can do it as well.",
            "Yes, I can tell the annontators to -",
            "Yes, and something else - The total number of names is this menu two thousand and one or two hundred.",
            "They are really a lot of.",
            "Yes. But - But I guess we can just we can just remove some of them automatically.",
            "Okay, my system is not responding. Yes, okay - Something is that in the meetings as you can see here, the name of the speeker is defind here. I guess we have to remove all of them.",
            "Remove. Remove, but in this in this case we will we have no diarizations or division into speakers. Maybe just - So these in brackets, are the name of the speaker, may not always the names of the speaker, but markers of speakers, and they show diarization. They show that they may be important for summarization too.",
            "Yes, but should we remove them for his part for the data set that you want to publish?",
            "Couldn't they be cho changed to A and B for example? Just change for something, so -",
            "Yes that will work too.",
            "So much better would be, get to some kind of agreement what we put like this, to these brackets. Maybe to make other type of brackets.",
            "I actually see that some of them are just -",
            "Unrecognized. Unrecognized. But still it is recognized that the speaker is has changed.",
            "Still this is not a zero information.",
            "Even if we, these markers special marks it means that the speaker changed. But we don't know what is his name because we can't recognize the voice.",
            "This is very important, otherwise you can't read the transcript when you don't see, that there is already another person. So it's really changes a lot.",
            "In order to -",
            "Yeah. So it will be good.",
            "So at the beginning of the line if we have brackets and something inside of brackets -",
            "It should be unified somehow, to keep the information that the speakers changed. Keep the information if the name of the speaker is the same. But name somehow.",
            "Yes, we have to remai rename the to A, B, C and -",
            "Yes.",
            "And like that. Okay, and I am not sure, should the letters correspond with the names that we are going to replace with real names for example -",
            "Yes. This is a question. But maybe not inside the transcript. It would be too complicated.",
            "Yes.",
            "Here in brackets you have MI for example or KA and inside the transcript we will have Karen. We will have, I don't know, Kevin.",
            "Yes.",
            "And will not KA. So I don't I'm not sure it's possible.",
            "Yeah, if you want to do that, we have to create a map that maps these letters -",
            "To the real names.",
            "Yes, yes, it's very hard because the transcripts are done by different annotators and the different abbreviations.",
            "Oh, yes.",
            "The only thing that could be re, possibly kept is PERSON3, because as you had you own experience everybody here, he is talking about eighty percent of the meeting. So PERSON3 - When acti when being at the meeting he is extremely active so, we can give him a mark. So he is mostly marked as PERSON3 or PERSON3. And maybe we can correspond PERSON3 and PERSON3 to PERSON3 within the transcript. But otherwise I would not do that.",
            "Yes. So I guess -",
            "Give him A just, give him A.",
            "Okay. What about the others? Should I change them or we are to discuss it more?",
            "Oh. Oh. Oh, I well, I don't know.",
            "PERSON3 isn't coming today?",
            "What?",
            "Isn't PERSON3 coming today?",
            "Today no. We can, I can ask him. I will write him now.",
            "Yes, if you ask if you it will be good.",
            "I think I will call him now. If he takes it and if he can, he can join us.",
            "Okay. And something else is that some words you can see that they end with this I don't know what you call it.",
            "Yes, this it means -",
            "Dash.",
            "The word didn't, the word didn't, wasn't ended.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Up to the end. So it could be the beginning of somewhere in. And then the person began to say it and didn't finish.",
            "Yes, it's exactly that in the meetings.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "I just wanna make s.",
            "Pardon, sorry, sorry. Just a moment. PERSON3 ja jenom jsem ti chtela rict, kdybys nahodou mohl, jestli by ses k nam nepripojil na ten meeting. Jo, resime proste resime s PERSON9 a s nasima, s PERSON20 a tak dal, jak budeme anonymizovat meetingy. Proste jestli dame diarizaci proste zkratku nezkratku, proste co dame kam. Tak jestli jako kdybys nahodou mohl, jestli by ses pripojil. Je to je to na zoomu, a uz jsem te pocitala, tak ti poslu na mail odkaz hned. Jo, dekuju, dekuju. Cau. PERSON9?",
            "Yes.",
            "So PERSON3 told that he will join us.",
            "I will just send him e-mail with, the link to the meeting. 00: 00.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Actually I will forward what I have sent you in a moment. PERSON3, I have sent him the invitation. Sorry for interrupting you.",
            "No problem.",
            "So are you still sharing your screen? Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "I can see that. Yeah.",
            "I want to add something else.",
            "I have the same oh same idea about the words that end with dash, but I just wanted to make sure that -",
            "Yes.",
            "There is not possible that any proper noun end with dash. Am I right?",
            "Any proper noun?",
            "Yes, I can I don't think that would happen.",
            "Uf, why not when you have PERSON17 here stop fifty five. As you see, there PERSON17 it's very possible that this PERSON17 and he is, the person who was attending the meeting.",
            "Okay, that is -",
            "It's not excluded. Definitely it is not excluded. Yes -",
            "Is it PERSON17?",
            "Yes, this is the person.",
            "Okay, so let us -",
            "And also there are a lot of cases that annotators should not really understand the name. And, well, it's not excluded.",
            "And it could be also a mistake. So this line five, four, zero, one, this chain. I'm not sure that this dash is okay here. But annonator could think that it this was an unfinished word. And that's why he put a dash there. So another possibility is a mistake in dashes.",
            "Yes?",
            "Yes, yes. From PERSON17. Yes, this is the case.",
            "So what should we do in these cases? Can we just remove the words with dash?",
            "Remove from the transcript?",
            "Or maybe just remove them from our proper nouns.",
            "Oh, let me think. So actually if the word didn't finish.It means that it appeals no information.",
            "Yes.",
            "In this case, it could be just removed from you is usually -",
            "But -",
            "I'm not sure - So from the point of view of GDPR I could suppose if the word is not finished, it is not the name. It's half name. So it should not anonymized.",
            "But this is just my just my very unsure - So I have to -",
            "I understand.",
            "PERSON3.",
            "Hi. I'm here too am here too. I stop my video just the reduce the band width again, but I'm also already listening. I see that you are struggling with the grey cases for named entities. So -",
            "Yes.",
            "I, agree with PERSON12 that technically we're probably good with like ignoring this. At the same time, I think that all the named entities have to be located automatically. And that has still there we have to prefer recall over precision. And that the precision should come from manual validation of that. And the manual validation should be done at the level of word types. So like in the list that I saw previously. We will immediately be able to say that all these words or most of these words, RAM is not that one. But transcript is not that one, drink is not that one. But, PERSON11 is probably name, then ORGANIZATION2 is already something that we want to replace. PERSON6 is surely a name that we want to replace. So od on word type I'm already like doing a fair bit of annotation. And that means that all occurrences of this should be, like, hidden censored. And then for the partial words. I think that we should go well, token by token. So ideally this list, which be complemented with the context and then when you have the context, you can decide better. So it's, we can little bit improve the way we're collecting this list so that we also know the surrounding three, four words on each side. For example, this PERSON14 point, full stop. Because that is surely that just one occurence. And in this one occurrence. Yes, Polak is named entity named entity that should be replaced. So I would not go for any decision like all the dashes are word boundaries. All the dashes are no word boundaries, I would I wouldn't go into, this word type decision. Because it is no longer reliable. I would go for word, token, decision for these cases.",
            "Yes. I just what I had in mind was two step manual identification.",
            "Yeah?",
            "What I had in mind was that at first we use with two thousand and something.",
            "Yes.",
            "And first we remove some words from this one, for example, we can be sure that.",
            "Yes, exactly we're sure that is not a proper noun, yes.",
            "Yes, so we can remove them and then the words that are kind of gray boxes we can we can just indicate them in the meetings and then let the annotators -",
            "Yes.",
            "To choose if they are need to be removed or -",
            "Yes, I fully agree with this two step manual annotation. I defnitely like it and I actually kind of propose that as well. So you I'm happy that you arrived at the same thing independently. And I would just do one little difference. So here in this place. There are also things where you know, they are person names. So there was the thing that I was talking about. So PERSON7, PERSON1, PERSON16, PERSON18. All these are clear names.",
            "And these can be also processed automatically. So manually we select them from this list. PERSON13, that's also clearly a name. And when whenever we, so any occurences of PERSON13 can be replaced in the data with the special token. This is named entity ID this one. So we will have like hide the ID. Maybe you can hash it. So that's the, that's a safe way, so that if you use Mt five sum and then first five, characters of that, or something like that. Then, you will have ID which doesn't allow you to reconstruct the name entity. But it allows you to, to like arrive at the same ID immediately when you have the entity value. And so I would label all these clear names in the data. As this is, here was a named entity, which has been labeled as such at the type level, at the word type level. And like it is already confirmed. So there is no need to look at the instance, anymore, and we will keep all the information that we have. So if we do, we could also do the other thing for like, the RNNs. The thing that are clearly not named entities.",
            "Or deliverable. And for these, you would say in the data automatically would do that replacement. And in the data it would say: this word was suspected to be a named entity but it was decided it's not one at the type level.",
            "Yes. Yes, that's what I had in mind.",
            "Yeah. Perfect. So that's I fully agree. And then that will also allow you to resolve all these cases like PERSON4 full stop.",
            "Yeah. So, for this two step should the annotators do that or I should mys I should do that myself.",
            "Sorry your voice is disrupted?",
            "Should I do that or we should assign it to annotators?",
            "Well, give it to the annotators, because they are they have read, ideally to one of those who has worked with these with these transcripts for these meetings. Because they would immediately recognize some of the names as names, and they would also know what are not names.",
            "So one of the annotators would go through with this quickly. And remember, they have to say, for each line, one of three options. This is clearly a name. This is clearly not a name and cannot be unnamed. There is no need to anonymize. And the third one is it depends or I don't know.",
            "Yeah but annotators should have something like interface. They will not do it in -",
            "No, not at all.",
            "But how?",
            "They can do - Here they will just add A, B, C to this line.",
            "Okay.",
            "Pretend to tap a key or whatever on the plain text file. They should add a letter at the beginning, which says, like name, not a name, so name, word, and question mark. So capital N, small W and a question mark as the first character, and that is -",
            "So you think they will get a list without context. They will just get this list.",
            "Yes, yes. Yes, in this first phase just the list.",
            "And then that means that what they label with the question mark that will come on to them in the Xml format, or in the more complicated format for the individual instances. And then they will decide for the for the instances.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "And - go on PERSON12.",
            "I just named entities like country names. They should be also ee anonymized?",
            "Yes. Yes.",
            "So Switzerland will be also anonymized?",
            "It should be replaced with some other country. I would say.",
            "Oh, if we have one country in transcript and another country in minutes? So it should be standard.",
            "No, it has to be the same.",
            "Has to be the same.",
            "We have to map them to for example we always map Switzerland to Germany.",
            "Well, what we could do we could say country ID and then two first letters of MT five sum of Switzerland.",
            "So if you take the MT five sum of the word Switzerland -",
            "Which, should I share the screen with you. You know what I'm talking about.",
            "So yes. Just annotators get the task to, mark all proper names the treat as proper names. So, we do not we do not exclude any proper names.",
            "Yes, we do not exclude any proper names, yes.",
            "Okay. It's just important for me to in the annotators.",
            "Yeah. And actually, I'm thinking about the geographical entities. So they should probably, take them as the geographical entity. So -",
            "Yes. So it's just should we use our system of name tag?",
            "Yes, ideally, yes. Definitely. So this can this could be -",
            "And PERSON9 doesn't know about our name tag, so he asked about Czech and named entity recognition.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Tell -",
            "At ORGANIZATION1 mmc slash name tag. So if you have -",
            "Yes I saw something - Can you send me the link? The latest version for.",
            "It's it actually works on the web as well. So, how do I exit full screen, and then a chat. ORGANIZATION1... And I don't - I cannot - I can chat only to host. I don't know why.",
            "You can chat -",
            "My chat -",
            "You can chat -",
            "My chat said that I can only privately send something to the host.",
            "To me. Well, send it to me, and I will send it to everybody, but one more question. Is Tuesday named entity? So should we also change that? Sunday, Tuesday?",
            "I wouldn't bother about Sunday, Tuesday. This is harder. So.",
            "So it's actually one more.",
            "But January.",
            "But the these are the months and that's that's there is just twelve plus seven names that we can do later on. And we will say, like weekday ex and we yeah. We can just like shuffle them later. So the these are - I don't think this is problematic.",
            "We definitely should handle years.We sh could handle months, but the days are not important.",
            "That's the way I see it, because like it's it's there too many days. So that's not distinguishing really.",
            "Yes, they - So but, if we use, these distribution, these markers. Should we there? So this if it appears to be quite, serious task for annotators, who should learn a little bit the system of abbreviation of named tag and use them. Or at least some maybe easier -",
            "I think that's - Well, I think that name tags is too fine grained for our purpose.",
            "It's fine grained, it's very fine grained, but it's it's grained, it's kind of on several levels. So we can use the first letter, not use, not do not use the se the second letter. So we can us that as a geographic this G, but -",
            "Well -",
            "But use this -",
            "Yeah. You could spend like unlimited time on doing this properly.",
            "Yes. That's why I'm -",
            "So instead of reading -",
            "Yes.",
            "Instead of careful reading of name tag manual and the named entities, yes, if you find a table which list the named entity types, send it to these annotators.",
            "Well, I know that I did that. I worked on that.",
            "Oh, you okay, yes. So just provide this table and say, and if you do it wrongly that's not, if you decide wrongly that's not -",
            "Yes.",
            "That's not a big deal.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "But you're definitely right that this list, should be first, and you can already PERSON9 who has just received the link from PERSON12 as well. You can copy, a few lines from this, paste it to the name tag web user interface, and it will immediately label it for you. So line is Javascript, catch NLPD, catch proffesor, parliament, rainbow, whatever that will immediately and PERSON5 up to PERSON5. That will immediately indicate that some of these words are names, and, there is actually no, no, but it would find them as well. So this list before it goes to the annotators. It should be processed through copy paste thing by name tag. And, actually, what named tag already recognizes as geographical entity, let's trust name tag. And let's simply exclude this and let's say: we do not need to ask annotators about this at all.",
            "The link that you sent me -",
            "Uhmhm.",
            "Is it a source word or is it online version?",
            "There - It has link to both.",
            "Oh, okay. And which one is better to use?",
            "I would just paste it through the web interface.",
            "Okay. Okay and -",
            "That's the fastest, so you need -",
            "Yeah.",
            "You need to do this once or -",
            "So there don't need to be sentences, I can just copy paste like twenty nine words in each line and it will give a -",
            "Give it a try. You will see I. I assume that it would work even as on list.",
            "Okay. So for now, I will I will do that and after that I will use named entity recognition for Czech meetings. This for English meetings.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we do the same thing for Czech meetings?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Is there anything else I should do?",
            "Probably not. So this in the first phase separately name tag will pre-annotate this list. Whatever name tag recognizes trust named tag. If it's a person's name that will immediately make me make all occurrences of this in the data as the confirmed anonymized person's name.If it's geographically entity, again.All these occurrences will be automatically confirmed in the training data. What name tag doesn't recognize here, give that to the annotators they will be assigning the name tag classes. Question mark if they don't know, and a small W or something like that, which means this cannot be a named entity in any case.",
            "And then, what is indicated as a named entity that will again be automatically, done on all occurrences. What is not a named entity that will, be labeled in the whole corpus as a not a named entity like, as I said: this word was suspected to be a named entity.But we have decided at the token, at that type level that it is not.So that next time, when we when we do the same thing, the this annotation is So you like without any effort.You get, you don't touch these anymore.",
            "So u so for the second step I guess we need to provide the interface for the annotators.",
            "Yes. So the interface for the annotators I would, I would make it again as simple as possible. So one option is that for each occurrence of a named entity, from the corpus. You would construct the words before that and after that.",
            "Uhmhm.",
            "You would create a line, which provides the context, so the same named entity would appear many times in this list in different contexts. And again, they would label these lines with the decisions.And then you would have a way of finding bank in the data where this line was, where this line is coming from, and in putting their, the, the, correct decision. And -",
            "Yes -",
            "The easiest way of doing this is that you process the corpus from top to bottom. You are extracting these lines, and while you are doing so you are immediately replacing them in the in the corpus with like suspected named entity number fourty three, fourty four, fourty five and so on.And this would be the number of li the line number in this in this list.So then you would, simply know that line fourty four or entity occurrence fourty four was labeled as a not a named entity and you would rip like search for that ID in the data, and you would label that like this was suspected to be a named entity. And at the word token level it was decided it is not.",
            "Yes, something that just came to my mind is that these are the unique words.",
            "This PERSON5 may occured in many meetings. Isn't it helpful if we indicate the number of -",
            "It is, yes. It would be helpful. And something else -",
            "Something else is that for example if this marked word for is the grey word. For example annotators indicate it as a..",
            "The question mark.",
            "Should we yeah, should we just should we indicate it in every meeting as a suspicious word, or -",
            "Yes.",
            "Or just in the meetings that it have been recognized.",
            "I don't understand like -",
            "For example this marked happens in two meetings. In one of them the named entity recognition model recognize it as a proper noun. And the other one it doesn't.",
            "Oh.",
            "Should we just -",
            "Would that happen?",
            "Yes, I guess for the names that are kind of question marks that will that would happen based on the -",
            "So I was assuming that you will be running the named entity recognizer only at this list, not at the full text. And that means that the unclear decision here. Like what would happen for the word type. So when I say we a word type and word token, I hope you understand exactly what this terminology means, right?",
            "And you know, what is word type and word to, yeah?",
            "Uhmhm.",
            "So when talking about this word type.Uh, it's, if the named entity recognizer make guess it's right. And it say, it is a not a named entity. That means that it becomes actually a grey thing. So the annotator will look at it and the annotator should think or MOG, can that be a name yes or no. If the annotator did decide that MOG can not be a name, which I don't agree with, right, if he decide it cannot be a name, then MOG will survive in the in the transcripts and....",
            "If the annotator says well MOG that could be a name in some cases. So in that case it goes up to the token level annotation.",
            "But in my procedure. I do not expect name tag to be run at the token level, but only expected to be run at this type level.",
            "Okay. And if the name tag makes the error and says like MOG is a name. Then I think there we're not making a big mistake for our purpose. That means that we are obscuring one more word in the minutes. As if it was like missheard or whatever. So if we like anonymised too much. But I don't think that is a problem.",
            "Just technical less than a minute remains at least after when we are got out please click on the same link again.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "Okay. So I guess I have a clear idea what I must do for now.",
            "And I will do that.",
            "Okay, that's great. Okay.",
            "Languages are they na proper names? German, English.",
            "That's a good question. I don't really know.",
            "Something else we want to discuss?",
            "Yes, yes. We wanted to discuss in the transcripts diarizations. The name of the -",
            "Person speaking.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So in brackets OB in brackets KI and PERSON3 is mostly you.",
            "Yes.",
            "And if to connect you and this you in the transcript itself and letter O in brackets or not. And if to - How to anonymize it means A, B, C, D unify all of them. So what to do with them?",
            "Well. I think that the ideal situation is that we would know what is the full name of that person, because that name can also appear in the transcript. And ideally, we would anonymize it the same way, as the name was anonymized in transcript. Sometimes we don't know this. In that case, we would like fail to preserve the link, and, we - So I suggest to use to rely on one or a pair of special characters. The in the Xml style. So I suggest to you use angle brackets. As that was, the law, with the laugh, with the law with the laugh there, right. You have highlighted this one.",
            "Laugh?",
            "So one line before under that or line seven that says laugh. So -",
            "Aha.",
            "Yeah. So I would suggest that we use also these angle brackets. And it would be something like speaker, ID equals and then in quotes the anonymized version of PERSON3.",
            "And -",
            "We must provide a table for the speakers. And then for each one we must map them to specific name. And then we use abbreviation for that name.",
            "Yeah. So when doing the anonymization, I think that you should, preserve the full name like PERSON10 here on line one. PERSON10 will be identified as a name. It will be identified as a name, at the type level probably. So it will be automatically labeled here. So what should change here is that instead of PERSON10, you would see opening angle bracket named entity, person, ID equals and now the hashtag of the so the hidden value that would be used instead of PERSON10. And of this bracket, then PERSON10 and then end of, named entity. So, so the angle bracket opened, slash, named entity and then angle bracket close. And with this, someone should, look at the meeting, and see the list of speakers that are here now with the O, C, N and so on. And, they should say that O equals PERSON10, sorry PERSON3, C equals PERSON10, D equals PERSON18, and so on. And, then, final post-processing, will replace this square, this round brackets letter with the whatever we decide again angle bracket convention. Like this is speaker, speaker's talking, and the ID would be the same ID as PERSON10 had in the anonymized version. And, that would still be like fully named content, but it would already have this stand of annotation, this layer of annotation. And then we only delete the contents, the PERSON10 and what remains would be the IDs.",
            "Uhmhm. The hash include should it be something sophisticated, or we just can use the hash for or something like that?",
            "So it's very important that this is a hash, so that you cannot reverse the value. You would have to guess what the value is that you would have to get the string PERSON10, in order to be able to come up to, to that. But I think any hashing would do. So I think it's it's okay to use python hashing.",
            "But if we use python hashing it would be reversable.",
            "Well, it depends what hashes, what type of hashes there is. So I would use MT five sum. If you use MT five sum, that is not reversible.",
            "Okay.",
            "So use MT five and cut some, middle letters of that.",
            "Okay. I got it. Ooh, so these are for each meetings, proper nouns for each meetings. So what you call there. And I just, I'm done, I don't have any other questions, if you have anything, this -",
            "Yeah, this is, and I saw these - I saw these partial names like PERSON17 and PERSON17.",
            "I think that the annotator should perhaps say, but this is what we know. And the annotator would know only at the at the token level, not at the type level. I know this at the type level already. But, the annotator could know only at the token level that his PERSON17 is actually PERSON17. But well, if we lose this. If we if we label this PERSON17 as a different person. Then I don't think there is a big problem, too big of a problem. It's not too common that the, well there is also this Chang but that's a misunderstanding actually. It's CZ ENG the corpus.",
            "Yes.",
            "All these Changs are misunderstandings in the transcript.",
            "Okay.",
            "So this is like we should not worry too much about this, because this is something which can go for ever. So -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If the if it is wrong PERSON2 survives there. I wouldn't be bothered.",
            "Even if it's instead of a corpus there will be some person's name. Yeah, it is noise, yes, but it is not too dangerous.",
            "Okay. So I guess I know what I should do. And if you need anything else, then -",
            "Yeah, okay, Yeah. Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Thank you.",
            "You're welcome.",
            "So if you need anything else, then please address it.",
            "Okay, thank you, I'll do.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, is there anything that I should the comment on or -",
            "Maybe I would like to ask you about PERSON15. Did you speak to him? So is he supposed to ma to work on the tool, what did y-what did he say?",
            "So I thought I answered to your email about this. So Pe.",
            "Mhmh.",
            "Yeah, I'll I'll say it aloud for others as well. So, PERSON15 is starting his Phd. Which is on speech recognition. And I would like to very much limit his involvement in the minuting and the tool for that, because it's like disturbing him from the topic. He is in Slovakia, and working, and he is hoping to come to LOCATION1 soon, because he still has the option. And he can also stay in the student dormes, and, and if he'll have more like focus for his studies in LOCATION1 then in Slovakia. And he, I've asked him and I would like him to transfer the tool to PERSON20 probably. So that PERSON20 would be the technical support person who would be doing the changes. So, yes, PERSON15 should find the time to, to help a little, but mainly to transfer that to PERSON20, right?",
            "Fine, PERSON20 are you okay with that?",
            "Yes, yes. I'm okay with that. So I need a session with PERSON15 to fully understand it.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then I can.",
            "Yes. So I think that he should you already be more responsive to emails. He is like he is responding to me now. And I know that he - There is some ground deadline may be today, so he's probably -",
            "Writing something.",
            "Aha, okay.",
            "Or tomorrow, I'm not sure, it's like some internal deadline soonish, very soon and then some other like more serious deadlines for this proposal in the coming days. But he should be responsive enough to make the call with you PERSON20 and, and tell you what everything is where and how to how to run it and what to modify and so on.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Well, great.",
            "You are making good progress with the anonymization. That's good. I've also talked to PERSON19 today about the, the like test annotation, the mock annotation. So PERSON19 knows everything I wanted to say, and it would be better, if he said it so that I can do other things, right, PERSON19?",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON19?",
            "Yes I'm here, sure.",
            "So this is this is what I was discussing with PERSON12 so that you in pairs, like two people will do some test annotation. Two people will do a test evauation of these summaries. And then we will see what everybody will be while doing this exercise like acting as the machine and acting as the evaluator. Everyone will take notes and write down. What was the most problematic thing. What were the problematic things. And then in the discussion we will see what people had as problems. And, everybody who is participating will learn so much about the task that we want to do, that then they will be in much better position to actually do the task. To implement the model and so on. Yeah, okay?",
            "Okay think I think PERSON3 thank you, you can also finish it.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay thank you and I'm I'm leaving for today, right?",
            "Thank you for joining.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye.",
            "Okay PERSON12 if you don't have anything to do with me, I just -",
            "Yeah,",
            "I'll do it as well.",
            "Yes, yes. Thank you PERSON9, thank you very much.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you too.",
            "Bye.",
            "Thank you very much, good bye.",
            "So PERSON12? We take a leave as well today? Have we anything to discuss?",
            "Probably yes, so I would prefer to do that now. I'm so I don't know what Ondra told now that PERSON19 should say us? Should we work on that, PERSON19?",
            "Yes, so we have to select some of the meetings. And then we have to - Two of us will work as annotators in a sense that we'll read the meetings.",
            "Could you -",
            "For example -",
            "Write it down, so if you speak with PERSON3 and you have this fresh understanding of what should be done, could you just I don't know in the agenda at least write it down.",
            "It's very small thing. It's no need for writing it down. I just explained it -",
            "But what should I, what should we do? Each of us.",
            "So yes, so. We are four, right? And we divide ourselves as two annotators and two evaluators. And then the annotators, the two annotators will take let's say twenty or fourty like twenty minutes, twenty meetings each. So I will take twenty meetings and PERSON20 will take twenty other meetings. And we will annotate them. So we will read the transcripts and we will produce the summaries, the minutes. And then the evaluators will evaluate them like using the procedure the manual procedure and will produce the scores. So that's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "It's just that.",
            "Okay. Should I - Or should I select twenty meetings, fourty meetings, or you -",
            "No.",
            "Automatically?",
            "Numbers I don't know about these numbers. But this is the idea, so we select some of the meetings and we work as both summarizers like we imitate the model, automatic model. Some of us, two of us will imitate the summarization part.",
            "I got it.",
            "And the rest will imitate the evaluation part.",
            "Well I got it. But who begins, who chooses the meetings, who chooses the number of meetings, when we'll do that.",
            "Don't know. I don't know. I mean we have to devide the roles.",
            "PERSON12? I will I will -",
            "I think you already did it. I think you already did it. But also choose the number of meetings and send us the minutes. PERSON8 has already prepared some evaluation form, we will discuss it and we will evaluate them. Hallo. Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON19 are you there? Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so could you could you choose these meetings and send them to you and PERSON20?",
            "Choosing meetings I guess you are more familiar with the meetings. So you should choose -",
            "Okay, how many meetings would you like to get?",
            "Uf, so how long - I don't know how much time do we have for this. But PERSON3 said -",
            "They are long. So it's really big work. That's why I'm asking. So one meeting is one hour long and to read the transcript and to create minutes it's a really big work.",
            "So it depends on a timing. So PERSON3 said that he spoke with you about this last week. And he wanted it done within this week.",
            "But we spoke about one meeting.",
            "Aha, one meeting.",
            "And not about creating annotations but about getting, about taking ready minutes and evaluating them on different ways.",
            "Yeah, so I want to ask PERSON12, so why do we like again do the minutes since the minutes are already there? Why not we only do -",
            "So this is also my question. I don't understand why should we create minutes. So this is.",
            "PERSON3 told to PERSON20 and what PERSON3 told PERSON19 and what PERSON19 told now. So as for me I would take I would just evaluate. So I don't want -",
            "To create twenty minutes myself. Even two.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Then.",
            "So annotators already created them. I think we should just evaluate.",
            "Yeah, yeah, right.",
            "So who is responsible for all of that? I just kind of lost in there task distribution. So PERSON3 now gave task -",
            "Yeah.",
            "To PERSON19, so PERSON19...",
            "With PERSON3 I think like I don't know like creating minutes again or as I don't know if I will find time for that or not, but -",
            "No. Let's not create minutes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Let's not create minutes, let's do evaluation. The question is when. PERSON19 -",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "PERSON19 please -",
            "Specify it, because we didn't understand the task.",
            "The task is very simple. We will annotate and then evaluate. And -",
            "Are you are you ready to annotate twenty minute twenty meetings? So -",
            "They don't have to be twenty, they don't have to be twenty.",
            "Okay I give one meeting for two annotator and he mostly needs a week to prepare a transcript and a minu nad minutes. A week for one minu for one meeting.",
            "So what?",
            "So say the number. How many meetings are you - How many minutes are you ready to prepare yourself?",
            "I don't know. It depends on the timing, I told you. You have to ask PERSON3 about the timing. When does he want this to be finished. And then -",
            "So please discuss it with PERSON3. You have him close in the office. Ask him how -",
            "In the office now, okay, I.",
            "How many minu how may meetings. One minu one meeting is about one hour long.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's always about one hour long.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How many transcripts he wants from us to read and to create minutes from and actually why. I actually I don't even understand why should we create minutes. But least somehow finish it and write it down somewhere, because otherwise we would we would not do that.",
            "PERSON3 is in this office now.",
            "Yeah, please finish it.",
            "Okay so I can go and ask him about the timing.",
            "Yeah, please do that. Thank you very much. I am afraid I have to leave now already. What about you?",
            "Yeah, okay. So let us meet tomorrow.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, wonderful. Please take care. Bye, bye.",
            "Yeah, you too. You too, bye."

            "It was live -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It was live streaming. Now it's. So, well, I think that we can discuss separately who what has done what, who has done what. And you have enter more data. PERSON2 probably would not want to connect anyway, because says the of his like hearing issues. There is PERSON4 and PERSON15 is not writing. Okay. Yeah. And I don't see PERSON6. So, I'll leave it connected while I'll clean up here in the in the lecture room.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "I know what you have been working on. So that's that's good. The Russians working caraoke star, yes. And transcript is processing. Audible cell ties data preparation first priority PERSON9 to test the script first.What script?",
            "So he basicly proposed that the ASR and the segmenter they should run separately.",
            "So the ASR - So I'll disconnect this - Now I'll hear you better.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Hi PERSON9.",
            "Ou PERSON9 is there so, right. Yeah, so, I didn't understand this - PERSON9 to test the script first, what script?",
            "So PERSON9 proposed that he would test the ASR and the segmenter independently, separately.",
            "No, no, just run it. And I would to review the scripts, not to test them.",
            "Yeah, exactly, sorry. Yeah, it should happen review.",
            "But for the audible cell ties submition we do want to run the byplan and for the locks for both, before the segmentor and after the segmenter. And then submit the locks after the segmenter obviously.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "This audible cell ties is preparation nothing that I send you an email yesterday morning I think.",
            "Yeah exactly.",
            "Okay.",
            "And then, and then I'm planning - Yeah, I'm also planning to open lot directed today itself. So it's a little small task and them whether this short time so a we get over the. I'm still Wonder Woman to do this calculation of for Czech transcript. With or without transcript. With or without true cancer I gave up I'm still for this sound this week.",
            "Yeah, but this, as you put it here a lower in the lower priority. The more the most important thing is the - And all of the all of the forced alignment process. It is not just. It's also -",
            "It's ORGANIZATION6 corpus.",
            "No these are the easy, the ORGANIZATION6 is easy. So there - Cause the 4 files we do not need any more, but the most important part are Antrecorp. And the longers chunks of supreme audit institutions, so the Austrian, Belgian and all these speeches. So these are the most Antrecorp. And, so, I'll just say and so long of chunks it's not important and so consecutive plus w what is that BGP test. So these are the more. We should not be looking at this yourself. So you should only run it. And not look at, not look at the - You don't know the sources like, as a participant in the audible SLT task, you know what the sound is, but you must not look a the true transcripts.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay. So you do not. Do you have the input files for this, or not yet?",
            "Input files, I think not yet.",
            "Yeah, exactly, PERSON14 needs to get all the input files for, PERSON13 has prepared those, splitting, so consecutive into smaller chunks and PERSON4 knows where they are too. So I don't know wheter we have anyone of them. No. So that's that's something that - Please e-mail - Please PERSON14 please ask PERSON4 and PERSON13.",
            "Okay.",
            "That they provide you with the with the forced alignment. They both know what the problems are and you were on the copy on the e-mails today. Did not make sense to you, so only now it will it will make sense.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the one question, these input files will be in VDD in VDD format, right?",
            "These files will be, it's OST.So one sentence per line. And some of them the so PROJECT3 are too long. It's 20 minutes in the row and so consecutive is already broken in smaller chunks manually by PERSON13.",
            "Although -",
            "So please these are critical, because these are most important path for the evaluation actually. The academy is like complementary evaluated. And Antrecorp is short. So you know where Antrecorp is, right? Or not?",
            "I can see the chaunce a bit mentioned.",
            "Yeah, SL thats it so that SLT. So PERSON14 can you also have a look at the Excel Sheet?",
            "So yeah, so this is - When releasing the set sorry here - Go to sheet number 3 forced alignment inputs and go to sell see 5. Just so that I know that you are you in. S System to the number varied. It s a sheet number 3 okay?",
            "Yeah, forced alignment inputs.",
            "Okay.",
            "So are you here?",
            "Yeah, I'm here.",
            "Yeah, so forced alignment inputs and go to see 5.",
            "See 5 - Already I can see.",
            "Yeah. Perfect. So I just wanted to mention that PERSON13 has already - So that there is some inconsistency of names now, and they are PERSON3, PERSON12 and PERSON11 and also PERSON11 and so on. These are person names. And I had to replace them in the released files with the with just language or nation names. So the maping is on the on the previous slide, in the column C, on the previous sheet in column C it says that PERSON11 is Belgian, and -",
            "Yeah cause I only process these script, these transcripts.",
            "Yeah, well you need, you are sitting into chairs now, as a participant of audible SLT. You should simply -",
            "Not look at these transcripts.",
            "Not look at these transcripts. And process the file switch are already called Belgian, Spanish or mainly Polish. And as the as the person who is doing the forced alignments who have this called PERSON3.And actually the sound is now separate.",
            "So it's the. So we don't have PERSON13 here on the call. And we also don't have PERSON4.",
            "I can fast text too?",
            "I'll be leaving very shortly myself. But, It's important told to them that we most up to date OST versions are in the in some repositor, which you do not have acces to. And so I'll put the paths so clean the code, thats it. Yeah, So this is up to date, and then we have test set, and also consecutive.",
            "I hope you not to speaking can you please mute your microphone?",
            "So Austrian, who is Austrian, which person is Austrian, if consequtive PERSON12 so PERSON12 is Austrian. So here - Here is the OST file. Austrian OST, then we have Dutch. Dutch is who, Dutch is PERSON11. So This is the full files, and we have - Right, text is timestamps. No, this is like sentence segmented text, too often too long, too long for forced alignment. And this is further split better for forced alignment and that's the location of that. So this is - Yeah, and the high priority is - So this one goes here. And the true thing is - So I'm here putting the path for the files that are in the most recent version and they are these are absolute path. And the it's probably I'll have to I think I'll have to do it myself so that is make sense to you. Unless, I know what you do now. So that is for you.And this should be done by PERSON13 and PERSON4, but they are not doing that.And also they should list will be Antrecorp is -So, yeah, okay I'll simply - And you should start Antrecorp, yes, you should start with Antrecorp because you already working on academy, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So. So please put the path of the files that you are processing here. Okay. So I'll make a remark here. And then you resolve that. PERSON14 please put the paths here.",
            "So one question. So at the moment some of the files I would process transcripts and in my. So do I need to create the support director in a not and we have about.",
            "Well, it is not to important where you process the files. So its - Only that after we are happy with the forced alignment, and after we have converted since to the subtitles for the caraoke for preview and the OST format that SLTF evaluates, than we need to have it versioned.",
            "Okay. Alright. I that.",
            "For the processing it's not important. The Antrecorp -",
            "I'm also aware of the and the Antrecorp.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So I'm copying now the Antrecorp with the texts, which is, which is okay. Or so this is - There it's - So here is the -",
            "If you are to change the line inside the cell you can use enter.",
            "Yeah, I'll check that out later. So this is Antrecorp. And then we have also Antrecorp depth. Yeah, so. These files of this. Oh, I see, it's yeah, Antrecorp files with the test are clean all audible cell ties. Then you need 16 kilohertz WAVs for the forced alignment or different once?",
            "16, 16 k.",
            "Yeah, so 16 k for Antrecorp. So here is now the Antrecorp depth and test. The Antrecorp test directories. So this is - And depth set is - Depth set - Since set is - Yeah, so it is just 2 files. So try processing Antrecorp. 2 WAVs are here and the OST files are here, right? So this is I'll highlight these in yellow. So this is something that you should drive first. There are good lenghts. The lenghts it is all ready. And then we will have one more one the right outputs output paths.So this is a I'll now orange the cells that you should try to populate.So this is the starting point for today. This is the hardest part. And then laid I'll also prepared bars or I'll have finally PERSON13 and PERSON4 to the path for these files. But It would be essentially the various similar to the Antrecorp. So try processing Antrecorp.",
            "Path, PERSON8.",
            "Okay, so. Yeah. Do we have PERSON15? Do we have PERSON4? Yes, PERSON4, so since when are you are you here? PERSON4 joined the just - Yeah, so, I'll have to leave already but it's important please ask PERSON4 to - PERSON4 can you hear us? Not does seem so. So it would works for PERSON4 -",
            "I text him.",
            "Yeah, yeah, never mind. I like do it. We have PERSON15 on the call, we have PERSON9. So I'll forced alignment selected. So -",
            "Sorry.",
            "So I think that I would like to hear from PERSON15 who is still on the call whether you have started pushing anything into the new repository for PROJECT2 test set. PERSON15, have you done anything on that yet or not? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, okay, so well - I have to leave. PERSON14, your real one with whom it work so far. So I do not hear anyone anymore at all.",
            "It's a deadline for EMT is tomorrow, right?",
            "Yes, it's ok, no, it's ok.",
            "Okay, so I really have to leave now. So PERSON4 please synchronize with PERSON14 on the on the audible SLT test set and depth set forced alignment files. Look at the forced alignment ALI inputs in the SLT data set sheet. So can you open that sheet well. PERSON14 has that sheet opened.",
            "Well just keep me in a moment please. Okay, I open, yes.",
            "Yes, so on the third sheet forced alignment inputs.I've just done a the yellow lines, which is a good input for PERSON14. So it is correct path now. It's the it's the version the one, that's important. The this is the version OST files. And he is already for the separation, and he should run the alignments, and produce OST files out of us to OSTP plus ASS files. So the OSTP files are what the SLTF should be.And the ASS files are the subtitles for preview.",
            "Yes, just a question PERSON8 about this Antrecorp. Have you chunk the WAV files there are a small.",
            "They are a small, they are already small, yeah?",
            "Okay.",
            "And, I would like what I would like you to do PERSON4 is to review the part that I have just highlighted. And so from B3 to D16, there we need to list the black versions.So this one the C3 for example, this is already good.So I'll remind this with green.And this one is unclear. This is also good but the rest is unclear. The WAV files should be also from the 16 kilohertz WAV files. And they should use the new names, not PERSON12 but Austrian and not Dutch but not PERSON11 but Dutch, right?",
            "This is what I renamed.So and similar thing has needs to be done for this.And most importantly, the splits, the splits will be necessary for this to work.So PERSON4 your priorities now are the SLT evaluation. When You get some outputs from PERSON14 and clean up of the stable in preparing the files that PERSON14 will digest.",
            "Yeah so, you mean the files for -",
            "Yes, all of this 7 lines, yes?",
            "It's not 7, it's 3 till 16.",
            "3 to 16? Okay. So you want somenthing PERSON14 can run force alignment.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "The czech is of lower priority, English is important. And the green ones ilustrate the correct path and -",
            "Okay so about academy I we have it now? So we can make it green also, because PERSON14 has.",
            "We list the a list the a the path there.",
            "Okay, 6 okay, yes.",
            "I'm highlighting with green. This is the ideal example. This is the Portuguese is the perfect thing.This is the full path to the files.The only problem is that this red, I'll make it red now.The the chunked version that does not does has an ugly name.The path is not the full path.And and there is a risk, which I have talked to talk about to PERSON13, there is a risk that the all Portuguese OST the concatenative file does not exactly merge the split file, because there were some small errors, I cut most of about this.So please like, like based on the line 3 prepare all the lines, all the English lines all until 16.",
            "Okay.Just I if it is possible I can do everything tomorrow, okay?",
            "Okay, if I have not done that myself then do it tomorrow, okay, yep.",
            "Okay, I will do everything because tomorrow I have a lot of times, and they can put for these.And so I'm writing, and everything is fine. And so you want to create a case similar to academy test set we have now and for here we should you mean -",
            "The path the path the path names.",
            "Yes. It's okay.",
            "Okay, yeah, so, thanks, so, please all of you who are here go over the yours your comments and discuss anything. I need to run already. So thanks for your time sorry that it's less organised. I suggest that we all rehandle the Doodle poll. So please update your doodle poll and I figure out better time for myself because as I'm disorganised at this point now, because of the extra workload with the remote lecturing. It's it's difficult to run these meetings.So from next, we probably choose a different time. So please everybody please updated the Doodle poll.",
            "Thank you. And unready have any usable to PERSON5?",
            "No, no.",
            "Okay, I'll contact you.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Yeah, so, what's new PERSON14?",
            "So yesterday I was working on this caraoke as timeview and spent on time introdate comes on. So it is like partial than complete but not yet perfect because I was too - The main thing would refix in this caraoke is that. We would has to be given it's all timestamps and didn't know what that I give the one segment and I had - Now I give the timestamp of one complete segment. I didn't know view that what level timestamps and what level timestamps.",
            "Yes.",
            "So I'm working on that. Because the forced aligner is actualy doing the what level timestamping. And to test that the caraoke you should also have word level timestamping. And how it shows the word has already been spoken. So if you see the video and if you have, okay, I think I did not. Okay, I was forwarded the e-mail of how I process those. And -",
            "And did you use CTM?",
            "No, no. I did not use CTM. I created AAS file using a software OTHER.",
            "Aha. Does the what level of alignments?",
            "So yeah, so it automaticly does the word level alignments itself. So which are drop I'll to realize. Yeah, that is that is our main focus and I completely miss that.",
            "Yeah, it now works so I if you - Yeah he made fields I can lock time transcript if you - Because that's like a clickable make it automatic for all the scripts. So now because I have okay AAS file subtitle forward I can make a Python script. And I can subtitle for all the -",
            "Okay.",
            "All the corpus that we have.",
            "And with the audible SLT, did you do anything, ready?",
            "No, I not think today is the today I'm coming this.",
            "Okay. I'm finishing the paper about subtitler. For. The deadline is 25th. So it's still plenty of time. And so it's seem that I don't have to do anything with audible SLT, do I? Right now. So I can write the paper. And I found I found that the one of the score parted was different than I thought so it's not important for the others. Still different name. So what next? PERSON15, are you here?",
            "Yeah, yes, yes.",

            "Nothing I worked on I test the data for preparing WSLT. I don't know. You for Euros because PERSON8 told me to collect test to prepare test the data. So right now I'm working on 3 languages Polish and Polish, German, Russian. Because Polish is not in the level in the last PROJECT1 CDs. So now it helps to test WSLT and that languages. So, right, 3000 sentences were collected for 3 languages. And almost cleaning part is done. And after that I will collect from other 43 languages. So this is the update. And I have already update ORGANIZATION3 locks.",

            "JSON file - So PERSON8 forrest ask me to process this Antrecorp test which is an 17 and 18 and 19.",
            "Yes. So, aha. Okay, so in this case you will create yourself the JSON file, yes?",
            "Yeah, I think, because I have the Python script.",
            "Aha, if you have Python, okay - So if you have Python script PERSON2 saw for the rest. I will clean everything tomorrow. I will give you the pass for all files, okay?",
            "Yeah, so that's the, moment, so these I meant the subtitles for this test, they are in VDD format or do that.",
            "There, in VDD format there - You are speaking about academy?",
            "Yeah, Antrecorp.",
            "Antrecorp I haven't seen it. But you can check if you need a script you can tell me about it after okay in two hours. Tell me what exactly the files and what you need and maybe I can create this script for it.",
            "Alright, alright.",
            "Okay. Okay, so see you later.",

            "Was he. In second. So hear you and see me right?",
            "Yeah, I cannot see you, but I can hear you.",
            "So the connection is too slow perhaps because I'm probably - Or maybe I'm not sharing the camera.",
            "Yeah, do we do we need to share camera as well?",
            "No, no.",

            "So the we should be muting ourselves, when we are not talking.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "PERSON8, you can mute yourself, while you are not talking. Yes, okay. And I would feel like to hear from PERSON6 if he is on the call. Because I see him connected, but I don'tsee him there. And I don't hear him. Well, maybe not there, never mind. Lets - okay, lets get started anyway. And this call is being recorded because I'm also collecting various meetings. So I hope that all okay with that been recorded and. And actually we would like to release this publicly, But with some delay of like this is a so this is not longer interesting. And there is a good point, We will send you a link to google form, where you will fill in, that you agree, what this to be used and there you can specify the limit, what would like this-which you require to be, To be followed before the data is released. Okay, so, thanks a lot for coming. You all know this document, the surge 2020 organization. This is just the envelope. The more important document is the PROJECT2 topics. And another document, which is now becoming very important, will be this google sheet, with all the things, that you have done. And the point of these meetings, And I would really like to have every week. Next week it should be on Thursdayand then until the end of exam period it would be Thursdays. And then we will vote all again, what is the best day. The purpose of these meetings is for everybody to say, what they are working on, And what they have in mind for the upcoming weeks, And the reason is for me to collect this credits. This is important. So whatever you don't sell to me or not getting any bonus for. Remember that. And also, we must synchronize ourselves because no there more people doing the same thing. So for examplenow, PERSON7, are you on the call? Can you confirm that you can hear us?",
            "Well, I am on the call, but I have a lot of problem understanding you so.",
            "Yes, I'm talking too fast I guessand the microphone is not perfect. Yeah. So the point of the call is to make sure, that people know, what others are doing, And they nicely, well like a collaborate, in the sense that no work is done twice. And no data is downloaded twice and so one. So we have now, also PERSON10 here, he is going to -",
            "Bring a chair.",
            "Yes, to bring a chair. And so the - So, the - So right now, I would like everybody to go like one by one and summarize in a minute or 2, What you have been working on this week. And everybody should very carefully listen to this and see any possible synergy. So I've asked a number of people for now to download the ORGANIZATION1 database data. This has to be downloaded only once obviously and has to be convert to plain text only once. So whoever does that, please let everybody else, know. And this and it's similar. So after we do this summary of activities, there are being worked on, or finalized, Then we can spend the rest of the half hour for planning, What is the most important next thingand who would like to pick up for. But there is also less importance. More important is to avoid duplicating our work. Yeah, so, well, I'm not working on anything specific myself. I'm just starting. I'm just telling people what to do. So I think that I should not - Well, I can give you very brief, thin, brief summary. So there is the again, university open day, next Wednesday, For which we are doing domain adaptationand then there will be on the 12th of February a dry run of the workshop, that we are going to give for the ORGANIZATION1 congress. So that is two and half hours of hands on experience with natural language processing tools. 5 colleagues at least from ORGANIZATION7, going to the ORGANIZATION5 officesand presenting these NLP technologies. And we would do again like this subtitled. It will be held in English. The domain of competition fix, that there is tools. So that will be the next event, for which we should like try the domain adaptation surge again. So this is important for you PERSON7. In the sense - So, so after PERSON1's tool, the next occasion to test things is the is this English given presentations of the tools. If we don't manage to adapt our systems, that's not too important. We will be recording the session anyway. There will be one more of session, and then there will be one more dry run. And there will be the final session on the ORGANIZATION2, or at the ORGANIZATION2. So for the February of 12th, we can live with current models. But if we have something adapted for this domain, then even better. So this is my summary. Then quickly in the semester, the Monday seminars will start again. And we could again use it. Which of that domain adaptation practice. Yeah, so, that's from me. So I don't know, maybe we should just follow in a circle. So the important thing is, whether the people remotely present, Can confirm, that they've understood at least something.",
            "Yes, so, I can confirm, that I've understood everything, what PERSON5 said and I write them. And if you guys want, I can say, what I have been doing like since a week.",
            "Okay, Yes.",
            "Or what I plan to do next week. Okay, So, last week, I started do transcribing the YouTube videos. That was shared by PERSON10. So the English transcriptions are done. And the Czech I'll do like today, or I'll start it tomorrow. The next thing, that I spent last week, like the weekends preparing transcript for the Monday seminar. And also into getting the PERSON6's ASR, followed by segmenter. And I also did a voice domain adaptation and domain adaptation. And talk adaptation and speaking of the words. Speaking of the words and the common of the words and substituting them in the dictionary. But I realized, this for one them properly because I because it was. So I feel needed to was not properly. So this is something, I need to recollect again. And try it to work next time. The next thing, I did, there was preparation of the English segmenter. And the next task, which I need to focus on is the. Because I observed some terrible scores onone form, which is the period. So I need to focus more on sentence, boundary detection on both English and Czech segmenter. Things I need to do, is in-coming days, integrate PERSON9's audio compression on these YouTube videos. And progress more on the PERSON3 36 empty models and doc translation, and basically like that PERSON12. So that the work is not duplicated again, as more on their size. And, yeah, and spend more time on integrating office and text additions from PERSON4. So that's it from me.",
            "Yeah. So who you I misheard about the models. So what is your plan with the English 36 models? What exactly do?",
            "So, exactly like I lost some I do not do that. There was not documentation. I've been would hope to going their have been some hard to use the them. So he sent me some instructions and I've been to follow that. Yeah, so, I've to be that the work is not duplicated.",
            "Yeah, I see. Okay, so, your goal is to get ORGANIZATION4 models used in our pipelines.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. And there is one more person to synchronize on what the launching of these models. And that's PERSON3.",
            "Okay, so, I.",
            "PERSON3 successfully managed to run these models, and he is developing. He is using the models for the paraphrasing.",
            "Okay. So he is successful. I should pick up his hand to give them one medium.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Or maybe our.",
            "PERSON12, or PERSON3 or.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you, okay.",
            "So now we can PERSON4. Are you?",
            "Yeah. So I've already, I am. My work include this document. So recently, I downloaded some new corpora of interpret spoken language. So it's a EPIC ORGANIZATION6 interpretation corpus and ORGANIZATION6-ST. These are corpora created by us. And I'm trying to do your part, and I'm downloading all of plenary session from your parliament since July 2018. And 1.7 terabytes of audios, videos interpreting in 22 languages. And it's a lot of work to process them. These individual speeches, and so I am not doing any further work from this. And I was mailing with your webmasters, cause they were complaining, that I used there website too much.",
            "And they suggested, that they implement a feature for mass downloading. And I asked them to enable to create such corpora, together with transcriptions and interpretations. And I don't have any -",
            "Response.",
            "Any response yet so. So I don't feel I even this, but will be. My main project, until 6th of March is multi-source spoken language translation research. And I bring it for English and German into Czech.",
            "Yeah, so.",
            "So I'm starting.",
            "Yeah, so, this meetings are especially for the ORGANIZATION1 event.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So what you have described, can very much help that. Because all the data that you have gathered, would be used to retrain the ASR models. So, that's an important thing. So that people, we do not have PERSON11 and unsure if. PERSON6, are you on the call or not?",
            "Yeah, I somehow managed to get here, but I have some problems with hear to hear you. I do not know why because -",
            "Yes.",
            "But now, now it's okay. Now it's okay.",
            "Yes, so, it depends where I am if I'm on the correct side of the microphone, or not perhaps, as well. So the data that PERSON4 mentioned, these can be used for all the models, that we are training ourselves. And which also like talk to others, ORGANIZATION8 to train their models better. So we need to somehow include them in the surge. So that they also improve - They have at least too of the model, until the congress. So that we would perform better. But PERSON4's main goal until the Feb 6th deadline is to experiment with multiple translation. And if this is successful, if we see an improvement from the additional sources, Then this is something, which we would directly use in the surge afterwards. And there will be a requirement for PERSON8 to have the pipelines ready. So that - We have process multi-source and create English by integrating the many sources. So this is until this until this until we choose some us some utility, We do not consider it a requirement, or we are not planning to run multi-source translation at the event. But if it is if it works, then it would be great contribution. Okay, thank you.",
            "My last part is that I started to do the binding worker for automatic speech recognition and mediator. So we can connect JASPER and Kaldi to mediator. So we won't need to connect them separately as well.",
            "Okay.",
            "To this.",
            "So I've already collaborate with PERSON8 for the compression thing.",
            "Okay.",
            "And this week, I was working on the PROJECT1 thing.",
            "So is it? If we tested?",
            "I don't know the efficiency. The PERSON8 is not given me any updates of that like the efficiency of that. So I except that I was working on the like the PROJECT1 thing, trying to clear on with it. And this waiting for the data. As you said from PERSON3.",
            "So what the what the compression? So PERSON8, can you tell us, how - If you manage to test the compression, that hopefully was somehow proposed by PERSON9. And do you manage to test it? What - How much?",
            "So PERSON9 has differently updated me the compression, and but I am - I was unable - I didn't find time to deal it with the current my current pipeline. Because I was s I spent like last weekend on preparing for the Monday seminar. And audio compression was not on me focus for the Monday. So probably, maybe I coming 1, 2 days, that should be integrated. And I'll be sharing our statistics and how much laws are we able to -",
            "Make.",
            "Come up with compression.",
            "So another option would be to tell PERSON9, how to run it. So that PERSON9 could connect to the mediator and test it test it himself. So if that would be easier for you, Instead of evaluating it for PERSON9 to update a review that works for some of the setups. PERSON9 would check out the crews control, do the set up from his laptop and connect to his laptop, With his laptop connected to wired connection and evaluating the ASR quality with compression, or without compression. That's another option.",
            "I completely agree with you. So what I am going to do next, is that we can take any of the Monday seminar revised transcript. And we can to take that as a test set, And we can do as uncompressed and check the word error rate, And we can do a compressed pipeline and again check the word error rate. And let's see, how it goes, so here we got some propose.",
            "Yeah. But what I'm proposing is, that not you, but PERSON9 would do this.",
            "Yeah, exactly, PERSON9 exactly, yeah. So I'm going to instruct all these to PERSON9, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so that PERSON9 runs this. And I would like to see the evaluation in two ways. One without mediator being involved, if that is possible. That is -",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "That is not possible for the - No, no, no it is not possible for PERSON9 to do because he -",
            "Yeah, exactly yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Systems. So we could do it via the mediator. And that is more important.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So start with this one only. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "A thing, that PERSON9 was talking about -",
            "To collaborate with PERSON4 and what we did.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, but that's for the other purpose. It's not for not for the ORGANIZATION1 Congress.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so it's there anything in your plans from the surge, Like what is going to directly help the ORGANIZATION1 Congress?",
            "As of know I'll be ready to interest like for example, the compression. Because the bandwidth is, an issue there. So for example, if the compression is not really effecting the ASR output that should be a really good thing. And I think.",
            "I meant in the in the document of Monday test, there is a list of wanted things.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "So if you don't have any immediate thing to try, then have a look. And tell me, which topic you would like to work on.",
            "Sure.",
            "Okay, thank you. Yeah.",
            "Okay, so now, I'm working on the framework or for example test set for evaluation of simultaneous translation. Where can we have audio file and we want to translate it to s to the target language. And I wanted to propose some ideas. Some of them are novel, some of them not because they are were represented before. For calculating the delay, BLEU score and, all of them. I know, into the end yesterday, maybe no one account working on because we had a problem of segmentation. As you know, for example the segmentation in the difference part, could should shouldn't necessary - Is the same as the segmentation. But empty my sheet, empty output prepared. So I we had a problem of segmentation, when we wanted to calculate delay. So I decided from yesterday to do to propose a new idea. Because using there segmenter. We can segment both of them, but the problem is, when we want to calculate delay. Sometimes it has, some words are repeated more than once and it could make some problem. So now, in our tool set, I want to report who define delay. One segmenter based on time, exactly on the time, when they set us. And I report this delay. And also the delay based on the MWAR segmenter. So now, I want to propose both se both of them and so maybe.",
            "So let me comment on this. So this worrying that PERSON2 is doing, is generally preparations for the SLT shared task. So that we have a reliable tool to evaluate submissions in the shared task. And the shared task, that we are running at IWSLT is directly aimed to help PROJECT2 in the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. So the domain will include - The data set will include our domain and all that. But I would like to somehow even further, or be on this IWSLT shared task. The evaluation script of PERSON2 to be used in this surge, in this in this gradual improvement of our systems. So this is something for PERSON8. I would like PERSON2 and PERSON8 to get directly in contact. And PERSON8 to provide PERSON2 with some output files as transcribed. And the reference transcripts, so that you can test the tool. It will be like testing booth. It will be testing the performance of our base-line system and measuring. And it will be testing your tool, whether it evaluates the files correctly. So there is like three people, that will work together very closely. That, one is PERSON8, who has the access to the pipelines. And PERSON10, who will know everything about the data. And PERSON2, who knows everything about the evaluation. And I would like regularly to have like measurements of the ASR, end-to-end, quality, delay, and flicker. In the on the systems, that are integrated. So that is that is the immediate help, That your work will provide to the to the ORGANIZATION1 Congress.",
            "Okay, it will be -",
            "Yeah, so PERSON8 is PERSON8 is in India until end of January, is arriving in early February. So it's not going to help us with the with submission and prepare afterwards.",
            "Yes.",
            "And it would be great, if you could set up -",
            "Exactly.",
            "A regular evaluation of our pipelines.",
            "Just we have some intermediate data to test our framework, And it's our papers, so we have it before that. Yes, it's could be caused after start, which and I can have a which can I have a meeting with PERSON8, And we can test everything so.",
            "Yeah, okay. Thank you.",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Can PERSON2 and all of? Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "Yeah, so the next one is PERSON12.",
            "In the la - In this weekend, last week, I worked on data collection to find the data, Where is labeled of 42 languages especially for monolingual languages. So I have I have already shared with PERSON5 and PERSON10 and PERSON9 to. There is a - A link is already available. In the one link is in the one link 22 languages data available. It's like a monolingual. We can see monolingual, But.",
            "Okay. So neither do I. I just - Okay.",
            "It 'a the name of this. Okay. I'm just scared now, where is the link? Okay. It's a. Sorry. European of auditors web site. 42 languages, 42 European languages.",
            "You know something about some excel, that you sent to us?",
            "Yes.",
            "Or, what is that? Can you?",
            "So maybe, maybe it's anyone so we can edit. Edited. And then copy and send it by plain mail because I also didn't receive that. That so google is not sharing the properly -",
            "Okay, so I'm hoping.",
            "What?",
            "So, okay.",
            "Yes so you are scanning the websites.",
            "Yes.",
            "And maybe others list it in the Google sheet.",
            "Yes. I have also searched the parallel data that I ignored the. Because most of the data is available of the other six languages. And we require it ORGANIZATION1 Congress. And we had 7 languages so -",
            "The Italian is not -",
            "Yeah, Italian is not included, so I exclude Italian. So German, French, Spanish, English, Czech. And so it is already mentioned, but we need to download all the PDF documents.",
            "Yeah. On this - So now PERSON7, can you hear us? PERSON7, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, I can.",
            "Yeah, so I think, now it is very important, That you and PERSON12 will synchronize on the thing tools. Because both's you and PERSON12 need to convert all the many file formats, Especially PDFs, that are hard to process. And you both have some tools for that and you also, both of you need to convert it to corpus styles. So one sentence per line. And if it's parallel text, then - That's that is not for you PERSON7, but that would be for PERSON12 to aline in that more sentences and so on. But getting from random file formats to the sentence oriented plain text, is something which both of you have to do. And it would be a big pitty, if you did it twice. So please, be in touch. You needs it differently, like the way PERSON7 needs it is for smaller sets of files. And more or less interactively. The way PERSON12 needs it is to have it parallelizable on the on the cluster, So that you can process a huge collections of files. So the this setup is slightly different. But still, the underlying tools would be would be the same. So please, stay in close touch. So you use both Tokenizer. PERSON7 and I don't know, what PERSON12 use -",
            "I use for this. For PDF text convertor.",
            "Yeah, I don't I don't - So yes, so simply -",
            "I've been I have already sent two PDF files -",
            "To you and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Everyone.",
            "Yeah, so lets work a little bit of evaluation. Which of the tools is easy to use and produces good results? So PERSON7, please be in touch with PERSON12 and make sure, that you both use the best tool.",
            "Yeah because the most of the tool like G or for German, is working fine.",
            "And work the for gives really bad.",
            "Yeah, okay, so It could be language dependent.",
            "Yeah, language dependent. So I think we can use different tool like every word is a word can works PDF.",
            "Yeah, Yeah. And all these are Linux based.",
            "Yes -",
            "All they can be run -",
            "And anyone -",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, that's good. So PERSON7, please, confirm again, that the voice was good, that you understood us.",
            "Well, I understood only a part of thing, But I will get in touch with PERSON12 and whatever is needed.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, it's it's not only needed, it is it's that what PERSON12 knows, can help you with your bachelor thesis. You should benefit from that experience as well. So it's it's mutually beneficial.",
            "Okay, thank you. And now we have PERSON10 here.",
            "Yeah. So my job's to have an overview of all the data, we use for the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. To integrate it and to create test sets, test sets using them. So you've anyone had some data source. I have list the whole that all things and I will I have do a store on the cluster. So basically, I've I've done part cluster overview. All this all this things, that we use as a source of data. And I also worked with people, which do the manual work, Or for example creating transcription, translations, or the stuff. So I am reworking with them giving them tasks to do and them, hiring them. It's cool.",
            "Yeah. Not in this thing yet, but later, when - So right now PERSON10 is mainly working on the IWSLT test set, Or test set and that we have to released. And these IWSLT, that's spoken language translation from English into two languages of our interest only. So only into Czech and German. And beyond that, PERSON10 will be also supervising and knowing, Where the pits are for the old language pairs and translation directions, That we want for the ORGANIZATION1 Congress. And once this test set is stabilized. We would really like to run the regular evaluation. So that's, what I was telling earlier, That PERSON8 should regularly process the test sets with pipelines. And use the evaluation tool by E PERSON2. And these numbers should be then like a picked up, or collected by PERSON10. So that we can know, that all these numbers are comparable in some way. So by this - It - So PERSON10 should be collecting, not only the numbers, but the actual outputs of the system. And doing sanity check of the as well. So maybe, it would be PERSON10, who'll be running the tool by PERSON2. In the end. Ok. So we have also PERSON6 on the call. So PERSON6, if you can report work briefly.",
            "Yeah, hi, I've done I've done the forced alignment. It's the on the it's in the repository, in the cruise control, on the - In the in the folder ORGANIZATION3 Jasper ASR. So there's a demo and some README, which you can check and you can run my ASR. And you can run the forced alignment. And there is there is also information about where the - Where the actual installation is in the cluster. Because you have you have to use custom environment, Python environment and Pytorch environment to run my models. So you can do it only in cluster. And now, I'm working on onlinezation of my ASR. Because as you may know, I have problems with transcribing, The running window, which cuts the words in the middle. And then the then the language model does strange things, To the all words in the whole transcription. So that's, what I'm currently working on.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you. So do we have anyone else on the call? Doesn't seem so. So well, time's up. We were we were 5 minutes -",
            "Working I working back translation.",
            "So we are running same - We are going to plan and we are going to implement a back translation in the next week.",
            "Yeah. So after collecting a data, or before, we can run that and - Before, like okay. We are working on English to Czech languages.",
            "So well, back trans - There is multiple occasions, on which we can we can use these systems. The first occasion, for which we could try, is the talk by PERSON1 on Wednesday already. And then we actually need to find tune systems to be deployed by Wednesday. I am not sure, if this is feasible, or not. Even if it's not feasible, to deploy it by Wednesday, We need to gather these better models, where the weeks for all the languages. So ASR all ASR languages to the English. So all the 6, or 7 ASR languages to the English and then from English into all the target languages. So for that, you need good pipeline. So that every week, you will have a new model adapted to this. So I think, it's to use the Wednesday opportunity to have better PROJECT1 systems as a good thing. So but there - Well, I'm telling bet I'm telling b saying better PROJECT1 systems. To English?",
            "Czech to English.",
            "Do I fix it?",
            "So what is the current status of Czech to English? One plan for was the current of the.",
            "And I implement it way, how to improve it into the missing characters.",
            "I can reshare this in one day to be f well, fix the missing characters and improves BLEU by one point. One decimal point.",
            "One decimal point. So right now, in the pipeline we use Czech to English by PERSON1. Now.",
            "We can use both.",
            "Yeah, so which did we which one did we use a last week for, or?",
            "No, maybe it was ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Yeah. So this is something very important. We need to know what we are using. And we need to know, which one of them is the best. So there is an important evaluation request. PERSON8, could you evaluate on PERSON1's recorded talk? Which on the - Well, we don't have - That's it. We have only the transcript we don't have the translation. What data set can use for Czech to English?",
            "We can translate like.",
            "Bad.",
            "So well, I think, that simply obtain that. Lets do it, lets do just -",
            "Or just thing convert to systems.",
            "Yeah, exactly. So please, PERSON8, in preparation for Wednesday, Please, process PERSON1's dry run of the talk. Would all be Czech to English. Setups, that you can use, in the pipeline, that are already integrated. On Monday, we'll interest in like models, that do text translation, We will interested in, what is integrated in our speech processing pipeline. And please, send as the outputs, or put it to the -",
            "PERSON1's folder. So that will be, that will be - Get in touch with PERSON4. So that you know, which model is which. It will be the transformer by PERSON1, it will be the PROJECT1 by PERSON4. It could be PROJECT1 by PERSON4 with the missing letters in it.",
            "Yeah, if PERSON4 fixes it. And it could -",
            "Yeah. And it could be and that from my point of view from my point of the of the more important. It could be PROJECT1 by PERSON4, finetuned on the parallel data, that we will create by back translation, Or maybe we find other parallel data in the domain of competition linguistics. So I think, that on for example for example on Monday, PERSON8, you could evaluate the existing systems. And well, I evaluate, I mean, you run them and have the outputs. We do not have the reference translation. And on Tuesday, PERSON4 could fine tune the system. And on Wednesday morning, we will decide, whether to d - Which one to deploy for the event. Right?",
            "It's okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "But lets give it a try.",
            "Sure, sure, sure. So one question, do we have some own data on PERSON1's talk? That we think of.",
            "We have a source audio, that's the one, that's PERSON11 - It's it's - I can say you'd path, but I think you must have the path. It's the recording, that I have done with PERSON1 recently. There is in the domain adaptation 2020 January 29, PERSON1 there should be there, there is the audio, And there is the transcript, and PERSON11 has corrected the transcript manually.",
            "Okay, okay, okay.",
            "Would you see any? It's about 20 minutes of audio.",
            "No, I - I haven't I actually have I haven't open the access.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "So far I followed this so and I'm I'm probably something to progress so.",
            "Okay. So I'm the a - At least, and maybe it is not totally of you, but it's clearing my head, What we should try with the - Translation before this Wednesday. What the happening? Okay, So I think, that's we are 12 minutes beyond out time, let's stop it now. We could spend months talking on this. So.",
            "Sorry, to interrupt to you PERSON5. I want thing to say to maybe PERSON2 and PERSON4. I would like to use some in-domain data from - Like European data to train the segmenter, like English and Czech segmenter. And use PERSON2's evaluation tool to see, how they are doing. The - In to the models, we have from Czech.",
            "Okay, So. But I think I thnik, that should be ready - Okay, I think, the tool should be ready next week.",
            "They have to be ready. No, no, I think because it's ready, but every time we have some new assumption.",
            "I and -",
            "Yes. And if I can get the first amount of data and after that, after the some is more test, I think, that the tool is ready and you can use it.",
            "Okay, okay. Then I'll use this week maybe to train - To get in touch with PERSON4 and get European data to train a new segmenter, without like.",
            "And I think I'm available next week and whenever you want, we can we can have a meeting together. And we can -",
            "Sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, we can discuss for on this topic, Yeah. Yeah, this is never-ending.",
            "Okay, the next week, I'm not available on Thursday and Friday because -",
            "Sure, sure, sure.",
            "I am -",
            "Okay, okay, okay. No problem.",
            "Yeah, okay. So well, the next week, I'm also not available on Friday. So whoever is available, we'll meet on Thursday. And we have the session on Wednesday. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot to all. If there no further questions and no further comments then -",
            "Thank you. Thank's. Bye, bye.",

            "The problem is that we haven't that defined what does it mean to add new content.",
            "Like kind of the information is already there more or less so...",
            "New contents. Yeah, it depens on the definition. That's right. Yeah, the multilinguality is not there. Yeah, cause I don't know much about it actually but I think we maybe say we can just -",
            "We have the paper about that.",
            "So... So I guess the paper that cited there the PERSON5 for the multilinguality this is what we'll kind of appear there and yeah. That's just the last one.",
            "That's the last one.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Conclusions.",
            "Conclusions are not optimal but -",
            "So the other, the other, sections are finished?",
            "Are there not finished but I would say the content is there.",
            "Oh. The next phase should have been commenting on, on others text. It doesn't mean to comment on text that is not finished at all.",
            "So the content is there. So the text is not final. It's kind of, yeah. So I'm not planning to add new content. I'm just planning to rewrite what's already there..",
            "So you didn't understand what, what it is content. Yeah, because - Yeah, in the next week we should, we should -",
            "Like if you have -",
            "Have it and comment everything so...",
            "Yeah. Like I don't know if you have a box of chocolate and you just plan to arrange the chocolate nicely so you're not adding new content, you're just rearranging what's already in the box. So that's my take of content.",
            "So - So now we know what, what - What are you think and you have still 13, 13 hours to -",
            "OK.",
            "To arrange the chocolate in the, in the box.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Do you plan to add, some pictures there?",
            "Yeah, I don't know. I talked about it repeatedly that I'm not good at pictures. I tried adding one picture and that's about the way I can add pictures so just... Extract them from some paper and, and put them there.",
            "Yeah, this is fai.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But so this is extracted from, from PERSON23.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So I don't know how, how many such paper we sh, we, how many s, these copied so pictures are there.",
            "So it's kind of like if you OK with images like that I can put there images like that. But I'm unable to create images.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is just a png extracted from the paper. So I opened the paper in Inkscape and I degroup it and I saved just the image into the file and png. And I put it here. So that's like the best I can do I guess.",
            "Should.",
            "Into our book?",
            "I don't know. Maybe we should at least check the licence of the paper.",
            "Yeah, if it is, if it is ORGANIZATION1 paper or -",
            "Something -",
            "It should be OK.",
            "We cite...",
            "Yeah. I, I actually don't know like we definitely need to cited and said that it's from that work.",
            "Yes.",
            "And... Yeah, I actually don't know like to rules like, I think it depends on the licence of each of the papers. So I think it -",
            "That you cannot do it - If it's not PERSON24 then I don't know. If it's some -",
            "You can -",
            "Created comments then you probably can do it.",
            "If it's from ORGANIZATION1 antology it's, it's creative comments.",
            "OK. This is archive but archive lists the licence probably somewhere.",
            "Yeah. You need to specified the licence that's OK.",
            "Where do I find it? PERSON23. Because I know that I need, needed to specify -",
            "Yeah.",
            "The licence now but I don't know where it appers -",
            "Specify but -",
            "Licence. Here. Yeah, archive, non exclusive. Yeah.",
            "That this is bad.",
            "So, so it doesn't give me any -",
            "No.",
            "Any rights. It's just for archive. So would need to find if it was published somewhere else.",
            "We could - Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Let's open the pdf. OK. Yeah, it doesn't same. This is it. OK. Proceedings of something on ORGANIZATION1 web. And... Yeah, it's, it's nakl so when is, when is nakl it should be OK you say.",
            "Yep.",
            "OK. And should we, I don't know, explain that somehow like that the licence allows that or I don't know what the nakl licence is like. If we have to include the licence or something like that.",
            "I think it's creative comments but... But I think it, it wouldn't hurt if we explicitly state it.",
            "Like even what page of the paper it is and, and, and under what lesson it is.",
            "Yeah, so I can easily cite the pa, page. This is what I learned recentely. Yeah, it's just covereted comments by so I only have to atribute the source. Yeah. So I can say that is page 4. Or figure 2. What's better? Page or figure number?",
            "Figure number. What -",
            "Figure number is better.",
            "What, what year was the article published?",
            "19.",
            "OK, so then it's creative comments atribution 4.0 international licence.",
            "Yeah. So that just we need to have to cite the source. And I don't know if you have to list the licence.",
            "It's -",
            "Well -",
            "It's an atribution and no additional restrictions so...",
            "But I would, I would still mention the licence.",
            "OK, the thing is one - How many such pictures you would like to have in our book?",
            "So I think major, major all the pictures -",
            "Should be ours.",
            "Yeah, I don't know.",
            "It is - It's -",
            "It looks better.",
            "Because in my, in my, in my chapter I like the matter the, all the, of the figures will be, will be ours. Or I can generate some of pictures from maybe - I, I plan to generate the picture from, from tabels which are in the, in the, in the papers so, so it looks better. But I, I also plan the include one of two, one or two pictures from the, from the other papers. Not much, not many. PERSON8, here's still, there are many subsections with no content.",
            "These two?",
            "Yeah, that's kind of, I don't have more to say I think. I can just -",
            "You don't have any chocolate to, to this boxes.",
            "No. I, I can, I can just say them more detailed since just kind of, nougats. So they, they even no say much more in the original paper actually and I don't know any other papers, on that.",
            "And these? This is the same. Then these -",
            "Maybe there are two more papers about name entities. I don't think there are more papers about grammatical error correction or event fractuality.",
            "But it, it's, it's strange to the -",
            "You two, you two deffinitely say more about event fractuality.",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's true.",
            "Fractuality, yeah.",
            "OK, fair enough.",
            "You at least year.",
            "OK, that's, that is correct. Yeah. So it shou, yeah, I think it will be like one paragraph or something. OK.",
            "Usually at the content at least.",
            "OK. OK. I agree.",
            "It isn't easier to just put other like things?",
            "It's just.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think -",
            "I didn't really know -",
            "That people -",
            "How to -",
            "Like about the experiments.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "In different tasks.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I didn't want to put through it just other but then it's true that I don't know where to prove it like these are syntax but, but the other ones like gender of nouns -",
            "Of I don't know semantics maybe but, I don't know. Yeah, I tried to group them just on through things like syntax or semantics but, often I actually did not very sure. Like name entities. I don't know.",
            "Yeah. I, I have it much easier in the, in the attentions.",
            "Because I only need to group like some connections.",
            "So I group only the presency trees, constituency trees -",
            "And, and, and coreferences.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So...",
            "So, so here - Yeah, in the, in the, in the hidden states or contextual embeddings people look for lot of stuff, yeah.",
            "We still have the picture like the, like PERSON21. Where it is?",
            "Page 15 or 5?",
            "It, it is - Yeah, I don't know why all, all my pictures are at the end of the chapter, there is some problem. Yeah.",
            "This is it.",
            "This one. That I think half of this - Half of this figure is like for attentions and the other half is like for, for probing, isn't it?",
            "No. No, everything here is for attentions.",
            "Everything is for attentions?",
            "Like it's hard but some parts are probing but in transformers. So yeah, it's like, it's like contextual embeddings.",
            "Yeah, so, so yeah. This it's true.",
            "So maybe we should, we should devide this, this -",
            "Into two pictures.",
            "Into two pictures.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because this is, this is, GPT?",
            "Yeah, this is like GPT -",
            "GPT and attentions. There is also hidden one with PROJECT1 -",
            "So it would be also like probing.",
            "The hidden one we cannot see it now.",
            "Yeah, because -",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "It's on the right.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
            "There is on the right. Yeah. I don't how chan, how to change this. This pgf but - Look so far I haven't look in, into it so...",
            "Yeah, I, I think it can be some box that you can because to, to like put it some box -",
            "Defined here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Cause here, you can only put it's on.",
            "It's only included though.",
            "Yeah, they can like part, part it into -",
            "Yeah and there, there are also one problems if these element of, of - Pgf, I don't know, yeah.",
            "Well the problem is that, that, that lighting doesn't want to, do the words through, through Overlap.",
            "Do the, for, for -",
            "So it - Latex just, just for to prevents, the words from overlapping and then, then that's why it does those stuff.",
            "Aha, aha. OK. So if it is not nothing it will be OK. Se we need to regenerate -",
            "Need to regenerate.",
            "We need to regenerate. We need to - Yeah.",
            "Smaller font image.",
            "Smaller font. Yeah. And then transfer it. Yeah, so...",
            "I can do it.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Actually on, only these two, two. Only your, your - Pictures are so fine pgf.",
            "The other some like pdf and I think so I, I need to... Yeah, this is, this is, this is like, this is google docs. It needs to be, to be - Yeah. To be done better. But OK. So in my, my chapter I, still don't have the first part finished. It needs to be rewritten. But the chocolate is already in the box but I need to - Rearrange the chocolates. But it's only the introduction and like the word element I think. And then it should be, it should be more or less written. So from 5.2... Maybe is - Yeah, missing - Maybe I would, I, I - Some, in some parts I would, I could write more but... Yeah and there are some pictures missing.",
            "So if I want to read something I should start, what section? 5.2 and -",
            "5.2.",
            "And go on.",
            "It's - Yeah. Because 5.1 you, you already read it and I haven't change it.",
            "OK.",
            "So, so 5.2 and 5.3. Yeah, the, the pictures will be, will be changed within so the, they, they should be nicer but... 5.2, syntactic function, dependency trees, so yeah. This will written by PERSON21 and I, I have rewritten some, some parts so that it more fits the, the book. It's consequency trees. And yeah, maybe we will, we will remove this table, I don't know.",
            "Yeah, and this is - This I - Yeah. I have rewritten a bit the 5.3 but, is still, there is still missing the last, last part of this and some discussion o, on this part so there is still missing something and the end of this sub, subsection.",
            "And then - Yeah, today morning I wrote or today night I, I wrote this conclusion but yeah, I don't know. So this is more or less written but yeah, some parts still need to be rewritten and, and the pictures may, must be done better. OK. So, PERSON21?",
            "OK. Can I share my screen?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or do I have the pdf of -",
            "Switch it.",
            "Share my screen. Entire screen. OK. Do you see my screen?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes. OK. Do you see the book?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK. Wait a minute. I don't - Single page. OK. So chapter 3, the first - OK. The first part is written I guess and I'm sure that it would, like I'm sure that, it would benefit from further reading and comments and rewritting and so on. The to do section here can be safely deleted. It's just things that can be added but are not essential. Then there is this 3.1 methods for interpreting neural networks and I thought PERSON9 said he would write something.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I said it but I haven't written.",
            "And yeah, then there's this 3.2 which I'm not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it but I think we can decide that at the end.",
            "I think this was, yeah, PERSON8's, PERSON8's, this was PERSON8's thing. So...",
            "This is what PERSON8 moved into my chapter and then I moved, moved it here.",
            "Yeah. I, I promised that I will, I will, I would, I will move fast of my introduction of my chapter to here as well because these, these are, these two texts are very, very similar.",
            "OK. Well, I'm not sure how -",
            "So in, in our plan, it is... Where it is?",
            "Where is our plan? Here? This plan?",
            "No, the -",
            "Yeah, yeah, this one. Yeah.",
            "PERSON9, yeah, this is 3.1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON8 and me. Rewrite and move there something from, from chapter 5.",
            "OK and then there's this chapter which I need to move this. That's also in the to do list. 4.1, 4.2, move. And then... Yeah, I finally managed to train FastText embeddings. And as you can see the bands are actually there. Now what - Now what's strange the FastText image here seems much more, similar to the original Glove image here. It's much more similar than the Glove that I trained. And Word2vec is still just noise so I'm not sure what make of this.",
            "Well, isn, isn't it just because of the colours? Of the colour scale?",
            "No. This is the same colour scheme.",
            "OK. Yeah, but I mean -",
            "These - This, this is different.",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "You can see the, the bands here and the bands here in the FastText's image are similar.",
            "But, but my point is that if you, if you would try to like shift the mean of the Glove colour scale you might end up with the same image as, as they, as they had. They just tried optimized through the, they might it, might it optimised virtual so it's more visible.",
            "So, so basic numbers should be normalized a bit.",
            "Well, I'm not sure what do you mean because -",
            "Like they don't probably have the same, like the same mean, in the different models. So if you just divided them by the mean and all the images.",
            "Nothing happens, right.",
            "Nothing happens. Yeah.",
            "Because the, the scale is automatically adjusted to, to show the whole range.",
            "So...",
            "Yeah, but, but it. What I'm saying they, they, they might have use something lumenier just to, just to look it more visible.",
            "Aha.",
            "I was thinking about that. Well, I'll look into it.",
            "But it's strange that the FastText -",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Shows this structure right away.",
            "Yeah. My was different. I thought maybe some of the embeddings do have some extremes so if you include these extremess then most of it will be squashed. So if you, if you like cut of the top and bottom, 5% maybe it could be different.",
            "Yeah, that's option.",
            "On scale but -",
            "That's what maybe happening in this Glove image but why isn't the same thing happening here?",
            "Or why is it happening here?",
            "And... I don't know. It's strange.",
            "It's possible for Czech, not for English.",
            "Yes. Yes. But FastText shows the structure and the others don't. Strange thing. Anyway, images, images, images, bla, bla, bla. Yeah. I've, written something about debiassing. I wrote a conclusion. So in the end the only things left for the to does is the, is - And then 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 which I'm confident I can do today so... Tonight the chocolates will be in the box. And you can comment on them and then I rewrite the chocolates. And the chapter will be done.",
            "Are you planning to do something about, about the figures?",
            "What?",
            "My figures or figures in general or PERSON21's figures?",
            "PERSON21's figures. For instants 4.1.",
            "Yeah, 4.1. I will either move it to your chapter or delete it.",
            "Right. And tell me what, how does it - Because I think it's, this is the same as my figure... Where is it, where is it? Where is that? 1.9.",
            "Yeah, well... Yeah. It's probably almost the same thing. I don't know. I... One thing is that your figure is quite ugly.",
            "At the other one would, would totally different fonts and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then so it'll be beautiful.",
            "That's true. Also these figures are not completely the same because the original PERSON13 model had some, I'll - How do I get back to the - Here. It has these lines. What do you call them? Dashed lines?",
            "Yeah.",
            "They are some connections directly between embeddings and the soft max layer.",
            "But yeah, also I think this is -",
            "That's line only say that, that you can find the, the probability value for word at depositions it's... It doesn't mean any like computational connection.",
            "And because I thought it was confusing it's not in my figure.",
            "OK. OK. So I think I will delete this figure. Also I think this is a bitmap image so it should be deleted anyway. Yeah. I will delete this figure and I may do something with your figure so...",
            "OK.",
            "Because like... What I don't like here is for example this arrow here.",
            "OK. Well, if I, if I make the, the subsign smaller it will, it will get fixed probably. Because in my disertation it wasn't like this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "With a different fonts.",
            "Also these arrows in general are ugly. But yeah. Other then that I don't need the figure when this figure is here so I delete it.",
            "My part write your text, like 4.2 or 4.3 and then you can, you can make this figure, better.",
            "Yeah. Sure.",
            "By the way this is the very first image I, I made in tix and the code is really terrible. Don't, don't get scared when you, when you open the source.",
            "I've seen. I think I've seen worse. And... Also, yeah... I think - OK. I - This is also ugly.",
            "You are ugly.",
            "Well, I'm but I'm not putting my face into the book. Anyway, yeah, we can leave the ugly figures to the end.",
            "Please, first finish, finish the text.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And figures at least in, in some - Yeah, at these they should be there but they, they might ugly or we, we need to know what is there, what is in the figure.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No if the figure is ugly or not and then -",
            "I, I guess -",
            "You can make the figures, improve the figures.",
            "Yeah, I think we can improve the figures after it's been send to the reviewers right? If we don't change the content of the figures just how they look.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah. It, it is possible to change it after. So if it, if we have it in pdf and not it pgf, it's no problem I think. If only -",
            "Yeah.",
            "If only the font change and the, the, the picture will be same only the nicer and then I'm sure it's OK. So yeah. So first, yeah, the text and is the highest priority.",
            "They, then, then the -",
            "Sure. So yeah. So yeah, the figure 4.1 will be deleted. Any other questions about my figures?",
            "Probably not.",
            "Do I have any other interesting figures? Not really.",
            "Just, just avoid an other font, that's fine.",
            "You will have figures in the missing sections like PCA and ICA.",
            "Yeah, probably. Yeah.",
            "And what about figure 4.6?",
            "4.6?",
            "Which is a bit map?",
            "Yeah, well... Yeah. It is a bit map. Yeah. I think I maybe able to find the source and generate a tix file. Although, I will be -",
            "Is this?",
            "Yes. So I'm sure I can generate a tix file for this big cloud. I will have to rewrite the cropping thing because that's done on the bit map. But yeah. We can leave that after -",
            "In the big cloud will be visible? In the - PERSON21 Well, it will be resible, visible as it is visible now. Maybe it will be visible if it's tix. I mean if I -",
            "Forever to.",
            "Like right now... It's... Like it's almost readable now when it's a bit map so if, if it was text it would be readable. Yeah, I mean I can read it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Even though it's quite ugly at this solution so... Yeah, but OK, I'll, I'll transform this from a bit map into proper text after everything else is done.",
            "And maybe before fixing my arrows.",
            "Well... I don't know. Like this is just one bit map. Do you have a bunch of arrows everywhere.",
            "And, and the same wholes for, for, for, 4.8 which is a bit map too as, as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and 4.9. which will be English.",
            "OK. And 4.9 and that's not my figure. Actually no. This seems to be vector. Cool.",
            "Yeah, but at least you can replot it so it, so it has the same font as the book.",
            "Sorry, what?",
            "You can replot it so it has the same font as a book.",
            "OK. I think about that.",
            "And, and it's truly easy in Inkscape. You just, you just open it in Inkscape as a pdf and save it as a pdf with Latex text labels.",
            "OK. I would have to install Inkscape for that. I guess I that, can do that.",
            "It's one commented a common line.",
            "Oh.",
            "And, and half of giga byte disk space.",
            "Yeah, that - Inkscape. Well, it says only 170 MB that, yeah.",
            "OK, I can do that. After the text is written. And finished.",
            "OK, so please... When you finish your part made the lines in the, in the PROJECT3 schůzky document, green.",
            "So that I know that you, you really have it, the chocolate is reorder in the box.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And so the deadline is today. Today midnight. And yeah, if I don't see the, the green lines and I don't see that it is really done in the comment I will, I will, I don't know. Send you something. Ugly pictures in the -",
            "So do you think you can make it to, today or? More or less?",
            "I think so. I - The only thing missing for me is add PCA and ICA which I can basically copy from other texts.",
            "Yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.",
            "Yeah, sure. But at least it will be there and then move, move 4.1, 4.2, that's also like 0,5 hour at most and then write something about probing I guess. Well, I think I ca, I can manage to do that today.",
            "OK. And then where it is finished. Or whet it's written somehow we should all of us, we should read it all of book and comment it what is missing where and yeah, where are the problems and other things. I was, searching what were the reviewers of the other, of the previous ORGANIZATION4 books.",
            "And I think that it is not as... For example PERSON10 the word of tokens text and trees, the reviewers are PERSON18, PERSON16.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is the last book... PERSON14, Sentiment in Czech. So this is written in English at least. The reviewers PERSON18, PERSON15. So it's really upside LOCATION2. PERSON6, but it was disertation so there would be there his opponent, PERSON18. PERSON18 is everywhere. With like university. Then this PERSON25. So yeah, so they have like the - PERSON27. OK, so these are two, like two, two reviewers on outside. But, but, I think if we have like, like one reviewer from, from LOCATION2, it's OK. So like... Can we - But it, it - I think it's better if we have, when we have the book alm, almost finished, we can, we can ask someone. Or - Do you mean I should, I should ask someone now?",
            "I think -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It would be at least abstract or I don't know if I ask only, OK, we will have a book with about -",
            "160 pages.",
            "And it's about hidden in the layers.",
            "So do we have some kind of abstract at some -",
            "We have the preface. Pre.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which is nice. But it's not abstract.",
            "It's like the questions.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I was also thinking about the preface don't we need like a real introduction that, that all the books have? Like what exactly you will find in the book, how was it structured, how should you read the book...",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that, that's missing. Because we have, yeah, after preface we have a background but this is deeplearning.",
            "Yep.",
            "In the begginings of - Yeah. Yeah, so we definitely should have something like introduction. So I will add it into our to do list. And do we have, conclusion or sum, summary of our book? I think not yet? Have you have something?",
            "Yeah, summary.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's the conclusion from my one you need to move.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know. I, I just -",
            "Yeah, on it.",
            "Wha, what would be the different between like the -",
            "Yeah. Cause we will have like 3, 3 conclusions.",
            "No.",
            "And then, then one sum, summary.",
            "Alright. We are. Yeah.",
            "One of conclus.",
            "I'm not sure if it's, if it's the same? I mean, you can have some conclusions that you draw from, from the book, from, from the research you, you need but the summary of, of the book is somethin else. Book, books often have summaries. And, and they have the summaries in multiple languages so... Sometimes.",
            "Yeah, anyway would we put something different into a book conclusion and into a book summary?",
            "Boo, book, book summary is, is more like, lon, longer abstract usually.",
            "Aha.",
            "But the introduction would be also something like, like what, what is the -",
            "Yeah and I guess -",
            "Book about.",
            "The conclusion of the book would also be something like that. I don't know.",
            "Yeah, it's as a, it's like a paper.",
            "PERSON9 First you write what are you going to present, then you present it and then you -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Write what, what you presented.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But...",
            "PERSON21 brought some books.",
            "What?",
            "That PERSON21 brought some books to, to, to have a look how, how they are structured.",
            "Aha.",
            "And there are no rules, it, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in Czech and something like that.",
            "Yeah, the series said that the summary is obligatory. But I don't think it says more about what should be in the summary or, or so. Yeah, summary in English must be in every Czech book. That's the only rule it says.",
            "Aha.",
            "So we have an English book so there is no rule.",
            "So for example PERSON10 has conclu, concluding tokens and then summary. So lets see what he has in this. What is there? Now lots of tabels, figures... Summary. That was, seems something like abstract.",
            "Yeah, so it's like one page abstract.",
            "Yeah. And concluding tokens...",
            "That's more like future so...",
            "Is inside. OK. Not introduction. Introduction is not there. But this is like related work is included. OK. So let's - We can write the summary which is so kind of abstract and -",
            "And if the book is too short we can the summary in Czech.",
            "Yeah, we can. So how, how long is -",
            "And in German. And in French.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then we can -",
            "To -",
            "We can have a transformer transform the summary into Hindo.",
            "And PERSON10, PERSON10's book is coh, 158 so it's almost the same size of the book.",
            "So are we gonna be like measuring books with - With PERSON10 or what?",
            "So it, yeah. So it, I think it maybe, yeah. It, it is a book. It is not like or something.",
            "OK. So anything else?",
            "Who's book in the series is the longest?",
            "I think longest would be the light lexikons.",
            "Or PERSON14 might be a good candidate.",
            "No, no, no. PERSON1, PERSON12, bla, bla, bla, 274.",
            "PERSON11, 236.",
            "PERSON7, 375.",
            "Wau.",
            "But this is lexikon.",
            "OK.",
            "But other books like PERSON10, 158, PERSON6, 162. Yeah, so wa. So is there any book which is shorter than our? So far? No. PERSON22, 149. But I think we, we'll add some of the, some pictures and will be there. PERSON4, 119.",
            "110.",
            "Yeah, PERSON26, 110. So it is, it is OK. So we, we have to write it somehow and so it's readable, readable and...",
            "Wanted to do for -",
            "Yeah, it's, yeah.",
            "Yeah, they will do all the, all the erros.",
            "Yeah, they are undefined references not reply defined labels. Some defined cit, citations -",
            "Yeah, these are - Yeah, many of these are probably main because I, I don't care so far. Cause first I want to write a text and then I will, then I will solve the -",
            "All these errors.",
            "Well, it's hard not to introduce new errors when I, when there is so much errors that I can see if I'm introducing new errors.",
            "Yeah, I agree.",
            "Yeah, OK. I, I will, I will, I will go through it and, and try to fix that is missing, missing things.",
            "Yeah, so there are some citations that are not in the Zotero format so they're deffinitely will bee always missing.",
            "The thing is from my survey.",
            "Might be.",
            "So -",
            "But I think I rewritten them, all of them.",
            "This is, this is for now.",
            "This is for now? Aha.",
            "But it's -",
            "Yeah, but this is, this is, yeah, this is in the table.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I haven't - Yeah.",
            "PERSON9 This is the, the citation from the table.",
            "PERSON9 So I, I that. OK, so this is the table. So I will, I will comment it althought. Alright.",
            "OK. There is some missing citation which is also something.",
            "OK, so yeah. So maybe we can, we can end this session and, and finish the writing.",
            "And so the next meeting is?",
            "Yeah, next meeting is... The...",
            "In two weeks.",
            "In two weeks. Monday. 13th July. Like -",
            "OK and -",
            "Going to be before, before the PROJECT2 meeting?",
            "After the PROJECT2 meeting it seems.",
            "After?",
            "So yeah. The meeting is plan, planned 12: 30 and currently PROJECT3 is -",
            "OK, so after. After the meeting.",
            "But -",
            "I don't know. Maybe it can be even before. If we want that.",
            "But when will we go to lunch if the meeting is before?",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "Like -",
            "So it should be after.",
            "Yeah, OK, it will be after in our office.",
            "PERSON9 Because here after.",
            "So it's lunch, PROJECT2 meeting, PROJECT3 meeting and ORGANIZATION4 beer.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I think.",
            "So what's time is the meeting?",
            "2 p.m.",
            "2 p.m.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, the document says that, it's true.",
            "OK. I thought you just change the time because of the lunch. So it's still 2 p.m.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's 2 p.m. so that we can go to lunch before the PROJECT2 meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "The PROJECT2 meeting is 12: 30 or?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, as usual. OK, so I will be sending you many slack messages.",
            "If you haven't written everything.",
            "And you would, you would need to read all the book and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we'll see.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I have holiday from Thursday but I think I will do some work even in the holiday.",
            "Yeah, I, I have holiday the next week. So the whole the next week I probably will not do anything.",
            "I also officialy have holiday next week but I will be working.",
            "Just an off topic question. Do you plan to watch the ORGANIZATION1 lectures? During the next week? Or what are your plans at ORGANIZATION4?",
            "Potentially, yeah. Well, PERSON17 -",
            "Yeah, we all -",
            "Suggested something on ORGANIZATION2. And basically -",
            "And no one apply?",
            "He didn't investigate how this really works. But my plan is that if he organised it something that I will join happily.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, me too.",
            "But I did, I didn't check the ORGANIZATION1 website. I, I'm not registered for ORGANIZATION1 anyway and I didn't understand much like how it's really works and I didn't have time to investigate it so I'm just waiting so if somebody else like prepares it for me and says me, sit here and watch this and -",
            "There are, there are prerecorded presentations and a, after there are broadcasted, there are live QA sessions.",
            "This is how the pre, previous presentation looks like. And there are, are tutorials on Sunday.",
            "So the presentation will be, presentation will be separated from the, question and answering sessions so -",
            "So, so the presentations will be broadcasted like prerecorded and then the QA will be live.",
            "Yes.",
            "That make some sense.",
            "OK. If you want to prevent like situations one, one, no one someone's internet connection presentation or something like that.",
            "Yeah. But the, but the presentations they will still be kind of live. So they will be a broadcast. So it won't be like -",
            "Yes.",
            "You can watch it a day before or.",
            "No. Though, though you need to watch it at, at the given time and for each paper there are two time slots.",
            "So like people all over the world can watch it.",
            "Do you have to be registered for the tutorials?",
            "Pfff. I don't know. I'm registered.",
            "And did you, did you have to like select tutorial?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK.",
            "But you can, you can ask questions live on ORGANIZATION6. So perhaps all videos who are registered will get ORGANIZATION6 link and will, will be able to ask questions and, and maybe the others can watch it as well, I don't know.",
            "I'd like to watch the interpretability and analysis tutorial.",
            "Yeah, that's -",
            "It's with PERSON3.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Aha.",
            "It's some day 2 p.m. if I have recall correctly.",
            "It says here 6 a.m. LOCATION1 time. I don't know what that is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is 3 p.m., 3 p.m. our time.",
            "OK. I will be on the train at this time.",
            "Is it necessary to be here in person to watch it or?",
            "In defense we don't know how to links work, yeah, so.",
            "OK.",
            "I think it should work badly if you're here and somebody else also wants to watch the same thing and he's registered which I don't know if, if it will be true.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know how many people are registered actually. I know PERSON17 is registered and PERSON2 is registered and maybe PERSON20 is registered. And I don't know if people can watch if they're not registered. Or unless they're watching someone -",
            "Share the links.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the password or I don't know.",
            "I don't know. I haven't look into it. So I don't know how it works. You know something more? You're registered so you don't care and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Be this like screening here or other.",
            "Yeah. I think that's kind of the plan but, yeah. It definitely at least depends on what other people want to watch.",
            "So I don't know how many paralel sessions there are but I a lot again.",
            "So if, if, if, if PERSON17 is there registered one and the one on what sessions all the time.",
            "It's possible. Like one of could registered as well. But I don't know how we would for it.",
            "Because we, we need to pay for it and if we don't have any, any paper there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So... So anything else or we can, we can end this session and... So see you.",
            "Alright.",

            "So we have here. Again we are recording this for the purposes of minuting. And one of the early sessions is actually already being, or it could be transcribed by an annotator. So the news from me are that, we had session like live workshop dry run at the LOCATION2 on Wednesday and all the presentations went kind of well for the people who could understand OTHER3, because that was run in OTHER3, and people who had to rely on our subtitling were totally lost. So, the, the head of the particle division of the ORGANIZATION1 was at first very angry like not, not allowed to, to everybody, but I was talking to him for more than five minutes, maybe ten minutes in the corridor. And he was expecting that the technology will be already useful for the users and I've confirmed that the technology is now only working technically. And I do realize that it is not usable for, for those who don't speak OTHER3. So we, we knew this beforehand, so the next the planned session with PERSON5 that we have is, we don't have date for that yet. But we will be watching some, for example OTHER6 video, that we are kind of curious about the content, but we don't speak OTHER6. And we would like, so it has to be something that we can ASR, and OTHER6 is the, the best next option, and we will try to rely on the live generated translations into OTHER3, for example, and we will see how bad the translations will be. And we will also diagnose, the flicker, because for, if you don't understand the source language, then you probably prefer longer delay, and less of flicker, but that's something that has to be tested. So if anybody can join us, if anybody does not speak OTHER6, and would you have an idea what we would like to see, what would be an interesting OTHER6 talk, please email us, get in touch and we'll do it as, like joined watching. So that's, that's one piece of news another bit is that the critically required, and as part of the usability for the users, the critical required the video and subtitles or the slides, and subtitles to be on the same screen. And, this is something that we also know about, PERSON10 has created something which is perhaps better than streaming of video, because the standard video players are designed, To play in a continues way. And they don't care about the lag, and if the lag is being groan, then it's too bad for us, but not too bad for the standard video players. So for that reason, PERSON10 created something which at the server side the presenting machine is regularly taking screenshots. And if the screenshots change, then it will, it will send it as an updated picture to the, to the browser, so the client will be, simply displaying the most recent picture. And, this is something that.",
            "Look like, the very solution, right? Taking screenshots.",
            "Sorry?",
            "I was saying that it looks like very like solution, like you know, hitting with hitting it with the hammer.",
            "Yes, but it's, I don't think it's too bad solution, because it's intended for slides, there is usually no, it's, it's not good for videos obviously, there is no way this would work for videos, but it's good for static slides, and the setup that we have on Monday seminars all the time, and. Excuse me. And the, on the, on the Monday seminars the static slides they even, they even hide the, the watch, so there is like clock. So there is no change on the slides for a couple of dozen seconds. And I think that's, that's reasonable solution. So that's, that's, that's the current thing that we have, but we still need to somehow organize the layout to provide subtitles next to either subtitles or the paragraph you next to the slides. So we have one more person who just came, and that's PERSON7, he was, visiting master students so to say, for semester here, and how, he's now going to leave back for LOCATION2 or, yeah LOCATION2. PERSON11, you are in LOCATION2, right?",
            "Yeah, I am here.",
            "Where are you studying?",
            "I am studying at ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Okay, living in LOCATION2 whole time.",
            "Yeah? And what about you, what do you study?",
            "I am studying also computer science.",
            "Um-hum, yeah, nice to meet you.",
            "Thank you, also.",
            "So, so you could meet then him in person, yeah. So, PERSON7 agreed to join us for the surge, depending on his availability he's or his some paper to finish that, like project to finish, to make into paper, and then also help us in whatever is needed, so that the surge documents. Ok. So that was his since, I really have limited time, the last bit is that on Monday at two I'm giving a talk on the Monday seminar. I'll be again inviting people to help, and I was curious, especially about PERSON9, if he was like successful with his exams, and if he could now work on domain adaptation, so that we could feed in computational linguistics language model for, like OTHER3 talk on computational linguistics, and if that would be, if we if we could plug this into the into the current setup. So that's the last bit from me and now I'd like you to do the standard round, everybody saying: \"What you have done.\" Again, I'm reminding you of, of the sheet, please enter your achievements, so as soon as you've accomplished something, add to the line there, otherwise we'll forget who did what, and that's too bad for the bonuses. Ok, so who can start?",
            "Well, if I may start.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "Alright, so I managed to would almost. Into bigger script, so the processing should now be faster.",
            "Um-hum.",
            "And I also looked into, into the pronounce and fluxes. I, I've sent an email to the, about the, what I found, so if anyone could look into it, and say something, it would be great.",
            "I'm, I'll double check. Yeah, well, no one responded. Yeah, okay, so we'll, yeah, it's it's something that goes beyond the time limit that we have now. So the idea is that we need to provide all the forms, so as soon as a word is found in, because your processing all the related materials, if the related materials, if we're focusing on LOCATION3, if the related materials contain one word. Then we need to include this word in the language model in all its forms. And, I dunno know, what is the key part of your question, I would for simplicity assign all the words all these forms of the same word, the same probability. So I would like to, a replacement word, well actually not, I would choose a replacement word and use the corresponding forms of the replacement word. So if the new word is well, \"reference\", such as the reference translation. And so that's feminine known \"reference\", then I would use that list of all LOCATION3 word forms to generate all the forms of this word, so \"reference,\" referenci \",\" referenci \"this is actually boring, so this, this is very few. \"Referencích\", \"referencemi\", all these, all these variants. And I would the pronunciation is something that you easily generate, and the replacement word should be some random feminine noun, again, the similar, ideally with similar declaration pattern. And then you would use the corresponding form. So, \"reference\", \"růže\", \"růžích\", and you would replace it with all these words. Does that make sense?",
            "Yes, it does.",
            "Does it answer your question?",
            "In the email, I was asking about. The technical process, I should process the, the dictionary, because you mentioned some, you mentioned the transcript for using that, but from my findings, I'm not sure if it that's necessary.",
            "Okay, yeah, so yeah, I'll have a look at that. Thank you. So, is there any chance that you would have some files ready for the Monday talk, or not at all if not that's not a problem, either, but there is all of the semesters are starting, so every Monday there will be some more technical talk in OTHER3, mostly in OTHER3 on. Meeting. So as soon as we have some domain adaptation data, we can plug them in, and that would be good. So what is the status? Is there any chance that he would have something for this Monday?",
            "Yeah should, I guess.",
            "Yeah, so please get in touch with PERSON5, I dunno where is PERSON5 today, I forgot to, I haven't seen him in the office. So please get in touch with PERSON5, and make sure that you can feed those files to him, and he can use them.",
            "Okay, I will get in touch with PERSON5.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you. So then maybe PERSON6?",
            "Okay, so I have mostly the work and the, I have it for LOCATION3, but too difficult to modify for OTHER3, so, I, if I received some domain input sentences, then I could search the database, and return a list of a singular sentence states, and some large focus, and it should also work on word level, so if I give it, then it will find a sentences that are like, so it maybe, because I will be in the mountains on the weekend, but I will be back in like Sunday night, so for the Monday, and then I will be able to provide something, but probably either like Monday morning or Sunday late night.",
            "Thank you, so I don't think that ready and used for this Monday, but it will be very good if you synchronize with PERSON9, and if you provided this to PERSON9. PERSON9 would use the files that we like find for the speaker, and as soon as we have the either you or PERSON9, well that doesn't matter who does that. But as soon as we have the talk specific corpus, so which is papers related to what the authors ig going to talk about and all like that. Then if you could search before, search through a huge corpus of the particular language, LOCATION3 or OTHER3 for similar sentences and see how much this corpus expansion can provide us with related other texts, other sentences.",
            "Okay, but like this is not related to this Monday seminar.",
            "Yes, yes, not yet all.",
            "Okay, okay, so it will be best to if we synchronize with PERSON9, you can try, I'm not sure how, it can be like I just.",
            "It depends on the domain, so if you are searching for, the chances zero. But if you are searching for the domain the LOCATION2. That you should get in touch with PERSON9, because PERSON9 some language model data related to my talk on Monday, so it would be great, if you to try to put this to Monday.",
            "Okay and, I have that, they mostly presentation platform and how it could be, I.",
            "Yeah, thank you, okay, so that's from PERSON6 from PERSON6, and then PERSON11.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So that we do the first people who are online, yeah?",
            "So actually, I worked on three different things this week. And the first thing is the visualization, how was it called, real time audio visualization tool on the old realization tool, which is. Which basically I, I implemented I implemented a back end and the front end. The back end is a server in C, which is just reads the has gently reads the microphone signal, and then it sends it over web socket to the client, which is just a JavaScript piece of code that can be included in any webpage even on a remote machine. So that could make it possible to visualize the sound from the microphone the longer we, we have the volume. I also made it so that it colors in different colors, depending on the volume, though, the last problem is that I'm not sure how to stand those thresholds, and I wrote into email to PERSON5 that I could do in like three ways either I could just like. Use like a random value that I think is correct. Or I could just choose a recording from the from the minuting corpus, and I could perhaps, play the recording for myself and see how loud it is, and then see whether the.",
            "ASR.",
            "Threshold.",
            "Yeah, so, for now for now please choose random thresholds. But as soon as we have the evaluation running, we can directly.",
            "Bit ready, yeah.",
            "So you, PERSON5, you have already measured word rate a few times.",
            "Yeah, measured and there were differences.",
            "Yeah, so, but you have the scripts to test the ASR.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So maybe PERSON5 could email.",
            "Yeah, I will email.",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah. So if you if you have the pick, any of their recordings and played at various loudness levels, The level, and as indicated or is calculated by your application, and then sat the threshold, so that they work for this, and if you are running any problem problems just set it to some random value. It's only for indication so far, so we need to like to polish the indicators, and it's not, it's not critical in this development stage. Once it is set up, it will be very useful tool. But it's not blocking anything so set it up someway and we'll see. So maybe if the output could be a little bit more verbose so, that some number, would appear next to the next to the image as well, so that when PERSON5 is observing the session, and he notices that something is too quiet, and or too loud, he could mark down the number, so that he doesn't have to take a screenshot and then.",
            "That's a good idea, yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, thank you, so that's the first thing, visualisation.",
            "And also, also, I worked on the other paraphrasing model.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "Like the many to many machine translation model and I used the cloud OTHER5 to train it, at first, I just used a data set of 300 million open subtitles from various languages. And I'm going to deploy this data, and this trained model today hopefully. It looks like the paraphrases are much better than the previous model.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "The problem is that, the problem is just that, because it was trained with TPU that, there are some other like, ways of how it, how it saves the models. So I just haven't been able to export it so far, so hopefully I will get through this obstacle today. And I also received new data from ORGANIZATION2, and I'm going to get it training today, and hopefully I will have some results, until the end of the weekend.",
            "Yeah, okay, that's great, that's absolutely great news. So as soon as you have the PROJECT5 models, that correctly load on our GPU's, please email.",
            "Yeah, that's the problem that. So the problem is that this wasn't trained on PROJECT5.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "But I had to do it just in, because of the TPU support, so most likely I will have to export it as.",
            "I don't think it's possible to export.",
            "Yeah, well, there is one for actually, that I could use it's called open neural network exchange format. I'm not sure if I'm not sure if they support it, but it could be worth a try.",
            "I don't think, is it? Open neural network.",
            "It's called PROJECT4.",
            "No it's not PROJECT4. It's like, neural network export format, but the critical thing is that you have to know the architecture of the network. And in the architecture.",
            "Yeah, that's the thing, yeah. Yeah, you are right yeah, yeah there is probably, there is probably not a high chance that the architecture PROJECT5 is precisely the same.",
            "Chances are very low to.",
            "Not for the, not for the paraphrasing server, or like for other use cases. I think that they can, it can be safely used if we serving, which is just. So, so.",
            "Well.",
            "So I think that it still be deployed.",
            "Yeah, so that's great news for paraphrasing, like projects, but I don't think there is any way in which we could benefit from that for PROJECT2, because.",
            "Does it have to be in PROJECT5?",
            "No, we are also serving, so that's a good, question. So are we running the LOCATION3 OTHER3 from PROJECT1, or not, because on PROJECT1, there is TensorFlow serving behind the scenes. So the OTHER3 LOCATION3 model is on OTHER1 serving, but I'm afraid that we are running PROJECT5 models. So we are running PROJECT5 models, which are trained in a similar way, but still well, PROJECT5, PROJECT5 only and not OTHER1 serving. So we don't have, the connection to the integration of OTHER1 models, do we? I don't think if any. So we can we can ask, but perhaps it's it's they really good to evaluate this, like offline.",
            "Yeah definitely, so that we don't burn time.",
            "Yeah, and see if we, so that's a thing for PERSON5 again, as we are growing, we still have not collect, obtained any single number from our models, in the in as they are in this setup, but we should get to that in the two weeks of February at the latest, so within these two weeks. We would know, how will these models, our models perform, and you should apply those models also on the same data, and we will see how big improvement, we can get.",
            "If you could just send me, just some data set or a link, or just if it's new stats what it is. So i can just run it.",
            "Sources, OTHER3 sources, and you will provide all the target languages that you can. PERSON11, right?",
            "Sorry.",
            "It's OTHER3 in to many.",
            "No, it's many to many actually.",
            "Many to many, yeah, so we are mostly.",
            "But it is, but it is trained like in OTHER3 centric way, and when I evaluated it on OTHER3, it has much better performance than in the other languages obviously, because it sees OTHER3 all the time.",
            "Yeah, that's the paraphrasing, but for PROJECT2 purposes, simply the send all the various recordings that we have already transcribed, and we don't have translation for that, so we need to polish the data set, but just for. Let's just give it a try. So the best corpus is actually the best file in the file which you have also translated into OTHER2. The one word they are talking about the cat and drawing the animals. So that one please. Yeah, yeah, so we will send you something.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you. And you mentioned the third thing.",
            "Oh yeah, the third thing was the paraphrasing server itself, so.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it is running, but the other results aren't satisfactory.",
            "Yeah, okay, great, that's running when we won't need it. Okay, thank you, great. Perfect, so that was PERSON11, and then there is nobody else on the remote call, so maybe PERSON8.",
            "This week i worked on data collection, is basically four five languages, five languages so almost all the languages have finished, but some remaining. So I think I will finish in this week. And I will see all the parts with you and your and PROJECT2 folder, I will copy all the files.",
            "That's actually something which would be worthwhile if PERSON11 could translate all these languages into OTHER3, and OTHER3.",
            "Which language is it again?",
            "So, it's the it's the big ones, OTHER3, OTHER6, OTHER2, OTHER4 and.",
            "Yeah, so I would just make a model where I would throw away the lower source languages, and I would just use the main ones.",
            "And why would create a special model? Because you think.",
            "No, no, sorry I didn't.",
            "So PERSON8 is collecting monolingual data, and that means that we need to translate this to create synthetic parallel data.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, this is something that we want to like bootstrap so what we'll do of that. And if you have now these models, if you believe these models.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Are better than the old ORGANIZATION2 one, I'm not believe that as well, then this is the good model to do the offline translations of all these large data.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely.",
            "The languages can be used.",
            "Is it parallel?",
            "No, right now it isn't modeling some documents available on parallel.",
            "But we've we've agreed that the parallel data extraction will be done by ORGANIZATION2.",
            "ORGANIZATION2, yes, I already mentioned the.",
            "So just like leave those parallel files for them and let's use this single, the single side of those for the for the back translation. So please PERSON8 send the path, PERSON11 has access to the to the clusters and PERSON11 can run all the competition. So please send the path to all the source files that you have to PERSON11 and PERSON11 will apply the models, and we will get the first follow synthetic, very much in domain corpus, across these six main languages, and then redo this also with all the other 30 something languages.",
            "Um-hum, okay.",
            "Yeah, great that's that's good thing. So that would ideally happened during the next week, and we'll see how then like what the data look like. And then we should try creating PROJECT5 model on all this translation. Yeah, okay, that's good.",
            "Okay.",
            "Great, so that's it. So now PERSON7, I don't know if you have anything.",
            "Just let you know, I'm just going back next week, I work part time, so that's the reason I just had limited time for this project, and most of my tasks are translations from OTHER3 to OTHER2 to feed anything. If I have additional time, I will look at this.",
            "Yeah, yeah, thank you. And then PERSON5.",
            "Hi everyone, so I'll just make it quick how much this week, so I spend most of the time like preparing for the dry run and ORGANIZATION1 event which was yesterday. And we also worked on implementing the segmenter worker on and I am freezing some issues. The, and I'm not able to run the script basically to deploy their worker on the mediator, and the installation was succesful, so this is like few our tasks, which I concerned. PERSON12 helped me integrating buffer in the LOCATION3 segmenter. So we have now more segmented LOCATION3 text. So that's all from me.",
            "So increasingly.",
            "But how her like I observed that when you give the complete ASR output like at once segmenter, it gives a very impressive segments in the text. But when it isn't ASR text keeps on coming, the segments are less, very less.",
            "So is there a way in which you could train it so that it is more similar to the ASR output.",
            "So that's why how PERSON12 helped me, buffer, I will be taking all the text and so that we like, all incoming text will.",
            "Watch out it must not slow down too much.",
            "Yeah, exactly, so we are yet to.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So basically the whole incoming text will to keep on increasing entrance full context and it will help the segmenter making more segments basically, so.",
            "Yeah, okay, so that's the buffer must not grow too big.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And another question, for what you are training on, because if you are training on correct text, and that's the case, then there is like a domain mismatch of looked again, and a few sentences that PERSON2 was like saying in his LOCATION3 presentation. And naturally, he is a repeating phrases it's jumping out of the sentence, and then and then coming back to the sentence and this is some, this is a second output which we cannot handle.",
            "I was reading newspaper, and I came across that they trained Estonian data set, and they also used some in domain Estonian data and all select auto domain.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So they mixed both of them, train the, so I am probably looking for this contact, maybe PERSON6 to get me some LOCATION3 in domain data.",
            "So that's a good question for PERSON6, what data set has the correct transcripts which are as this fluent as the natural speech.",
            "Yeah. And so select, these sentences should be in like connected to the conversations.",
            "Yeah, that's also another, yeah, conversation. I don't know what is more important. The fact that the PERSON6 sentences are on the same topic or whether the sentences are as the influent as in normal speech. I don't know what is more important.",
            "What the combinations should be okay, it should definitely be in domain data.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON6, do you have anything, any idea what data set could we use?",
            "I'm sorry, there was some buffering, do you mean data for like LOCATION3 conversations talk?",
            "No, I mean data LOCATION3 segment, domain data. Like LOCATION3 and.",
            "LOCATION3 domain data.",
            "Yeah. I'll probably send you an email so that.",
            "Okay, okay, yeah, that would be better I think. We can get in touch and definitely I can like, try to help you with that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I have a quick idea, could we perhaps make just something like, Wikipedia page, or something like that with at least all possible data sets or all possible like you know purposes, so that so that when someone like has a new one, we can always just add it there, so it can be used by everyone else.",
            "I didn't quite understand.",
            "He proposes some Wiki page of all the data that we are using, or we plan to use.",
            "Oh.",
            "Is that right, for PROJECT2 only?",
            "Yeah, for PROJECT2 only.",
            "So the our data ambassador is PERSON2, who is on vacation this week. And I'm not sure if he is coming this week. But he would be the person to, to organize this, and he knows the most. So just please hold on, and we are kind of what you want.",
            "Yeah, okay, okay, because like I, I also have some processed data that I collected, and so, so I could send it somewhere and so on.",
            "Uh-hum.",
            "You wouldn't believe how much work it is to convert it to, to record.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Terrible,",
            "Other data and know about them, work for PERSON2. Okay, so I'll have to run just now. So, thank you very much for coming, next I'll email everybody again, at the latest on Wednesday, when are we meeting next week, and there is Doodle, so please keep that Doodle, like up to date because the Doodle applies to regular weekly time, and we will find the date, which time which suits most of you. Okay, thanks a lot.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you, and I disconnect.",
            "Bye."

            "Next two Tuesdays are fine.",
            "Yeah. Next two Tuesdays there will be meetings.",
            "Alright. At eleven, as usual?",
            "At eleven as usual. Yeah.",
            "Alright.",
            "OK.",
            "And then, there will be - So, the third, the next week of, of - So, the first week of July there is no meeting or?",
            "The first week, the second -",
            "The second?",
            "The second -",
            "From sixth to tenth of July.",
            "Because -",
            "So thirtieth we do have a meeting.",
            "Thirtieth we will do have a meeting and the next week I am not here.",
            "Aha. And then thirteenth.",
            "And then thirteenth, yeah. So, we will have, the meetings twenty-twenty-three and thirty -",
            "And then thirty.",
            "Thirty, and then thirty.",
            "So, if it is a three, there is a meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Not, but not, not on the third.",
            "It's not on the third of July. But other - all other threes are meetings. So -",
            "And then we don't know yet.",
            "I'm not sure whether I'll be here - Yeah, you are - Yeah, you are going to.",
            "But yeah. Then, then on thirteenth I'll be back.",
            "Or you can always join like PERSON7.",
            "Yeah.",
            "If you at least somewhere online.",
            "Yeah. Because - Yeah. Because for example the first or the second, second week I am not -",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "I am not - I will be offline to.",
            "OK.",
            "So, so I think -",
            "OK. Thirteenth. Thirteenth.",
            "OK. So. OK, so we should set on, set, set new plan. So, I, I - So, PERSON7, you, you plan to submit a paper to calling. So, you have some work, so -",
            "I, I thought I would submit something but, but, but probably not.",
            "OK. So - Yeah.",
            "So there is calling deadline but nobody submits anything.",
            "It seems like that.",
            "Yeah. I don't have nothing so, I should, I could submit, so.",
            "Well, it, it, it doesn't, does not depend entirely on me but I think the results is that, that we have now won't lead into something publishable in two weeks. So, we'll probably not submitting anything.",
            "OK. So, I suggest, we finish the writing and the end of the June. Or we have written it in some good shape. And - And we will see. And we will have the meeting in the middle of June then. So -",
            "July.",
            "July, July. July.",
            "I think we need to s, or, or wh, what, what's actually the d-d-dead, deadline for? I think we need several deadlines. One deadline for stopping adding new content, then second deadline for stopping adding comments to others' content and the third deadline for having all the comments at rest or deleted.",
            "So the first deadline the end of June would be stopping adding any contents, new contents.",
            "Alright.",
            "Yeah, we, we can go then through the, through the, through the book and, and, everybody can say, what, what, what contents are still needed there. Like new contents. And that we should go through everything, everybody and, comment everything. So, this can be, discussed in the, in the middle of the July. And yeah, then we will s, because, because. Yeah. The official deadline for, for the book was the end of June but I think now that it's - We will not make it so. But I, I think that it can be postponed, like the, the - All the outcomes of this grant can be post, postponed from, from the end of December to the end of January. So, we have one month more.",
            "Because of the corona crisis or?",
            "Not because of corona crisis but I, I can ask when I, when I sell the, the - The final report. I can ask, to postpone like the, all the outcomes, all the, the, the check of out our outcomes -",
            "Alright.",
            "The end of January. So, I don't know how long, will take, the, the reviews and all the, all the things which I planned for half of ye, half of year. After the submission. Maybe it will be faster, maybe not. But, anyway, I would like to submit it like officially the end of July. Because I don't know whether it can be postponed many more. Maybe it can but I, I, I don't like to like postpone it much because anyway if we postpone it we will not write so -",
            "Sure.",
            "So the first deadline. So, I can write it somewhere. So, June, June thirty, stop -",
            "Actually it says here that we say I don't know whether we have to prove it somehow or whatever that we weren't able to -",
            "Yeah, I know. Alright.",
            "Continue according to plan we could move it for six months but -",
            "Yeah. This is, this is including the fin, financing like including the money.",
            "So for some conferences that happen in the first half of 2021 we could still use the money from the project?",
            "Maybe it's possible. But I don't know when -",
            "Yeah, we could definitely say that we were not able to attend conferences because they were cancelled.",
            "Yeah, we can say it. But I don't know whether we can say we cannot, we couldn't write the book.",
            "Well we couldn't have meetings essential.",
            "Yeah, but - Yeah, but you know.",
            "I know. I don't know how they - I don't know how they assess that. Yeah. You can ask.",
            "I, I can ask.",
            "I we have leftover money so it would be away but -",
            "Then again it would be better not to ask too early because then we would postpone the deadlines and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Not do anything for six more months.",
            "So maybe ask in August or something.",
            "Yeah, I will ask when it's really critical.",
            "But anyway thi. You can for - You didn't, without the corona crisis than we could, we could postpone it like, to the 31st, 31st of January like. So - But with, without the financing so all the finances must be spend, so we have to pay for the, we would have to pay for book, like this year. But I don't know how to - I will ask PERSON10, he -",
            "She, she will, she will know it.",
            "Yeah, but if we ask for the Covid nineteen postpone then we could use the money.",
            "Yeah, we can use it later. Yeah. But I don't know - yeah. But I -",
            "It makes sense to maybe like for the book we don't need to shift it really. So, for the book we shouldn't ask for the extension but for the conferences it would make sense to, to use it for some conferences next year.",
            "Yeah, but anyway I think we will - If we can, if we will spend somehow mon, the money this, this year. We will not need to like to postpone it. The spending. And if we have some new publication next year, I think we will get some money from other sources so.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah, I will, I will ask. PERSON10, PERSON10, PERSON10 told me that she will study it and she will -",
            "Let me know.",
            "Who is PERSON10, by the way?",
            "PERSON10.",
            "Aha.",
            "Like the ORGANIZATION4, ORGANIZATION4 and GAUP lady. For, for, in ORGANIZATION5.",
            "Alright. This is the lady that, that, that sits it, it PERSON12's room and nobody know who she, who, who she is? Oh. Or, or a demon.",
            "And she is moving to LOCATION1. Or at least for a couple of days per week.",
            "Partial only.",
            "I think we will - Yeah. What we have promised, all that papers there's promised we will, we should have at the end of the, the end of this, this year. So, we will not have any problems with, with this. Only thing is the book and, we have to spend all the money somehow. But I think we will make it somehow. OK, so the deadlines. June thirty - stop adding new contents and... So, the, the next meeting would be July, oh, no, no, no - no, July thirteenth. PERSON7, what was the next step? Stop adding -",
            "Stop a, stop adding comments.",
            "Comments. And do you think we, we will manage it in thr, in thirteen days?",
            "Oh, why not?",
            "If we are on holidays?",
            "Comments or comment. And. Thirtyfirst... Book finished. That's it. OK. So now maybe we can, we can go, each of us can say what was done the last week and what, what is plan to do the next, next week. So, I, maybe I can start. I was working on, I'm still working on the attention, attention metrices and different patterns. PERSON3 send me the, the visualisations of the PROJECT9 metrices and types for the PROJECT9 and I, I also know that if I, if - Because I generated the, the metrices from the, PROJECT1 -",
            "Machine translation and the, like the heat maps were, were very sharp but I know if someone else generates something very similar the heat maps are - Don't need to be as sharp as, as, of neural setting. So now I, I'm, I, I don't know whether to. Because it was some, it was some. If I don't know what, in what it was but if you set something differently, some parameter of, of the neural machine translation training then the heat maps -",
            "Are that very, very different. So, what we observed with PERSON9 in our balustrades paper, these were very, very sharp. So, the balustrades are really very sharp but. If, if, maybe the settings is, different, the, the balustrades are very, very, how to say it, not sharp. And we, we even got almost the same blue score.",
            "And, and I think it was trained on the same, same data set as you used. It was, it was English to German translation what you work with. Wasn't it?",
            "Yeah.",
            "So.",
            "So you think it's - Because what, what I, observed in LOCATION2 but they didn't use, they use, like, PROJECT8, I think.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we, we was changing the parameters and finally we, we get the same, like the similar balustrades as, as, with PROJECT1.",
            "But I know that there are many other settings that they're completely different, different balustrade but not, not balustrades but they are really, the balustrades are not as, not as visible as in our settings there. So, so, now I don't know because in my chapter I just, I'm comparing the, PROJECT8, PROJECT8 -",
            "Visu, PROJECT8 heat maps and PROJECT9 heat maps and I know that some PROJECT8 heat maps are completely different from balustrades.",
            "So I, I, I don't know whether to, how to, how to write about it in a, in the text because I know that they are, very different. Maybe I will -",
            "Yeah. I'm, I'm not aware of, of any like major difference that, that might cause that.",
            "I, I, I, I know that it was one parameter I don't know, I don't know which one but it was like layer something, not layer normalization, not was, something similar but, yeah. So, I, I don't know whether to, whether to only write OK. We tested this thing of, neural machine translation and we tested bad and beside the, beside the outcomes or try more param, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and - But it will be much more and more complicated how to, how to say something about that so.",
            "Well, you can just add a footnote commenting that, that, it, it might be an artifact of PROJECT1 because, because one the heat maps look slightly different. So, I don't know.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it mostly comes from like concentration of the distribution because in PROJECT9, PROJECT9 also something like balustrades so this like straight lines but still the distribution is not so focused -",
            "It's not, not so focused, yeah. Yeah.",
            "It was. It was. Yeah. There are also something like balustrades but as - Yeah. Not as -",
            "Also I think colors really negative sometimes. Yeah. Cause I used like blue on white, u, you like bright - On black then I see those -",
            "Yeah, but I -",
            "I have also the blue or white or something -",
            "OK.",
            "Or white. It was, it was really different. But yeah. I, I will somehow - So that way I, I spent a lot of time on that chapter and on that section and I still have not finish it. Because - Yeah. So, OK. So, that was what I, I was working at last week. Only and - Yeah, I would like to, so I, maybe I will, I will go through my chapter and go, say what is needed to be, to be - What are the new content this, that are needed to be, added. Right is, this is PROJECT5, this is PERSON9's PROJECT5. Oh, no, no, no.",
            "This is PERSON9's PROJECT5 copied in the, in the.",
            "This is - Yeah. Conclusion. Why there is no table of contents in this, viewer?",
            "I can download it and open it in something else.",
            "You can. OK. So, the first part of, section, of chapter five must be reviewed. I have many, still many PERSON7's comments there - And it should be rewritten because, there are some things that are, that should not be there and maybe, yeah, should be, that should be changed. Then, so it, these other things about, about the, the, like attentions, the cross-lingual attention, and the start of attentions. Then I have, the section about self-attentions and - So, this is the categorization, it is almost done. Only, I would like to, I would like to add, add the figures and I'd like to add some, conclusions and some, tables about, about proportions on different attentions, att, attentions patterns.",
            "Then I have a section about highly, about the written that attention heads that mainly the paper from, of PERSON14 et al. and PERSON13 et al. So, this is almost finished. Then there will be, syntactic specific functions in attention heads. This will be written mainly by PERSON3 and he already -",
            "Has something for his paper. So, he, he will share it somehow. Or he will share it, copy it to here. And also, the inference of syntactic.",
            "And, and then there should be the section about the interpretability, whether it is really inter, interpretable, or not, the attentions. And this is almost - Right, the contents are there almost but it must be rewritten and I don't know what, how much details to give there because I have some tables there but they maybe, maybe they are not needed. Maybe I will shorten it because there are many details about, about the s, about the papers.",
            "Would say the less details the better.",
            "Sorry?",
            "The less details the better.",
            "You would say -",
            "Yeah. If you, if you can concentrate the main message without, without the details that, that's what we need.",
            "Yeah. It is - Yeah. It really went better. So. Yeah. I took it to, yeah. There are many, many details at - Yeah, maybe it, it, it's better - Because anyway now the, now the, the book now is one hundred and thirty pages something. And we still don't have anything - We still don't have - Not anything. Everything, so. So, I think it's better we don't write it like one hundred fifty-eight, right, it's OK for a book. So and I don't know how much content is still missing for the other chapters but, I think for my chapter it's now twenty pages long and I think it will have maybe a bit more but not much. OK, so let's, let's go to PERSON11. Yeah, PERSON11, can you go? Yeah.",
            "I've written a few paragraphs. It's the most I've written since I started, till this week. So, I don't know, the last week rather. And I think it's almost ready to be read. But not quite. Anyway -",
            "And trying to write as much as possible without it necessarily making much sense - S, so that I have something that somebody can comment, and we can work on it. Because otherwise I would be crafting perfect paragraphs, at the, no, at the parade of maybe one a week, maybe one in two weeks and that's unusable. So, this is also unusable, but you can comment on it and we'll see you where that leads. Anyway during working on this I, I came to the conclusion that this chapter really, the, the old idea of having a story is not really doable for me because I don't know that much of the history and I would have to spend another half a year reading things. So, I think I would concentrate on visualisations of embeddings and comparing visualisations of different embeddings inside that because all the papers there's always this interesting visualisation but then not, no other paper does the same thing. For example, there's the, there are the bands in the Glove, Glove vectors and they say that the same structure can, is, that can be seen in, in other similar vectors as well. But I haven't seen it done for Word2vec, anything so - Also, that can be like the one of the contributions of this book that I will -",
            "It shouldn't be too difficult.",
            "I didn't understand.",
            "That it shouldn't be too difficult to redo visualisations.",
            "Yeah. It will not be difficult, and they will take up a lot of space so -",
            "Alright.",
            "So I think that's a way to go. And also, I don't think I will be writing very much about, the generative, the new generative language models because like they are based on sub-words and the embeddings are not interesting anymore. And I haven't seen any papers concerned with embeddings in these models because it's more interesting to look into the attention heads and things like that. So, I think if we are to speak about these models which I don't think we have to because they are so recent then we can just -",
            "Say that you know. They came up while we were writing the book and, yeah, we can just ignore them, or you could put them in one your chapters possibly. But I think I'll just mention them and, and won't really go into it. So that's, I'm the - the, the, the, the - That's the overview of where my chapter is going, and I have a few questions about data, but I think it will be easier to - If I just write them on Slack and we will discuss it there because I have to run anyway.",
            "OK, so - Yeah. So, what, what content is missing or?",
            "What content is missing? Well, I think I - Up to component analysis it's almost there but, yeah, OK. Maybe don't... Four point three is more or less commentable. Four point three, one and four point three, two still need some work. Four point four, that's, mostly copied from elsewhere and I need to go for it once again and then four point five will be just a note so it will disappear. Then I want to write something on debiasing and the summary and that's it.",
            "And I ment - And then like lot of the visualisation that I want to do are missing and that's why I want to talk about the data and what data should I do the visualisations on but I think it will be better to let that discussion to ORGANIZATION7. OK.",
            "It, it, it seems to me that there is a quite a big overleap or, I forgot what, what, what, what is, was. With, with section two point one that I, that I've written. That explains how Word2vec is trained but it should be fine, I guess.",
            "I, I, I will, I will look into that and possibly delete some of mine -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Chapter and just, you know cite your chapter.",
            "OK. By the way it was chapter four. Is anyone, does anyone feel responsible for chapter three?",
            "I do. I will write it someday.",
            "Alright.",
            "So what's there? Hidden states.",
            "I mean if, if chapter three is, an interpretation. Yeah.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, it's -",
            "Yeah. So, I'm planning to go through at least the first two, articles mentioned in the three, zero, one.",
            "And include what's mentioned in three, zero, two and then rewrite it to, yeah, to make sense.",
            "You know how to, how to do zero, zero section?",
            "Yeah. If you don't put section, you just put subsection then it's in the zero section.",
            "Aha. Aha.",
            "Yeah, but -",
            "So I cannot make ze, zero, three, zero, zero.",
            "These sections will not be there because they're just to-do lists.",
            "OK.",
            "Oh, you probably really can you if you set manually the section counter to minus one and, and then at the section it, it will probably get zero.",
            "OK. Good to know.",
            "And then you can always you know, it's just Tex. So, you can redefined the numbers and... Or you can just write the macro that rewrites everyone to zero and, and...",
            "Then it will be fun to read.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah. Anyway, I have to run so...",
            "OK.",
            "Sorry about that and -",
            "So - So PERSON9?",
            "Yeah, so I can, I can share my screen so that -",
            "Yeah, it will be better.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So -",
            "So if you, if you switch to ORGANIZATION1, do you see now my screen? Yeah, thanks. OK. So, so I, I'm restruct, restructured the section so now what should be definitely readable is like the structure. So, the things that are there should stay where they are, already and I, I need to add more, things somewhere. So for the introduction -",
            "Bye.",
            "PERSON9, by the struc. By the structure you mean, you mean the titles of the sections and subsections, alright?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Titles of sections and basically the things that are there mostly should stay there or be made shorter maybe or rewritten a bit but kind of the contents that's there should be mostly there.",
            "And there is some things missing which are not there yet. So, the -",
            "Alright.",
            "Introduction, I have to change the whole thing basically because it's just some left over stuff from the previous introduction which rely it on some stuff that we moved to other chapters, so it doesn't make much sense now. So I plan to change it but generally the introduction should say that, yeah. We have these hidden states and these contextual embeddings and they're kind of the same thing. So, we will talk about them and, and what's hidden in them. And so, then, the main thing is the section six point two. So this should be kind of the main contents of the chapter should be this, this section. So the plan is that it should contain, it should be partitioned to, to several subsections mostly the ones that are there already, probably. So somewhere I just need to say that OK there are these different models, and some are better than other, and some capture more syntax than other and so on. So, either at the beginning or at the end of the section.",
            "By the way \"Who is better\", is, is, is a very bad title of the section.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Probably the title should be rewrittened. So, but the contents - it's generally what should be there just written more nicely.",
            "And then, I, it went to go over the individual linguistic abstractions and see how they are captured. So, I should probably begin with morphology and right now there are some parts moved from other parts of the text so it's not very coherent - But in general, this is what should be there and, there are some more works that are not there yet which I plan to add. But these ones they should probably there, in some form. Yeah, as we said so now it's structured according to the individual papers, so this paper found this, this paper found that. This is something we want to change so I plan to, just say what's true and then just say who found it. So, so to kind of look at it the other way around. But it's basically just reorganizing the information that's already there. And for syntax, I definitely need to add something more but there is already quite a lot of syntax, actually. How do I make it some reasonable size? So, yeah, it's a same thing so it's, it's, things from different parts of the chapter now moved together to one syntax section and - Yeah, I think I'm missing still some of the key, papers that find syntax in there. And I had some, some to-do lists, later but, this is what I plan to. So I plan to add something more and I plan to kind of shorten actually the things that are here, and again restructure it. So that is says what is there, not, not the structure of the papers. And then the rest i, it's - Yeah, I'm not really sure about the division here so I have a section which is now called \"Semantics\", and I'm really not absolutely sure which things belong into semantics. So I have some things there which I found, which I believe are semantics, but I would be happy to take some suggestions, like. OK, this is not really the semantics, this is something else, I don't know. And it's possible that I'm still missing some papers which also look at some semantic stuff. I don't know if I have the semantic roles there. I think so, but I can't see it now. Yeah, yeah. Something is there, maybe there is something missing as well.",
            "Did you write this or? I, I see only word senses and -",
            "Yeah, this is the - OK. Yeah. You have the PERSON7's face there, so you don't see the -",
            "Aha.",
            "The - the, caption of the section.",
            "OK, I don't know. Sorry.",
            "Yeah, I scrolled down. So, this thing, yeah. So, I don't know for example there is, work on noun gender -",
            "Noun gender is probably lexical semantics. Winograd's schemas are probably pragmatics or maybe event what linguists call discourse. I'm not sure.",
            "But the paper I read talk about it as semantics, but I don't know.",
            "Yeah, but, but coreference resolution is, is part of the discourse theory in LOCATION3.",
            "Yeah, well the, the point was that to result the coreference in the Winograd test you really need and actually to understand the meaning of the words kind of -",
            "Yeah.",
            "So in this they said it text semantics even though the task itself is probably not semantic. Yeah, I, I'm, I was thinking whether to really try to say which is semantics or whether to have multiple smaller subsections and just say coreference and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I, I, I would say it's much better. Like, at least.",
            "It's probably safer.",
            "It's safer -",
            "Because, yeah. Somebody cannot like it.",
            "Yeah, someone would say, oh, this is not semantics, this is something else.",
            "I think you know cause -",
            "Yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's hard to.",
            "Everyone is but at least it's safer.",
            "Yeah, it's safer.",
            "I, I have a discussion with PERSON3 whether part of speech tags are syntax or morphology.",
            "Oh.",
            "So it's -",
            "Yeah. So, so the same could be done for syntax but I'm just saying syntax but there is constituents in syntax, the, the labels, the structure. Again dependencies whether it's the structure or the labels or just distances in the trees so I could split it into multiple smaller sections.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because now it's just one huge section anyway, so -",
            "Yeah. I think - Yeah. It, it - Because anyway that, that would be like three sections like only morphology -",
            "Syntax, semantics. So, it, it's better, if, if you can, you -",
            "Yeah. OK. So then yeah. So, I, I'll re-split it, it work.",
            "Any, anyone know what are the, the smaller, the smaller sections so -",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "I think it could be better for, for reading.",
            "Yeah.",
            "As well.",
            "So I now have some break senses and I forgot what's the paper's drew. Oh, yeah, so, these policy must works. So, again now I would say, yeah. But keep it as a separate subsection.",
            "Just it's typic problem. And that's all for the, the, the abstractions that people look for, kind of. Or at least what I have covered now. Maybe I'll find something else which will get its own subsection but. More or less this, this is what I think will be there and, then there a few more. So, one is which is in which layers. I don't want. So that's, again a different view so that I don't know. Morphology is usually the first layers and then syntax is the deep layer, deeper layers or and so on. So, right now it's a, a lot of, paragraphs, small paragraphs moved from elsewhere, so I should get a bigger picture on that and put it here. Then there is another thing, where they look at, to a which, the, the context section. So, the question is whether it really, captures some abstractions or whether it only captures word identity plus context, which is an interesting question. And it seems, yeah, to some extent it's just the context but to some extent it does do some high-level abstractions really. So, I found it interesting, so I think we should have a section on that.",
            "It doesn't really fit to the linguistic abstractions, before so I moved it here now. And then. Yeah, then the last thing I really have is the effect of pre-training task. This probably should be larger and now I have just one work and there is definitely more works that looked OK, you should re-training for language modelling usually. But maybe something else for different usage so, I haven't read much about that so, but I think it belongs - I don't know, I think it belongs here because I mean like the effect on what the representations capture after that... Yeah, so I think this should be like maybe two pages, now it's one paragraph.",
            "I don't know.",
            "I have some visuali, visualisation but -",
            "Aha? So, yeah, so I think whenever you have something that fits into something here, feel free to put it there -",
            "Cause it's a mess anyway, so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "You won't make it worse definitely and hopefully - You will make it better. And, then, yeah, there is some list of papers that I want to cover, and I have not covered yet, mostly. Maybe I won't cover all of them but, maybe some are missing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, yeah.",
            "So all these sections will be cancelled? You a, all -",
            "Yeah, yeah. This is just like to-do -",
            "So now o, only like papers that.",
            "Mention to-do list. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, yeah, that fit some of the previous, sections.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. And something we found still missing is multilinguality. I think we talked about it last time.",
            "It - We want to cover it's somehow, somewhere and I really haven't written anything about it and I don't even know if it should fit into this chapter or if it should be a separate chapter and I don't know what we actually want to write about it. So, we only know this from PERSON7 that we want to put the, the multilinguality paper that we submitted to -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Where did we submit it? I don't know. It's -",
            "The PROJECT4.",
            "PROJECT4.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So, so we want to report on it somewhere.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, I don't have actually any specific plans on that.",
            "You, we would like to report also that the, some information from the PROJECT12 paper you submitted.",
            "From this one. Maybe.",
            "But definitely that you, yeah.",
            "It should be there.",
            "So, so I don't know if, if anybody, wants to take over this section, I, I would be glad but. I don't know if PERSON7 can do this or?",
            "Probably not, I don't know.",
            "I don't even know if we want to put it into this chapter cause, in some way -",
            "I think we - I think we do because it's about, it's about the hidden states of multilingual PROJECT9.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's right.",
            "It's - Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know. But.",
            "I don't know either. I can ask. I can ask PERSON5 and I will write him like the official -",
            "Whether we can like for example copy the sections -",
            "If it is OK.",
            "We, we just -",
            "Yeah. First, yeah. We should, we should have some abstract.",
            "Yeah, maybe we can leave out the technical details.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And put there the nice thing.",
            "But anyway -",
            "Nice images and some -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's for the, it, the part of the introduction -",
            "We could, we could copy.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And like the related work from the paper is actually what we kind of want to put here anyway cause -",
            "That's, that's what want to have here like not only the other paper but also other works.",
            "That's basically what we did for the related work in that paper. I don't know if it matters.",
            "I can a, I can ask.",
            "PERSON5.",
            "Yeah, th, that's right. But that, that's the dissertation. It's something else than, than the regular papers but anything, anyway I shouldn't not, no problem.",
            "But I can ask.",
            "Yeah. And I guess, yeah, that's it, so I think we just remove the sentence level representations we decide nobody wants it.",
            "So, yeah, I guess that, that's for me. So... So, it's now in a stage where it should be reasonably easy to, to add the missing information there and, and organize it into a readable way and, yeah.",
            "So, please, first organize the, the, the sections so that I can, I can send it to PERSON5.",
            "Add these to table of contents -",
            "At least it looks somehow reasonable.",
            "And, yeah. I would like to send it maybe on Thursday, so.",
            "Tomorrow is the PROJECT6 -",
            "Day.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah.",
            "How, how prioritize that.",
            "OK, great. So, maybe, maybe PERSON3 can say what, what he's, what he's, what is he doing, so that PERSON7 know.",
            "Yeah. So, I'm writing now survey mostly about, syntax in, neural networks.",
            "So using mostly frozen network and then probing it to find some syntactic information. So, yeah, the initial plan was to submit it to PROJECT10 and -",
            "I submitted abstracts and next week I should have it ready so.",
            "Yeah. But I don't really, I don't send it to PROJECT10 -",
            "Because maybe -",
            "Yeah and it's also there, I don't know if accept like this kind of -",
            "Overviews.",
            "Yeah. They will accept it. So that, yeah. Yeah, maybe -",
            "I can also show you like the survey visualisation for that so -",
            "Yeah, maybe I can, I can, I can share it, I have it here.",
            "Just a quite, quite.",
            "I can share, share.",
            "It's very small.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, there's quite small.",
            "But I can download it and pictures.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, no time for pictures, but I don't know whether I can that, turn it in, in ORGANIZATION6.",
            "You can hide the left.",
            "Yeah, I can, I can.",
            "Oh, yeah. Thanks. Oh, yeah. So yeah, so, so it's mostly a thing what also PERSON9 was talking about. Comparison of different papers, so I done 4 comparisons and those are on that task of predicting part of speech, type.",
            "Because there is like most commonly found in the most number of papers that we, in like many type reconfigurations. And I compared, 4 pairs of approaches to that, 4 pairs of settings. So, so in one pair there is probing of RNN hidden state versus static for embeddings so it could be the, it could be Glove or, or Word2vec.",
            "So like the main idea of this is that each dot corresponds to, to one pair of results from one paper. It's hard to compare like dots between themselves bec, because, like different paper use different, different types of data and think different and there's like many different things. But still, it's, it's, it's, possible to do a comparison between like two different, underlying systems. So, so word embeddings and, recurrent neura, neural networks. So, yeah, so this is like here everything from recurrent neural networks so is better then more the embeddings which is not that's, that's really.",
            "Not a surprise, this transformer which is also higher. But also, I done, comparison like for rights, plots, by the type of, pre-training task.",
            "So mostly language models and machine translation. And actually, all of those results are from RNNs. I haven't found anything when the compare transformers in one paper but there is like RNNs. But, yeah, there, there is the paper that said that, that machine translation is really better than, than language model, and - No, language model is better than machine translation, but I, I couldn't like really say it from -",
            "Like from this paper -",
            "It was, was, it was cinder but it's like different comparisons to different s, mostly it came from the fact that language model had more data for pretraining.",
            "Then, then -",
            "Yeah.",
            "Machine translation. Yeah and also machine translation vs. out encoders and here were machine translation definitely better and -",
            "Encoders so there are quite not, not that good to, to have the, have the, these part speech encoded in them like mostly because, the, the task is very simple just to translate from lan, one language to the same language so it. Ninety something percent personned lab and, but, not really encode the part of speech.",
            "I think these figures could be included in, into our -",
            "Because you are, you are -",
            "Writing about, about PERSON4.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "These, these papers so -",
            "Yeah.",
            "It could be, could be -",
            "Yeah, I think it would be nice too, to include this. Yeah.",
            "So, yeah, so -",
            "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think all of that would, would fit nicely.",
            "So this is all for part of speech.",
            "This is, these are only for part of speech because, yeah. Most of the papers are about probing for part of speech tag so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I would like to have, to have it there, yeah.",
            "Yeah. It seem nice.",
            "I, I also plan now to do some visualisation about transformers. I think, I would talk to PERSON6 about those. So mostly about like the layer. Whi, which are the layers are the better -",
            "That we compare like different, different, also different probing part, different arch, architecture. This here -",
            "It's like on layer like usually there's like middle layer are better or something like that.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That would be also nice. Yeah. So, yeah. Like I'm not very good at visualisations. I'm fine with writing the text but -",
            "Because some probing is, isn't there are not as many visualisation -",
            "As for, for the, these -",
            "Yeah, but, but these are, these are good.",
            "Yeah, these are good.",
            "Yeah. We should also make sure that all the visualisations look at least similar.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so that is, they're for, for, yeah, my attention is that they are really different.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, I have to, I have to regenerate them and, and, and all in the same colors -",
            "And fonts and -",
            "And...",
            "If you, if you're spending time with that I would, I would suggest, generating them as in, in, as PGF so it's, it's basically in, in, Tix and -",
            "PFG?",
            "PGF. It's, it's basically Tix with, with some LaTex macros and -",
            "Yeah.",
            "I, I it will be the last thing I will, I will do ab, I will first have them somehow -",
            "In some shape, there. And if, if the text is OK, I will regenerate them, the format -",
            "At the, at the end because -",
            "If you, if you have a look - If you have a look in deep learning images slash, underscore, encoding, you can, you'll see how to, how to set up, the LaTeX format. I've been in -",
            "Oh.",
            "In, in our, in our depository.",
            "Aha.",
            "I, I, I have one image like this.",
            "You mean on GitHub?",
            "That's -",
            "In the book repository. Right?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, in, in, in a book repository.",
            "Deep learning, IMG.",
            "Yes.",
            "You can see is encoding PGF?",
            "Yeah, but I meant the, the, the Python script that -",
            "That generates that. PERSON1 is underscoring, yeah, this one.",
            "This one.",
            "And you, you d, do what I, what I do at the top would, after, after importing Matplotlib and then you just save it with, with PGF.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And ending and everything is generated in LaTeX.",
            "So, you then just do input in LaTeX and, and LaTeX would take care about all the forms that will be the same as, as in the rest in the book.",
            "Yeah, I figurate. So, I, yeah, so I will update my, my scripts into my script.",
            "Yeah. Good.",
            "Yeah, right. So, anything else? Anyone? OK, so thank you. So, see you next week and -",
            "Yeah, we should, we should discuss everything like, actually, in like during the, during the week so that we update it. And, OK, so we have like only - Yeah, we have only, yeah, yeah. We have just two weeks. OK. So. So, bye, bye, PERSON7, and see you later.",

            "Everybody is busy, So let's make this very quick. This is just an update, So let's follow the agenda on the ORGANIZATION4 document, The presentation platform, PERSON12, what do you mean by functionalities to be checked?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Do you hear me? Yes, okay. We have refined the function of analyses of presentation platform. And, we would like to share it with you PERSON7 and PERSON6 can your team. In order to check if we misunderstood something, Or if there something we need to add to our analyses, To check in this.",
            "Exactly. So if you scroll down little bit in the agenda, There is a slot on presentation platform. So I just learn from you, What is the status of development. You have the plan, You also has a timeline, Like after we agree, If we agree on the functions that should there you in the next week. When could there be a prototype?",
            "Yeh, It's, we are still planning the development. Of course we started, But there is not due date at the moment, some.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So, what it.",
            "But... First of all we have to check the function analysis.",
            "I totally agree. Let's just think that, we already need it really working in well tested, at the end of June. So I think that the first prototype should be ideally ready, on the 7th of June, like the first very first shot with box and all of that. Would that be feasible?",
            "Ooo, I am not able to tell you if it's feasible, But I taking notes. And I will sure it we the team.",
            "Yeah, okay, And find a slot for the technical discussion. That's exactly what you want. And I wanted. So, are you when is your earliest date for, for technical call, Tomoo. To like this the next week would.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Monday, Monday morning?",
            "Nn, Monday morning, Actually, we have a call twelve o'clock, But early it's perfectly fine for us.",
            "Okay, yes, so Monday, at nine, or ten or as you wish.",
            "Well, Monday at 10, let's see.",
            "Okay, okay. Perfect.",
            "Nice.",
            "So Monday the 20th of May at ten, And will discuss what we need in the platform and. Yeah, perfect. So this all is resolve the presentation platform. Then the integration with PROJECT4. So. Actually I have noticed if PERSON4 is on the call.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, perfect. So great that you are ready to start calling. Excellent. So again, when t. When do you expect to have the prototype? How difficult is this? Is it for two weeks or three weeks it's hard to gets?",
            "Okay, okay, I refuse the ORGANIZATION2 tutorial, I have taking a look at the some work. I don't think dusted off my copy.",
            "Okay.",
            "Number, yes... I, yeah I think I know what I need to do. So I'm gonna start coding next week. I'm very optimistic. I can have a prototype soon like within a couple of weeks.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Translation of all sentences.",
            "Yeah, yeah. The incomplete sentences are question.",
            "Yeah, that's where the big question mark so at the moment, that's what I'm not so sure.",
            "So for th for this we have tried creating corpus of incomplete sentences. And we are continuing translation of our sentence level transformer for these incomplete sentences. And for some reason the training diverged, PERSON6 could tell you more, But we have tried only once. So we need to try a few more times and. Do we have any one from. Yeah, we have PERSON3. So, PERSON3, could you disclose, How should we best handle the incomplete sentences, Because what we do not want to do is to rely on the cashing client. One reason is that we don't have the time to fix the cashing client, Or it's reliable and all that. But the main reason is the cashing client makes the latency too big for the final users. So what we really want to have is to translation of incomplete sentences for the user experience. So the question is, ho. What is the output of the ASR actually, When does the ASR decide to start a new segment, Like to close the previous segment. When I'm looking at the outputs of the ASR, It's not complete sentences, But it's closing off every now and then, So how does this work? And what can we expect to receive for the MT part?",
            "The ASR does not close sentences at all. Is continues sequent.",
            "Okay.",
            "Sequence labeling task which labels were. And eventually will place a label to end the sentence.",
            "And that's where if you if you like bur. If you run into in the EB client, And you see the lines great deal extending, And then suddenly the lines being cut short. This is where the segmentation worker has decided to end the sentence, right?",
            "If you request in the EB client text, Then yes. If you want to see right ASR output I'm not sure if you will have to request the unsegmented text.",
            "Yes. So the from the client. And there is. You see individual words there, In the vertical format, so that one word per line. And the time stamps, Yeh, So the question is, Which approach should we take as the input for PROJECT4 client. Should we rather rely on the segmented output already. But then we need to create the segmenters for all the ASR languages. Well, you have English, You have German, But we don't have Czech. And still it's it was not sentences like what I was getting there.",
            "Both we calls completely spokens of and ASR can change. When ASR decides that given that causes so far, maybe sentence would be better. And so the ASR can change it's mind.",
            "Yeah, so and the output, if you look at the individual segmen, Individual tokens from the if you if you look at the unsegmented output. It would mean that he would suddenly see the same timestamp that you already saw before. But with the same timestamp there would be new token, And if this if the timestamp still falls in the range, Which is like operational in the segmentation worker, Then it will correct it. And emit he new hypoteses within intermediate work changed. And it can. Maybe also happen that the. That segmentation worker has already closed the sentence. But still the ASR worker decides to fix word before this end of the sentence is that possible?",
            "I don't know the exact technical detail of that bound about right. But the ASR signals is explicitly, but come a time when the when the sentences markets final. And that will also.",
            "Yeah, so what do. In general if we run the segmentation worker, If you run pipeline and if we look at the outputs of segmentation workers, We should train our empty systems to work on all the individual lines that we are getting from these. And some of these lines will be complete sentences. And some of these lines will be partial sentences. But generally they will be starting at the beginning of a sentence, Right? Is that correct?",
            "Yes, I'm. I'm not train with these system myself I think we're in the process of doing them, But my intuition would be do not put too much emphasis the incomplete sentences.",
            "The algoritm what the system will be judged by the final translation, And you should the translation was by having incomplete sentences, Which I'm probably not going to be useful translations.",
            "So. Let me. Yeah, let me let me do copy paste of an ugly, or. Actually, I might try share a screen if that works, How do I share the screen, That one select window or screen. And there is screen, Allow. So hopefully I'm now sharing my screen, If you yes, And this is this is the output that we get that we got at the last conference, The mock conference with the interpreters. So this is the output of the secon English unsegmented text, To s to text. So. This is the segmenta English segmentatiton worker, And we are getting outputs like this. So you see that it has been already process by the segmentation worker, And you have the punctuation, But it's still extending the sentences. And then suddenly we see such eee such a message like wanted to do more later on. I saw statistics on the Internet. And in said that I'm. So, Is this the type of input that our empty system should be ready for, Which is starting in the middle of a sentence, Having full sentence. And then continuing with the third one for example, It can happen here that. This one, the middle line. Can. Can you see it? Is it. Is it legible on?",
            "I can see it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And have to check in details to logs. But I think that is what, yes.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so PERSON4. I think that we should proceed, PERSON play with PERSON6 and you. And we should change our training data for the MT systems, So that they would gracefully handle input like this.",
            "Okay.",
            "Translating partial sentences and even more sentences in one go. This is not far from the context, Dependent mission translation that we have tried for this PROJECT1 so technically the segments are not too long, They never spent too much beyond this, What beyond this language that your looking at now, And we just need to make sure that the transform model handle that well. And our idea is to is to train normal sentence to sentence models, Those that you already training. And find tune on these strangely segmented inputs.",
            "Sorry, PERSON7, why does segmentation change, though it sort of it has. I wanted to do more later on.",
            "It is off the eye? Whats going on what's that mean?",
            "PERSON3 would know, I have, I have no idea.",
            "For one thing it's also possible that if it is I'm it knew hypothesis, the segmentation as we run output segmentation might be different. That's one possibility. The other possibility is that maybe if ASR only changes one word for the fact that my one word. I would have to be at the coding.",
            "Cause the first segmentation is fine. And then a split softly eyes. We wanted your empty system was use the first segmentation. I want to do more later on which is absolutely fine and then it is gone crazy. And you if.",
            "It is not really crazy. What I'm miss here, And I think that's that's a problem that has to be solve very soon is that the herd zero. These are probably the timestamps. And the segmentation worker is not emitting timestamps, It receives timestamps with the individual tokens from the ASR, But it doesn't emit them. Right? Is that is that correct PERSON3?",
            "It doesn't emit something. I'm not sure what exactly those on.",
            "Yeah, so I would. I think that this is something that ORGANIZATION6 needs to investigate and improve the segmentation worker so that it emits the timestamps. Because these timestamps would then allow us to like handle the translation well. We need you. Realize that this part. This saw statistics on the internet, Actually starts in the middle of or like is it some continuation of something which already output. And then the alignment. PERSON1.",
            "I'm not sure it is here.",
            "We have already probably getting good translation of that sentence. So we really don't wanna be translating again and complainig about time.",
            "Yes, yes. Yeah. So the problem is that if we have from these. Even if these are not zeros. If the are. If these are the timestamps of the beginning. And the end of this later and not, Then we are not, We do not know the timestamps for the individual parts like here internet full stop. And then we don't know where to where to start, Like redoing the translation. So there will be quite on tricky coordination between the components. So how do we proceed? We have some of the sample data. I think that yeah. I think that the order of. The thing that the thing that we have to do is first. We need to ask PERSON3, Or someone from ORGANIZATION6 to validate these locks to help us create a reliable locks from the ASR workers, So that we are seeing what we are supposed to be seeing, And this should include timestamps. And then we should, yeah, And then we should decide how to. The baseline would be indeed to follow the segmentation coming from the segmentation worker, Which, Which get worse, here with the with the eyes saw statistics, And then the final experience of the user experience the of translation would not be good, Because the statistics of on the internet will translate only the later part of sentence. I think we should go for this baseline for the workshop. So the baseline would be to have models that translates this. And even if it's damaging the tail of the sentence which was previously translate better. I would prefer that, over like. Over translate over waiting for full sentences. When the cashing cli. Cashing worker. So I think for the user experience it will be better. If we translate these incomplete and slightly damaging sentences, Rather than having the cashing worker, Which we have had in the past, as a fair. And the cashing worker took too much time to actually close the sentences. And only the junk for translated to lights. So the baseline is to, Keep the segmentation coming from the segmentation worker and translate sentences like this. The improved goal probably not for this. This workshop would be to preserved the good part, As it was translated already, And, then only update the next part. And this could be also done actually at the level of this source words strinks. So we didn't - We do not necessarily have to rely on the alignment. We can realize that we already saw this. I saw statistics on the internet. We could realize that this is the suffix of that, And we could realize that we don't. We want to skip this from the imput. So we could, this. This cleverness could be part of the empty worker.",
            "I don't want to. And the risk of false information for the most part I think the empty worker does do these things. And details I recommend you have to that I posted last time. Which is the code for the emptyworker, Not the actual MT part. But every everything from the moment it's your network and after it get back from your network. So all the change together, were this part and.",
            "Yeah. So this is this is important for PERSON4. If you and PERSON4 could like synchronize. And make sure that PERSON4 will know where the relevant code is, Then PERSON4 can decide whether in his re-implementation for PROJECT4. He can directly use that code, Or whether he has to like created that from scratch for some reasons, And then we would have to postpone it. And it will have only the baseline that I just described for the workshop. Does that make sense? Do you agree?",
            "That sounds reasonable to me here.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON4 please, take an old, And make sure to try to look up of this thing in the existing code, in the ticket. And then let me know, Maybe in the call next week, Like whether do this worked but for the. I think that PERSON4 we should try to train the models to be ready to accept like partial sentences, And even inputs that started at the middle of sentence. So me and PERSON6 will try to get the this part working, which is like finetuning normal empty models for a bad. Badly segmented inputs. So PERSON6 please take the note on your side, But we need to figure out what why we failed. And we should get that running, And that way, hopefully, Will have the correct segmentation from the existing old from the ORGANIZATION6 emtpty workers, Available also in the new PROJECT4 empty worker. But as a fall back we should have a models that are ready for such input. And one thing is still missing. And that the segmentation worker trained for Czech, But that is also really depended obviously on the on the ASR for Czech. Ok. So I'll stop sharing the screen, And let's move to the let's move to the ORGANIZATION4 document again. So there is, Where are we integration of PROJECT4. This is what we have covered. So, still not sure how to best handle two options, Two options reuse called from ORGANIZATION6. PERSON4 to synchronize with PERSON3. And tell us next week if this works. Option two is to train MT or fine tune send level models to gracefully handle badly segmented input. And this will make a fall back solution for. Well, Fully following the segmentation from the segmentation worker. Even if it damages tails of previously translated sentences. Okay. Then the production client. That's PERSON6. Well, the thing is that EB client will now in a different connector. And it's, the main. What is the main message PERSON6. Well. We would just rename that, Right? PERSON6, are you there? We can not hear you. I do not know what's, Yeah, I don't know, if PERSON6's here. No, we can not hear you. Okay, So never mind. The idea is that we are. We are working on this cruise control. And it will use this report, Which is now called the production connectors, So that it is no longer labor prototype. And we are testing it in the in the dry runs. Okay, do we have? If PERSON6 is able to connect better later on, Then we can learn perhaps more details. We don't have PERSON9 here English and German ASR, What is the status there. I think PERSON3 can say that. You probably think it's all right. It is it is working, And nothing has to be done, Right? Or are there any, any changes with this?",
            "ASR working fine.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "We spoke yesterday.",
            "Yeah, one thing is the language model adaptation. So that's, adaptatiton. Are you ready for us to send the plain text files and add work granularity. We can have plain text files with relevant well slide. From the slides from related documents, And we can give it to you at the level of individual presentations, Or we can lump all of those together for the day, Or for the whole today workshop. So, what type of data can you make use of.",
            "Generally any sort of text is, On sure exactly how detailed it has to be. I'm, I'm not sure.",
            "Yeah. So please investigate. Whether in the end, you are going to lumb them all together, And prepare one language model. And like start the workers with the one language model for this workshop, Or whether there is a mechanism that we could make it presentation or per day. I do not know how difficult is it, To get it change to a different language model.",
            "So the minds of the mechanism, We are not using such a mechanism anymore. We have one thing it's a lot of effort language models and it's also possible that models system don't need adaptation any more.",
            "Okay.",
            "I will have to ask back ASR people.",
            "Yeah. So, please you, Let us know next week, Yeah, PERSON3 to investigate what will be supported at PROJECT3. So it's up to you. If you decide that you don't want to do any ASR adaptation to the text, That's fine, If you do it and because you, you find it like useless, If it is the model is the domin indepedant enough that will be sufficient. If you decide that you would like it from us at the level of individual presentations, We will have to discuss the technical details like where to put the files and all that we're surely collecting the files. And will try to do fine tuning of the machine translation models based on that we can get based on the monolingual include files. So we're surely doing domain adaptation somehow, And will see how far and get it. PERSON3, okay. Okay, So please tell us next week then, Please tell us next week. Excellent. The Czech ASR. Well, PERSON11 is not here, But he is working hard to get the pipeline, The training for call the running, What we are. So, yes, We should call the integration, Call the integration and segmentation worker for Czech. We are still in the face of creating the ASR models ourselves. And, we have not yet started with the called integration, Really like coding the. We do not have the final decision, How we do it. So this is still very risky, Whether we will have Czech ASR for the workshop or not, But still. The workshop runs in English. And as you know, We are organizing to have student translators there. So there will be, originally English from the floor. There will be one or two English respeakers, Like parallel respeakers to choose the one which works better. There will be one interpretation of from English into Czech and one interpretation from Czech into German. So the German would be double delayed, But still thanks to this double digestion it can be better. So we will see in practice, Whether we like. Which output we like best. Whether from the ASRs of English, And which one of those. We can skip ASR if we don't have it. And we can have the ASR from, from German, If that's if that appears the best. Okay, so this is to give you the whole picture. PERSON6 should be able to speak now, But.",
            "Yes, can you hear me now?",
            "Yes, yes,",
            "Perfect.",
            "So is there anything about the connector to the main client to say?",
            "I don't think so just there will be another I changed the whole structure and we will continue deployment there.",
            "Yeah, okay. Then for the daily testing so far. We don't have the daily test yet, But we have the install and test scripts, And we run them every now and then. So I think we should as weeks pause we should indeed do this on a daily basis. But it is not critical. We're, we're already using that report. And we are, We are doing the test manually not automatically. But it's.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's there. And then the machine translation systems, Multilingual English tool any is currently training, Okay, That's good, because the student I have for this is not delivering anything. He is still like. He knows how to train PROJECT4, But somehow it doesn't really work for him. So if we can get the models from PERSON4, That's more. Is much safer, yeah. And the. I think we have discussed this.",
            "Yeah, we already cover that point, I guess, You mentioned you will gonna try to get some data from PERSON8.",
            "Yes.",
            "It any further with that?",
            "So this will be. Well, I have not emailed, you know him as well, But I've talked to him before, And I don't have the data, the input data now, Because we are still collecting them from. Actually we're, Shortly we should be deploying the platform, The tiny webpage to collect the documents, Then the ORGANIZATION3 will populate this with the documents, Then I will convert the documents the plain text. Then I will send these plane text to ORGANIZATION7, Then ORGANIZATION7 will extract, all they have. And then will get the data from the ORGANIZATION7. So this is something that well has a long pipeline, But we'll get there, someday. So, what is the latest date, When we needs the input for the fine tuning? So, we need the MT domain dependent data for MT fine tuning by. So.",
            "Fine tuning I guess we don't need too much time, probably.",
            "Yeah.",
            "One week of the event would be okay.",
            "Wednesday, June 19, yeah. Still it's quite early. Okay, so I'll work back from this date, And hopefully will have it um-hum. Yeah, PERSON3 is empty that's on a German to English, Mainly because the English ASR will be a, So then, our main input will be the English ASR. Or one of those from the rich speakers, The secondary, like the fall back input could be from German to English, And then I would indeed rely on the ORGANIZATION2 platform to do to do the pipoting. So if we r. If we select the German ASR as the most reliable source, Even with the double delay. And the extra pivoting, Then we would need the German to English empty system, And then the English to multilingual empty system. So I would now like to learn from PERSON3, That this empty system works and emits outputs in such way that the subsequent English to something, And the system can directly connect and ORGANIZATION2 platform will do it, Is that true?",
            "So it depends emits output, I don't think that the that should work, I can report back to you. But I can say that English German to English is probably our best translations systems transform model so would get better.",
            "Yeah, from English for. Yeah, so and also PERSON12. So this is something where PERSON12 and you should coordinate. And tested whether the platform indeed support pivoting, Cause you, at the ORGANIZATION6 you also have English to something empty systems. So please try a pipeline where you use your. Where you use German ASR, German to English empty system. And then English to anything just for the sake of testing this pipeline.",
            "Okay, just I'm taking note. We see German ASR, German to English machine translation,",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, and?",
            "And English to anything machine translation and the presentation platform at the end.",
            "English to anything.. translation...",
            "Yes, this pipeline, And German, yes, the German ASR ORGANIZATION6 German English empty, ORGANIZATION6 English whatever, Whatever empty and then presentation.",
            "Okay, Sorry what do you mean for pivoting.",
            "Well, the pivoting is that you connect these two empty systems. That's the, That's the idea of pivoting, That you are translating to whatever via English.",
            "Okay, okay. Thank you.",
            "So please, test this, And let us know again next week, If this works, Because then we will be replacing this part was the PROJECT4 worker that PERSON4 will be developing, But we need to know that the rest works. Okay. Thank you. So PERSON6. Test the fine tuning from start document on real. Yes. So there is a new idea. Big next only corpus.",
            "I will alreday report everything works.",
            "This works? Okay? Excellent.",
            "ASR outputs.",
            "PERSON3, what were you saying? What works? This the German ASR this one. PERSON3 are. PERSON3, are you looking at the ORGANIZATION4 document? PERSON3 confirms this works except the new ORGANIZATION2 except the nonexisting. ORGANIZATION2 presentation platform. Right?",
            "Yeah, So I just tested by starting one about English workers and pivoting over English worker.",
            "Yeah, And it was in the at the level of partial sentences? So there was no cashing, Cashing worker involved?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, Okay, Right. Yep. So than PERSON6. Can you very briefly say about this, Because we were discussing this, what is your idea.",
            "Yes.",
            "Wide failed, And then so on.",
            "So I tried to fine tunder original model on sub sentence window of size three to fifty words. And we did to cuts on alignments. So we have. So we have paralel subsentence corpus, And we have for now only to that corpus two milions of words, About one thousand documents. And soon we have audias of these documents. So we can run ASR on this and train on the. On the output from ASR with errors against the references.",
            "But for it we need to the final hypoteses from ASR. And now I had publick. Now, now I have new idea that we can take paralel big paralel text only corpus then we are text to speech on it, And then ASR, And we try and on the output from ASR with errors against the original targets.",
            "Yes. So aa. PERSON3 would you expect this to work reasonably well, And what text to speech should we use? I would, I would be somewhat skeptical about ASR from t. From text to speech.",
            "Yeah, so would I on this very most important thing would be text to speech on models one speaker. And know, know background conditions, very, very I am not ASR researcher. But I don't think that it would be data at all.",
            "But it will do the same errors on name entities and rire works as usual speaker at least. So I think, the empty system can prepared for the such errors.",
            "Yeah. Looked to one of the top as SLT systems in last year's, And they were using this technique as. It was only one aspect of their systems. So I'm not sure exactly how.",
            "Important.",
            "How effective it was but they were using this.",
            "So, Let's us keep this idea in mind. But I don't think that it's. It's good to for suite for this workshop at the end of June.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So. So let's plan it. So let's postpone this after PROJECT3. What I like though is the first one to train on real ASR from docks. So this is this is something that you are probably already doing so for this. We need to run ORGANIZATION6 ASR on the docks, Record the locks, Including timestamps, And then, and then like fiddle with the alignments and segmentation, Yeah making our paralel data for training of empty similar to the segmentation. Or like miss segmentation that we get from the ASR segmentation worker. So this is this is like a realistic test, Where we have the audio, And we can observe real segmentation as we get it from the segmentation worker. And then we can use this segmentation with the paralel data to change the paralel data, So that are segmentation mimics what the what the segmentation workers is doing, And this would be the, the data for fine tuning the empty systems. So. Okay, so we will let you know the next week, How this whether we've succeeded, Whether we were able to, to proceed to process that docks with ORGANIZATION6 with the existing workers or whether we failed, And so on. Yeah, Okay, Thank you. And yes, waiting for the integration. So will know from PERSON4 how that works. The binding, I agree. It's not a priority at the moment. Because we are planning to rely on the on the PROJECT4, Then anything, yeah, yeah, So anyone coming to LOCATION1 in person? This is just to do the planning. Are you, is anyone planning to come for the workshop? I do.",
            "Well, you are in LOCATION1. Oh, yes.",
            "So let us know, Or especially PERSON5 know, If you were planning to come in person to see it live. I think it would be useful. But it is not critical. It would be. It would be useful, But we could do it, Even say, would be extremely useful for you to see the whole thing in practice, Because the last person we had here were PERSON2. Who knows how things work, And then it is a getting. PROJECT5. Yeah, and PROJECT5, but PROJECT5 is known project. So it would be better if someone from the project was here. Just let us know later on. We have discuss the presentation platform, And then is it. Is there anyway this like a feature request for ORGANIZATION2? Is there a way to avoid broken workers while starting a client? If we know that some work. Yeah?",
            "May I ask you to explain me a little bit more this.",
            "Yeah. So we know from experience that ORGANIZATION6 is running age ASR workers for English, And four of them don't emit any output. And if we run the same client, The same pipeline concurently six times, We will end up with four lines four pipelines four sessions ineffective, And the fith and sixth one working well. So like in search for components that work, It would be better if we could simply say please start this pipeline again. And avoid this worker, Because it's under the control of ORGANIZATION6 the worker claims it's working, But it's not delivering the output. So we would like to as the users at the end of the client, Would like to say, We want to build this pipeline, But avoid this particle worker, Because last time it didn't work for us.",
            "So you are asking a. A kind of a ban of not working workers.",
            "Yes.",
            "No, At the moment it's not possible. Of course, is being on the idea that. Who subscribes the mediator as service is able to provide the service, But I can take a note and check it with the team. It is possible something like this. I have to say that it's not easy, Because of course, ORGANIZATION2 platform is based on having distributed services allowed you would join. And leave the service, It's not that easy to imaging such kind of behaviour, But we can reason about it, of course,",
            "Another option would be to somehow like have tests of workers, And the workers should themselves or the party, who is providing the workers should be able to test individual workers. And if they don't work as the party themselves expect, They would kill the worker. So like I imagine that at ORGANIZATION6, There could be a script every two minutes or whatever, Looking at all the ideal workers. And asking for a particle worker, To test it. And if the test fails, Then ORGANIZATION6 would know which worker is it. And they would kill it on their side, And then it would not be available anymore in the platform. So that's another options. So another, PERSON7 says another option would be to force the platform to use particular worker for pipeline or for session, Use quick test session as they side of AG ORGANIZATION6 for each of their workers. And if they do not pass their test, ORGANIZATION6 could kill them.",
            "Yes, of course, We have to define what suitable for each kind of service. It's not that easy to manage it also in this way. But of course is something we can reason about.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. Thank you. Well, is there any further questions, Please ask, Otherwise let us give us give ourselves at least ten minutes break before the next call.",
            "Okay, just.",
            "Right?",
            "I has just a question regarding your note in presentation platform the PERSON7 experiments, Fix experiments, Probably we discussed about it on Monday.",
            "Yes, exactly this is. This is this is to be. This is to be discussed on Monday. So we don't. But you can ask now.",
            "Yes, in the mean by if you want to share with us your experiment, We can check it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Maybe this afternoon in order be more prepared on Monday.",
            "Okay, yes.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you. So I. I add note for myself. Thank you. Any other questions?",
            "I would like to press some of the ASR clients or the are not working. Then you have to tell us. And then we can. We can do something about that.",
            "Yeah, We will apply. PERSON9 is responsive, I know though we just email him, And then get him on slack. And then he restarts it and it works. We just find it like off. We don't want to bother you. If we can work it. Work around for that ourselves for our quick test at random times of the day. So I'm. I was not complaining in anyway exactly as I said, PERSON9 has always quickly helped us. But still there is this risk that PERSON9 would be giving lecture, Or whatever would not be available. And in that case, it may be very useful to have this to have this option.",
            "Does this happen often?",
            "Every time we try like after a week of not trying.",
            "We have. We have sessions starting, stoping with regular election tranclation so it's four to six times a day, And the worker is still all work after three weeks. So I'm I'm wondering why you are having this problem all, And then we.",
            "Yeah, So we should try to investigate, The when whenever this happens again. Will tell not only PERSON9 but also you, So that you could diagnose, Right?",
            "Interesting is also is the usual problem that the person the worker is not free dubt as mark is busy in which case you couldn't even start new session, Because.",
            "That's not the case, That's different.",
            "And we're having even a different problem. I personally not able see.",
            "Yeah, we're simply not receiving any output from the worker. It connects. But it doesn't emit any output at all. Will let you know.",
            "Doodle let us know maybe we can have a - I think there's a mechanism, WiFi something. Worker is hearing.",
            "Yeah, Okay, Yeah, Yeah, Thank you. So PERSON6 please remember that next time we would like to make of such failure to debug thats. Okay. Thanks a lot. And let's let's talk in five minutes again, Maybe not all of you, But the general PROJECT2 call. Okay, So thank you very much for your time. I was hoping to have this faster, But. Well, there is too many things to discuss. Sorry. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Bye, bye. Bye."
