So, sorry that I didn't remind everybody to – to connect. And – I'm happy to see that you are here. So, let's start. And also my machine crashed in the meantime, so I had to, like, restart it.

And she – and she has some progress, and then – then she will move it to the spreadsheet, so we can get, her feedback and – and continue with that.

So, some files are still – Have still weird output. But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.',\n  'Okay, thanks.',\n  \"Yeah, that's great. So, I support this, it's, it's, it's great that, Dá. PERSON7, you have thought of PERSON11. And PERSON11 now has the time. There are other things where I was, thinking of PERSON11 and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening. So if you, PERSON11, had the time. Obviously, there is no way we could do it for the next week. But we should really have the system – ready for –\",\n  'I looked at the tutorial from, from, from the NLP was it?',\n  \"For the upcoming sessions and I've asked demand because I've seen the meme project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's sli – slightly easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But, their mission translation is doing shortening simply because the data is shortening. And that's because their target size, is – are the subtitles which are created for the hearing-impaired. So, there is like natural shortening in the data. It'd be great if we could also locate some, such type of the data where there is some natural shortening happening. We would – wou – We would put it in the architecture.\",\n  \"That's also possible. But also, I looked at the, at the – Tutorial from the, from the –\",\n  'Yeah, it was.',\n  'Yes. Actually, so – So, all of our models, basically work with, with, yeah, sequence to sequence where we just process the entire – Input sentence. And, then, when we have the final, output from, from, from the entire input sentence, we, start, generating, but, the output sentence. But, but, actually, so – The people from – I think, it was actually. They are doing it, so that they are just processing prefixes. So they pre – Process first key words as they, as they, give them into the input. And hen they generate the first word. And, and then, basically with every new token that they get. They generate, the new – One new token. So, basically, it is much faster because you just generate one word at a time. And also, I think it – It could be quite easy to implement the, shortening in this, in this model as well.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  'Because we can just stop generating after some time.',\n  'Yeah. So, it would be shortening because we ran out of time, right?',\n  'Yes. So basically we would just, call it like to – We would just train it, so that it s – Stops generating it after the – Some, some time. Yeah. So, so that could also work.',\n  'Yeah. So they have talked to PERSON9. Or PERSON9 mentioned it in a call that is, PERSON3 is not ready, has no, specific things, for speech translation. So this and other strategies are no longer PERSON3.',\n  'Okay, okay, so we would have to implement this.',\n  \"Yeah. And there is nobody – In Edinburgh, who would have the time to do that. So if you would have the time, then you are one possible candidate. And we actually don't have any other candidates. Where maybe I thought that, that maybe some students of PERSON1, I do not know if he is on the call already. But that is also like very risky and like distant. So it would be difficult, but, so that – The only other possible candidate would be, PERSON13, from the PROJECT1. Who, like, works halfway in Prague and halfway in Brno. But he is working on other things in PERSON3. So, I don't want to, like, to focus him too, too, much. So – PERSON11, Please, think about it. If –\",\n  \"Okay, okay, bso right now I don't know if it is realistic, because I, I was just looking at the PERSON3 some time ago. And, I saw, basically, like, yeah. It's quite like, quite low level. It's written in. So, I don't know how, how hard it will be to change this.\",\n  'Yeah.',\n  \"But if I, I see that it is possible, if I understand what's going on in the code, then, yeah, I –\",\n  'Yeah.',\n  'Will like, let you know, based on, yeah, what they thi –',\n  \"Yeah. Thanks. So let me check the – This is so – So poor. I would never use – So, we have PERSON2, PERSON4 and PERSON8 you here on the call further. So now, from all of you, I would like to hear an update for the sessions, for next week. So, one thing is the Monday seminar. That should be done very easily, don't bother yourself with that much. But I think that PERSON4 should just like, click, click on s – some buttons and get the get the, vocabulary, expanded for that, right?\",\n  'Well, yes – Will work on it tomorrow.',\n  \"Yes, but then a lot of effort is to be put into – the preparation for the two setups. For, PROJECT2 and. And, PERSON4 you mentioned that you don't have the webpage for PROJECT2. Is that still true?\",\n  'No. I fi – found it. And I, I just saw the programme for PROJECT2, and I was checking the talks. And I am trying to, gather the data. The relevant from those parts that are mentioned in the programme.',\n  'So, could you mer. Maybe, per – perhaps – Well, oh, you are you away? So, you are away the whole Friday? Or only at eleven?',\n  \"I'm away from eleven to one. No, ten to twelve.\",\n  \"Ten to twelve. Okay, so in the afternoon, for example, in the Czech afternoon. You are able to, to do something. So, I would suggest if it's not too late for, for issue. And I guess it's not. That, you could have a Zoom call again with the videos and – And to, to have a dry run of some past similar talks to PROJECT2 talks. And see how that system works. And, at the same time, we can do the same thing with the for example. The, the, Supreme Audit talks. So they are in the elite, the death set. So I will. We have the links, some or else, maybe –\",\n  \"I'm, I'm a bit afraid that the probably will not be prepared till tomorrow. Because tomorrow I will be working on the Monday seminar model as well. So I think we can run the dataset for Monday.\",\n  'Yeah, well –',\n  'Is it too late?',\n  'The more tests we do, the better. So, even if we do the test of, like, the two concurrent subtitlings without domain adaptation, it would be useful test.',\n  'Okay. For sure.',\n  'So, so, PERSON8, if you could plan for tomorrow afternoon, so that –',\n  \"Yeah, I'm planning to do that.\",\n  \"So there – It will be two videos, played concurrently. So that actually means that we need you to operate two machines. That's another critical thing.\",\n  \"I can't op – I can operate two machines. I have two laptops at home. So, I can do that, I guess.\",\n  'Yes, but you need two local machines. You need to unit ark, and one more machine with X to go.',\n  'I can use black bird.',\n  'Okay. Yeah. So Ark and blackbird, right? Yeah. So tomorrow in the afternoon, should we say, like one or two, Czech time. What is better for you?',\n  'Both is okay with me.',\n  'Both are good for me.',\n  'So I suggest that at one. Czech time. So, like, Zoom Test for – Two – YouTube videos at the same time. So, PERSON8, would the, two, presentations be ready to paragraph use ready?',\n  \"So I got the access to, my engage, last night, so it was pretty late in India. So I didn't set up my account. Then, I will complete it today. Basically yesterday, I, worked with all the steps. So, it should be easy for me to do that now. Oh, it will be done today, I guess. Yeah. So tomorrow we are going –\",\n  'There is, there is some chance that – Yeah. So, and PERSON6 will provide – PERSON8, PERSON8, setting up, two presentations. So, and PERSON4, PERSON4 has been working on adaptation, for the two domains. PERSON8 setting up to online text – To paragraph setting. On quest plus virtual machines, behind. And then, Friday, test time for two concurrent sessions. So it will be arc plus blackbird. One will follow saw video, one will follow. I will say CL video. So PERSON4, if you put, could put a link here. Please add a link – PERSON4 – And, I will put a link, PERSON6 will put a link here. Yeah, so this will be the two videos. We will start them, and we will watch that. The pipeline will be probably the very same. But still, you should like, have it as two separate pipelines. And you must not mess it up. And later. Like later Friday, or on, in, on Monday. The models will be updated with the, with the domain elected ones.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  \"So, on Friday, use – Two separate pipelines, but each running actually the same thing. Update the – each of the pipelines – Each of the pipelines on Monday for the two different domain adaptations. Yeah, so that is, that. And I'm curious about the evaluation, the scores, so PERSON8, you have mentioned that you are already doing some ASR.\",\n  \"Yeah, so, I am compiling some days, are tasked for that. But I am, facing some issues. It's basically that some videos are not, are not, some videos are not properly into a 16 cave format. So I'm looking into that. So PERSON10 told me yesterday that there are some issues with some audio, and I have to do that manually if that does not happen.\",\n  'Yeah. So, this is essential – This should be – We should, we all should know like how to do it. It should be part of the automatic evaluation of a leader test set, right?',\n  'It is, yeah, it is.',\n  'That is, that is not working properly.',\n  'Yeah. But there are some audio files, where it, it gets converted to, the MP3 format. But when you pass it to the sound system, or the sound system will not work on that.',\n  'So this is this is strange. Issues with some files – With the – The 16 c – format, converted from so – Yeah, PERSON8, seek for any help you can get. If PERSON10 can do that, then, please tell PERSON10 to do it.',\n  'Yeah, he is here with me, to do it. So I am doing it today, but –',\n  'Yeah –',\n  \"That, that takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is are getting passes where they. So once I know that I can keep a track of it, so, for future – Or actually, for future I would not. Would not need it, because once I have the web be file, I probably won't, won't need to do convert.\",\n  'Well, this, this should be actually – Can you still hear me? The sound quality is a little worse. So this should really be done, all the time. So every time we run this evaluation, it should be, run from scratch. So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a and fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.',\n  'Yeah. But still, if I am keeping track of the files, which, are – need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of at least the known ones. And of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.',\n  \"Yeah. So this is an important thing that we should have, like come across, or it is, a months ago. Remember, it is, is – since August that I've been telling you that, that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And, like every time, you, you all. It is not just you, you personally, PERSON8. There were other things, obviously. But like, every time, you thought about that, you thought that, well, this will be easy. We will just run it. And only when you actually do it, you will see all the problems. So this is known, common. It is always like that. So that's a message for everybody. Before you try, you never know what would be the problem. So for example, the call that I had, that, there was, someone was interviewing me so they, they, they wanted to record the video. Zoom never worked as badly for me as it, as it was today for the recording. So before you do, you cannot say whether it will work or, or not. And here we are running on the, in the problems of conversion, of the, of the file formats. So hopefully, we will be able to, like, quickly get the numbers. So do you have any word error rates so far?\",\n  'No, I have not processed it. So PERSON1 said that, once, they get the transcript, we will done it together. Because he also has not thoroughly the system. So he wanted to do it together.',\n  'Yeah, ye – And you have the –',\n  \"And I'll have a call with –\",\n  'Today.',\n  'Yes.',\n  'Yes, that is very important. So PERSON1 is going to be extremely busy, because he is organising some event, tomorrow and over the weekend. So we, we must not rely on PERSON1, so today is your last chance to get it running before the, the weekend. And then only from Monday onwards, probably he, he could help. So that is that thing.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  'Than maybe, have also PERSON10 on that call with PERSON1? Is that planned that way?',\n  'Not right now. I will ask PERSON10 if he is available.',\n  'Please do. And, who else could be of any help there? So, my only thinking, is of PERSON11 who was able to simply come by and help immediately.',\n  \"Well, in this – I do not think anything will be, any – I don't know. For now, there are like a lot of things to run, but I'm also simplifying everything, so that, we won't have – I think –\",\n  \"Yeah, okay. Yeah, so let's hope it will all work out. So, as soon as you have any numbers, please send them to me. Just, regardless how low or high the numbers are, this – Just receiving the numbers will be a big relief for me.\",\n  'I will, at least for – I, at least for, I will send you the numbers today. Yeah, so for which data set, the –',\n  \"It is a khanic admitted, that, it is the 2020, it's part of that.\",\n  'Khan, Khan Academy? Ok, it is just – I mispronounced it. So probably, you know the correct pronunciation, and I do not recognise it. Yeah. So there is these saw files. And these are more important, because they reflect the domain that we have for the SG1 meeting. And there is the money dogs, and these are important for the, SL domain.',\n  'Yes, oh, okay, so, I, I, I will all the three.',\n  \"Yeah, okay, great. Yeah. And, so, I know that PERSON4 is working on the adaptation for the two domains. We'll do a Monday seminar, tomorrow, that we will like, one shot think. And, I'm very curious. So, PERSON4, are you taking a part in that call, with PERSON1 as well?\",\n  'No.',\n  \"I think it is a, I think you – you also should, because, you should also evaluate, the – So, I'm hoping that you will be able to have the multiple custom dictionaries in the, our system. The dictionaries that come from PERSON2, and that you will choose, which is the best, one. That you will have some numbers to, to choose – which of the ASR systems should be used. Which of the vocabulary should be used. And for that you need the evaluation. So, whatever you see by, shown by PERSON1, will be also useful for you. Unless you already know how to run SLTF.\",\n  \"No, I don't know yet. And, so, I think there are some things to discuss about the, the multiple dictionaries. I received your email yesterday with, the thing I was – I mentioned in the mail, that the ASR system without using people's pronunciation was better than the one used with people's generated pronunciations.\",\n  'So, so, sorry, say it again, and be more precise. So PERSON2 sent this email with the four words, the Watson, IBM –',\n  'Yes. So this was. So, I sent the, files to PERSON2, three kinds of IBM and three kinds of Watson.',\n  'Yeah. So he sent me, the phonemes spoken in those files.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  'And so, since his model works on some ESL. And so he first recognised the words in the audio file, and then converted into phonemes and then sent it to me.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  'So there was – For example, there was one file in which the word was for IBM. And so – The ESL decoded it, as I think, four IBM, and so the phonemes were. So in this way, he sent me the phonemes, and I added those pronunciations in my dictionary. And so the performance of de – description was exactly the same with the – without adding these pronunciations in their dictionaries. And the one, domain adaptation model, that I developed with my manual, pronunciations. The perform is slightly better than, these models.',\n  'Okay, yeah. Yeah, well, this is too small of a sample. And then I know that – PERSON2 produced, the long, word list, right? And you have not tested that one yet.',\n  'Yes, there is, there is a phoneme to grapheme list.',\n  'Yes.',\n  \"I do not – So, or I'm confused. How can I use it as it is? I think, that can be used by developing for some model, from forming the graphic model and then using it.\",\n  'No, no, no. This is – This is exactly what you did with the Watson. So, you just swap the columns.',\n  'Okay, okay.',\n  'So you just convert the, the international phonetic alphabet into the phonemes, that, that CMU knows.',\n  'So it means that, that the list should contain Watson.',\n  \"Well, I don't know if the list contains Watson, but it's –\",\n  'But I mean, it assumed that the list should contain our words –',\n  'Yes. Yeah, yeah. And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So, the thing that I asked for, is that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM. This will be not so frequent. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this alzo, if you remember, if he says this alzo with Z 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the Z. And if he sometimes manages to say correctly also, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like, PERSON4 to be in touch with PERSON2. Maybe you continue on call, right? I have to – I, I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids, the, the, the lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So PERSON4, please show to PERSON2 what is the dictionary that the system is accepting. Share your screen, and, and show it. And PERSON2, please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will be still needed, is the, language model substitute. But all these words, should be like the known words. So PERSON4, you need to figure out what words are in the – in the language model. And the words which are in the language model, should be simply copied. So the, the dictionary will have three columns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognised. The phonemes, as PERSON2 proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third column, that will be also the same again for all of those, and there will be, again, the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees. And I think that this way, the – these systems should be able to load it. And you will also possibly run into one more problem, that is not ready for two big custom dictionaries. So this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the you two together. So PERSON2 knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like, when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two knowledges – Pieces of knowledge together. So that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.',\n  'Okay, okay.',\n  'So PERSON2, does this make sense?',\n  \"Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.\",\n  'Yeah, so is there anything else, PERSON2, that you – that you have?',\n  \"Well, maybe, maybe interesting information for Dominik. I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for, for time stamping. I'm not sure, how, good it will be because I'm trying to do it on Libry Speech. And although, when I was downloading, it, they claimed it has more than 600 hours. But then the training said that the actual training set contains only around 300 hours. And I'm still not sure whether this 300 hours does not contain, similar sentences. Or actually the same sentences, but spoken by, by, by different speakers. Yeah, so it's, it is, because, well – For example, in English or Czech I was used to, used to observe more steep conversions. And now it – now it, won't convert so fast. So, if, if I'm a – I, take, some samples of – during the training. Then there are some, still some, serious errors in the ASR output. So, so, maybe, I'm, I'm hopeful that for, for the time stamping, it is good enough. Or at least we, we might try it.\",\n  'Okay, sure. And is it possible to enrich the language model by texts, because we have lots of relevant texts from your parliament.',\n  'Oh well, for, for the decoding. I, my views also language model. Well, it depends on what we want to do. If we want to just infer like, like open transcripts, then we can, we can use the language model. And we can, we can also get, get the time stamps for, for, for the transcript. If, if you have transcript, and we want just, want to do just a time stamping then there is no way how we can use the language model.',\n  'Yes, I – We may need both. Transcripts for set. Or, I mean, forced alignment for the fantast set. And then reco – Recognition for, for the rest. For around a 100 hours.',\n  'Well, there are for the recognition, there is possibility to use language model.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  'Yeah, thanks for the progress. Please discuss this separately. I just – because I really have to leave. I would like PERSON4 to stay on the call with PERSON2, right? And discuss how to use the dictionary. And I see PERSON10 here. So PERSON10, how much time do you have in the coming days?',\n  'It actually depends on what day are we asking, like, I have some presentations to make an assignments are piling up.',\n  'Yeah. So, well there is a lot of things that PERSON8 needs to do. And I think it would be good if you two would like split it among yourselves so that PERSON8 can manage that in time. So there is this, the scoring, some meeting with PERSON1 this afternoon. So I think you should really join that as well.',\n  'Okay – PERSON4.',\n  'Because this is the numbers that we want to obtain for the different models. And then PERSON8 needs to prepare to have the double system running. We will do first test of this tomorrow at 1 Prague time. So I think that if you, PERSON10, focused more on getting the numbers, and PERSON8 focus more on getting these systems running, then it would – Then we will reach the goals.',\n  'Okay, makes sense, all right.',\n  \"So please discuss this separately to find the time, I don't know the meeting time for, with PERSON1. And, yeah – But I really want to see the numbers. So I would like to have the ASR numbers, today. And improved numbers on Monday, when PERSON4 has the domain adaptation for those. And then we will, on Monday, decide which of the models to use. And we can still move Monday to Tuesday, but Tuesday is already the PROJECT2 day. So the, the CL decision really has to happen on Monday. And we need at least two numbers to compare. So, get one number the baselines now and the – the improved on Monday.\",\n  'Okay, okay.',\n  \"Okay, so I'm leaving at the moment. And if it, asks me to know. Now, PERSON8 is the host, so that is that is good. As long as the PERSON8 is on the call – Like you, the call can run. So please, PERSON4 and PERSON2, synchronise and PERSON10 follow that as well. And PERSON8, and you synchronise – And get the numbers and send any numbers to me today. So as, as a baseline. So thanks and sorry for taking more time. And fingers crossed for – for all the, for these tests. Thanks. All right.\",\n  \"PERSON10, I'll send you a text on Slack later or –\",\n  'Yes.',\n  \"So later today. Because, I was mentioned by you on the call, call yesterday, or the day before yesterday. I tried processing it but I think some of the files, even in khanic terminators are, are those files, which doesn't get converted into 16 format pretty easily.\",\n  \"Okay, that is not, not a big issue. But I'll take care of it again. So, are we discussing anything else? I would stay in the call but I see silence, so –\",\n  'By the way, what do you want compare, PERSON8? All the workers and their quality and latency?',\n  'Actually mostly about the – It is basically about the error rates in multitranslation and the ASR?',\n  \"Yes, I think we have only one option for ASR, don't we? Only one ASR, or there are two?\",\n  'Sorry?',\n  'How many ASR workers do we have?',\n  \"Right now. One is from K80. One is what we use for our Monday Seminars. That's two. Even with K80, we have two. One is the nearest one –\",\n  'Okay.',\n  'Sequence to sequence, the other one is a normal one.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  \"And in the Monday Seminar one, PERSON4 is going, do the adaptation. For – For – both the different tasks. And, finally, on Monday, we'll see, or which model performs best.\",\n  'Yes. When I did the comparison of the workers for SLT. Then I observed that, that there are no big differences in machine translation parts. But the, the bottleneck in quality, was the ASR quality. So you may select the best ASR worker in quality. And then, then, then pick the MT worker with the lowest latency and, and some good flicker. And latency and flicker may test quite, quite easily, on one document. And not, not, on the whole test set.',\n  'Yes.',\n  'I also – During the month of August, we also had numbers for the MT models. Where – What do I say, the rainbow MT models. Scores were better than our, our – I think, yeah, maybe or PERSON11 –',\n  'It was PERSON3.',\n  'You just, PERSON3?',\n  'Think so.',\n  \"I'm not sure. No, I, you – I think you were not there, at that moment so – You may not know about it.\",\n  'I have the school so –',\n  \"Okay, you have this course, so – So – Actually, PERSON5 compared this course between – I think, it was rainbow and, summer set of workers. And rainbows set – a set of rainbow workers were better. I think it was PERSON11's, two, 43 to 43 languages. And that were kind of – They had like little lesser scores, I mean – Rainbow workers had better scores, in, in short, yeah.\",\n  'Okay, basically. What on the remission on the call is divorced to use individual translation workers. You can see if they are performing better. So if not, then obviously we can fall back to, to the rainbow.',\n  \"Okay, so I'll make PERSON4 the host now, because I will go and have my lunch. It is pretty late here, and I did had my lunch.\",\n  'Thank you, bye, bye. And text me on Slack in the weekend.',\n  'Yeah, bye.',\n  'Okay, PERSON7. Okay, I am –',\n  'Bye.',\n  \"I am just – trying to commit it. But – so okay. I have it in the good format now, but I just – because I'm just checking the folders. And for some folders, the output is like totally terrible. I don't know why is this.\",\n  'Okay.',\n  \"But for some folders, it is okay, for some it's terrible. Like all the words are some, just –\",\n  \"It may be caused by the speaker. Maybe he doesn't speak clearly for the ASR.\",\n  'Because, like, it is just like the, most common words in the language, I would say, which are, which are recognised over and over.

This is yeah, and it.',\n  \"Yeah, I'm trying to do this, yes.\",\n  \"And it doesn't matter if, if we miss some, some, me of them. And the annotator will – Can and filter them out, by herself. We can keep them there –\",\n  'Because like for the first files it worked. And now I have files with Czech names. And fo – for this, it is working quite bad.

It just told me like FFMPEG again told me that, that there were wrong time stamps in the file, whatever that means. And basically, the – so – the yes – So, so I, I now see that the transcripts for, for these files are – don't have the right length. So they were processed incorrectly. And I'm not sure how, how to convert them properly, because FFMPEG just returns an error for those files, so – Yeah, but it does not support the format, actually.\",\n  'You may try sox.',\n  \"Yeah, but it doesn't support the format, actually.\",\n  'Which for – format, is it?

Because I think that right now the best way is to throw away everything and to run everything in parallel, so that like in one hour everything would be done.',\n  'Yes. No, no, no, no problem.',\n  \"Because, because like now, I think for – maybe half of the files it would be, you know, like totally wrong.

So I would have to open everything now, or.\",\n  'Yeah.',\n  \"So maybe I'll just change the converting – Okay.\",\n  'And the converting command is called sox. S, O, X.

And without punctuation also.',\n  \"Yes, we don't –\",\n  'Okay.',\n  \"We don't care, so far.\",\n  \"Right. Then you can provide me with it. I'm not sure whether I, I, get it done by today, but –\",\n  'No problem.',\n  'Tomorrow, I think it could be done.',\n  'Yeah.',\n  \"Okay, yeah, one more thing. So I figured out that actually, in the – in some of the files, there is – You don't just hear the interpreter, but you also hear the person saying something in English in the background. So maybe that could also be the problem. The speaking of the wrong person, actually.\",\n  'Yeah, only – only at the beginning or during the whole –',\n  'Everywhere.
