SUMMARY-
 -PERSON173 raises a point of order based on Article 168(2).
  The change in the legal base means that now only Article 95 on the internal market and Article 152 on public health are included as a legal base.
  Therefore, the fundamental change which Parliament wishes to make - in other Parliament voted on a series of amendments affecting Articles 15, 16 and 17.
  The President ruled that they are admissible.
  People will vote against a dual legal base for the original amendments.
