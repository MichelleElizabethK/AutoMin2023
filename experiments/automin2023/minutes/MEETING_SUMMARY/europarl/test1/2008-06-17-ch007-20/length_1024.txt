SUMMARY-
 -The rapporteur on the Environment Committee, Mrs Jackson, has been getting money from a recycling company or a waste-disposal company, when she was actually a member of the Environmental Advisory Board of Shanks plc for the past three years.
 -PERSON140 is glad that Lehideux does not hold her responsible for the decision not to adopt Amendment 27.
