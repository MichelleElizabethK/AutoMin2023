SUMMARY-
 -The Council has considered the new recital 12a adopted by the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs.
  It proposes that criminal liability for environmental damage should be determined by reference to the time of the damage, not to the perpetrator's prior knowledge of the facts constituting the offence.
  According to the letter from the Chair of Coreper, if the text is adopted today it will also be approved by the Council.
