SUMMARY-
 -The next item is the report by Tanja Fajon on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
  The Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for too long.
  The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions and will also help to build cultural, social, economic and political bridges.
  The Swedish Presidency has driven and supported the process of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans from the very beginning.
  The European Commission supports the text of the joint political declaration between Parliament and the Council, supported by the Commission.
  Serbia and Montenegro were exempted from the visa requirement.
  Bosnia and The PPE Group is committed to visa liberalisation for all countries in the Western Balkans by July 2010.
  It is regrettable that the authorities in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are lagging behind.
  It took the group three months to reach an agreement.
 -PERSON239, on behalf of the Socialist and Democrat Group, thanks rapporteurs, Mrs Fajon and Mrs Ludford for their work on visa liberalisation for Western Balkans.
  The Western Balkans have recently gone through a traumatic period of war.
  Europe and the European Union are going through the longest peacetime period in history.
  Visa-free travel is an important step towards fully-fledged membership of the EU.
  However, not all Balkan countries are eligible to receive the visa PERSON244 welcomes the proposal to provide visa-free travel for Western Balkan States.
  He supports the acceptance of the Joint Declaration.
  He deplores the fact that the Eastern Partnership did not feature any reference to Moldova.
