SUMMARY-
 -The decision to vote on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic regarding EU-Israel relations should be postponed until there is more concrete evidence of good faith on the part of Israel and the The European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, including the rapporteur, voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs de Keyser's report.
  People022 will accept the amendments tabled by the Left to establish a relationship with Israel.
