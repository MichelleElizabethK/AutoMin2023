ATTENDEES : PERSON008


SUMMARY-- As Media Commissioner, I would like to thank the EP and the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for addressing a delicate issue on how marketing and advertising affects equality between men and women.
- Advertising plays an important role in the financing of the media.
- Eva-Britt Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men is not serious.
- Eva-Britt Svensson from the Committee on Gender Equality presents a report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men.
- It reduces the cover price of magazines and newspapers and ensures The European Commission supports the positive recommendations made in the EP report on anti-stereotyping.
- It is PERSON505: Advertising is an integral part of our life and it has an indisputable effect on public's behaviour and the formation of public opinion.
- PERSON513 supports the idea that parents and legal guardians bear great responsibility in the way they deal with children and the business world treats them as important consumers.
- PERSON497 welcomes the report by Mrs Svensson on the negative influence of advertising on human beings.
- She would like to support what is now on the table.
- She does not mention the growing problem of gender discrimination among EU citizens of the Muslim faith.
- The problem with marketing and advertising cannot be ascribed to the media as such.
- The consequences of advertising policy have far-reaching effects on the retention of stereotypes, which means an almost insurmountable obstacle to the changes needed to achieve the defined targets, including the Lisbon targets.
- They think it is better not to interfere with the content of adverts and not to restrict their freedom of expression.
- There is a need to protect children and youths from negative advertising.
- The European People's Party will vote against the amendments to the report on marketing and advertising.
