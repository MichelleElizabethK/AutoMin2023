SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework.
- On 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars The CARS 21 initiative aimed at creating a competitive regulatory system for the EU automotive industry.
- According to the report, Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts, an EU-wide type-approval system for used vehicles, a common regulatory system for the automotive tuning sector, more research money for the automobile industry and a realistic assessment of the CO2 emissions target CARS 21 is the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
- It aims to create a stable, reliable and predictable framework for the development of one of Europe's key industries, the car industry.
- It also aims to give the manufacturers time to prepare themselves for the mandatory requirements to come.
- According to CARS 21, the next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
- 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of bio-fuels.
- The Commission wants to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry.
- Everything that has already come into force by way of Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards will make European motor cars much more expensive.
- The regulations that we will be introducing to give pedestrians better protection will also The compulsory introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive.

- According to PERSON077, the Commission's opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century, there is a need to adapt vehicles and infrastructure and apply technological innovation to make European roads safer.
- There should be an integrated approach to reduce emissions, as proposed by CARS The Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative.
- They would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and they believe it is fundamental to address non-harmonised implementation, the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive.
- They also want The President of the European Parliament, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, congratulates Commissioner Verheugen on the creation of a high-level group, CARS 21, to examine the European automotive industry.

- He supports the introduction of Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles.
- He also supports the set-up The rapporteur proposes to set a new target of 125 g/km of CO2 emissions per tonne by 2015.

- Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, supports The rapporteur has done a lot of work on the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry.

- The European Parliament expressed its opinion that the car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 g/km by 2015.
- The Commission proposed setting emission standards The CARS 21 High Level Group missed the opportunity to put in place a vision of a sustainable automotive industry.
- Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
- In the United States a hydrogen highway is being laid and the market is being prepared for electric PERSON085: Car manufacturing is one of Europe's key industries.
- It employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility.
- It must be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness.
- The car of today is very much the same as that of 100 years ago, but at the same time it is extremely different regarding security, efficiency and its effect on the environment.

- The rapporteur has misgivings about targets which would be difficult for industry to achieve.
- However, he is PERSON089 thanks rapporteur for his report on CO2 emissions.
- He believes Europe should focus more on research to develop engines that run at a higher temperature and more on developing software for control purposes.
- Mr Chatzimarkakis' report urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets for the automotive industry.
- It follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations, such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions, the need to ensure appropriate lead-times and the protection of Tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage.
