SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Jacek Protasiewicz on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
- The Green Paper on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century was published by the European Parliament.
- MEPs agree that changes in labour law are necessary because of the challenges brought by this century.
- They differ on the extent of the changes and the nature of the regulation In the introductory draft of the report, MEPs highlight the need to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape.
- They also highlight the importance of education and mobility in improving the situation on the European labour market.
- The result of the negotiations and the heated debate on the report concerning the reform of labour law and unemployment in Europe was not completely what MEPs wanted.
- Almost half of the amendments to the report support the approach of creating new jobs.
- The Green Paper on improving labour law was the outcome of consultations and discussions between governments, parliaments, social partners and other interested parties.
- It contains useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by cross-border mobility and international trade.
- The Green The Green Paper on labour law reform proposes: an examination of flexibility and security as two mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality; adopting an approach that, when it comes to developing employment security, takes account of the life cycle; providing basic protection for all workers regardless of the PERSON082: There is a prevailing fear that increased cross-border mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis.
- I welcome Parliament's positive attitude to finding ways of resolving the problem.
- I feel that the report also emphasises the benefits of dialogue between the International Labour Organisation PERSON084: Mr President, I am pleased with the debate on labour law but not with the method.
- I am not opposed to reform of labour law if it leads to more certainty for everyone, including those on the lowest incomes.
- The rapporteur's report is unbalanced, ignores the other perspective for a reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century, and rests on a conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict.
- Modern-day Europe has the spirit, talent and capability to become more competitive, The rapporteur, Mr Protasiewicz, prepared a report on the EU's labour law.
- According to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the best balance between flexibility and security of employment can be achieved through the collective bargaining system and the social dialogue.
- The text adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship that today often not only exist but constitute a need to allow companies at European level to respond to the competitive challenges posed by them on a worldwide scale.
- PERSON089: Madam President, the Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report we have discussed is a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world.
- According to President of the European Commission, Europe undervalues the importance of employment.
- Europe considers employment to be the basis of democracy and social cohesion.
- Europe has its own concept of normal work: stable employment, for an unlimited period, protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions PERSON091: Saving on employment costs and making workers compete for short-term profits does not make the economy grow.
- The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy.
- The employment contract should contain rules and rights that cannot be delegated to others or replaced by external action.
- MEPs The British Conservative Party wants to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and withdraw the United Kingdom from EU employment and social legislation.
- The European Commission's proposals on modernising labour law and its first draft report show a belated recognition that intrusive and inflexible labour
