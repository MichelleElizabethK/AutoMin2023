SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report by Jan Mulder and Lutz Goepel on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- Lutz Goepel and Jan Mulder are the rapporteurs of the reports on the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's opposition to it.
- According to the Mulder report on the proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, there was no proper impact assessment.
- The proposal for optional cofinancing meets the expectations of the Council.
- However, the proposal for non-cofinancing for Portugal should be an exception in rural The President has postponed the debate on agriculture until later.
- The proposal to shift 20% of agricultural direct payments from the first pillar of CAP to the second pillar has been rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- As part of the Budget compromise, all the institutions agreed that all the Community's outgoings, among them the post-2013 agricultural expenditure, should be subject to review and Parliament will play a full part in this process from an early stage.
- Now Parliament has no option but to kill The evaluations confirm that mandatory modulation would result in a reduction of payments by one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with strategy laid down at Community level, and the renationalisation of agriculture policy is paid for entirely from Community funds Rural areas have financial problems.
- BÃ¶ge's proposal does not address these problems.
- The Council should reject it.
- According to the report of the House's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, additional aid for rural development in Portugal was justified as part of a package of measures nodded through by the Council in December.
- It was not ideal and should remain an exception, but it was agreed on for other countries The European Parliament will vote against the Commission proposals on voluntary modulation.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets reject the draft of the Commission's proposal on rural development.
- The average earnings of farmers in my constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10 000, or EUR 14 000.
- Prime Minister Blair proposes to cut 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of 5% compulsory modulation that already exists and 8% that will be deducted for The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the Commission's proposal on rural development policy.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- This would be an arbitrary additional tax on farmers.
- It would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned.
- The Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement The European Parliament has rejected the proposal for the second pillar of the European Union's agricultural policy.
- The proposal for medium-term financial planning has been watered down to 20%.
- People169 and People170 want the Commission to reconsider the proposal.
- They want compulsory modulation, accompanied by capping and by fair redistribution of these funds.
- The proposed modulation of agricultural policy affects both the old and the new Member States.
- The modulation impairs the vision of stable agricultural rules until 2013.
- New Member States fear a partial re-nationalisation of the agricultural policy.
- The debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments highlights the differences between the old and the new Member States' understandings of the common agricultural policy.
- Rejecting the Commission's proposal is the most appropriate course of action.
- The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation of CAP amounts to a further step towards renationalising the CAP and dismantling the communitisation of agricultural policy.
- My country returns more money to Brussels than any other country and has the largest balance between the first and second pillars.
- Portugal Portugal will not have to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
- Rural development policy offers a range of mechanisms which make it possible to influence the differing needs of European farmers.
- As permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds, I regret that the European Parliament is being forced to change the ceilings on EAFRD development support in order to bring them in line with the Council's decisions.
- I also wish to express our attachment to the fundamental principles of rural development policy The proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' of direct payments to agriculture will lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers, which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union.
- Polish MEPs warned of the consequences of The proposal to hijack 20% or even 25% of farmers' single farm payments is bad for the farmers and will turn them against each other.
- It will place United Kingdom farmers in an impossible position.
- It is not the farmers' fault that the UK Government has negotiated such a miserable The proposal for a 20% additional modulation for the second pillar of the European Union's Rural Development Programme (RDP) is unacceptable and should be rejected.
- Instead, rapporteur rapporteur proposes an identical rate of compulsory modulation.
- The UK delegation in the group is concerned about the current level of rural development funding in the EU.
- They call on the Commission to address the imbalances as a matter of urgency.
- The President of Poland wants to maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%.
- The arguments put forward by the European Commission are unconvincing and do not conform to the principles of the CAP.
- The new Member States need more The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of a number of Council decisions aimed at compensating farmers who have been manifestly penalised under the CAP.
- Goepel's report is regrettable as it is The President of the European Parliament urges the Commissioner to abandon the proposal and come up with a new one.
- The use of the current Community payments and the decision of the European Council taken in December 2005, according to which Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement, raises serious questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
- In future no Member State should benefit from special treatment solely to The proposal concerning voluntary modulation and market support measures is bad and will be rejected by the House.
- The proposal to cut 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development is unacceptable, fragmentary, anti-European, selfish and hypocritical.
- It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which was the only policy that united European producers.
- The Spanish Government's proposal PERSON188 missed the debate on voluntary modulation of farmers' money.
- If the European Parliament rejects the Commission's proposal, he will raise the issue with his fellow Commissioners.
