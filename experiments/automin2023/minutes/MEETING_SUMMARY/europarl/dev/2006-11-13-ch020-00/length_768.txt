SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report by Jan Mulder and Lutz Goepel on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- According to the Commission proposal, which was presented to the European Council last December, Member States could transfer funds from the common agricultural policy into the second pillar of the budget to reinforce the rural development budget.
- The Commission proposes optional cofinancing as a compromise to meet the expectations of the Council The President, Commissioner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have a debate on the reorientation of the Community budget.
- The European Parliament has voted in favour of mandatory modulation of payments to farmers.
- The proposal amounts to a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The Council has not responded to the concerns of farmers.
- Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with strategy The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved additional aid for rural development in Portugal.
- It was part of a package of measures nodded through by the Council in December.
- The committee also approved the financial perspectives which contain precise figures for this and other market measures in the framework of The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets reject the draft of the Commission's proposal on rural development.
- The average earnings of farmers in my constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10 000, or EUR 14 000.
- Prime Minister Blair proposes to cut 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of 5% compulsory modulation that already exists and 8% that will be deducted for The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the Commission's proposal on rural development policy.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- This would be an arbitrary additional tax on farmers.
- It would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned.
- The Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement The European Parliament rejects the proposal for the second pillar and rural economic development.
- The proposal amounts to a redistribution of EU funds for agriculture.
- PERSON170: He supports the Commission's proposal to exempt Portugal from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement.
- He also supports the Goepel report on direct payments.
- The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation of CAP amounts to a further step towards renationalising the CAP and dismantling the communitisation of agricultural policy.
- My country returns more money to Brussels than any other country and has the largest balance between the first and second pillars.
- Portugal PERSON174: Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million shows solidarity.
- The proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' of direct payments to agriculture will lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers, which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union.
- Polish MEPs warned of the consequences of The proposal to hijack 20% or even 25% of farmers' single farm payments is bad for the farmers and will turn them against each other.
- It will place United Kingdom farmers in an impossible position.
- It is not the farmers' fault that the UK Government has negotiated such a miserable The proposal for additional modulation for the second pillar of the European Union's Rural Development Programme (RDP) is unacceptable and should be rejected.
- There should be an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all the Member States.
- PERSON181: Mr President, in thanking both of our colleagues for their work, I would like to focus more closely on Mr Mulder's report on the mechanism of funding designated for areas inhabited by 20% of the population of the European Union.
- The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of a number of Council decisions aimed at compensating farmers who have been manifestly penalised under the CAP.
- Goepel's report is regrettable as it is The President of the European Parliament urges the Commissioner to abandon the proposal and come up with a new one.
- PERSON185: Mr President, the use of the current Community payments and the decision of the European Council taken in December 2005, according to which Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement, raises serious questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
- The proposal to cut 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development is unacceptable, fragmentary, anti-European, selfish and hypocritical.
- It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy.
- If the European Parliament rejects the proposal, I intend to raise the issue with
