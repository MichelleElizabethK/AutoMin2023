SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report by Jan Mulder on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development regarding a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( The President, Commissioner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have a debate on the reorientation of the Community budget.
- The European Parliament has voted in favour of mandatory modulation of payments to farmers.
- The proposal amounts to a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The Council has not responded to the concerns of farmers.
- Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with strategy The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of additional aid for rural development in Portugal.
- The Committee on Budgets voted against the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the Commission's proposal on rural development policy.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- This would be an arbitrary additional tax on farmers.
- It would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned.
- The Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement The European Parliament rejects the Commission's proposal for the second pillar and rural economic development.
- Portugal should be excluded from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million.
- According to the participants in the debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments, there are differences between the old and the new Member States' understanding of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
- New Member States would like to adopt 20% modulation, whereas the old ones would like it to be 75 Portugal will not have to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
- Rural development policy offers a range of mechanisms which make it possible to influence the differing needs of European farmers.
- The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers PERSON177 congratulates Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports.
- He and his colleague reject the proposal to reduce direct payments to farmers by up to one third.
- They are worried that it will turn farmers and other rural society against each other.
- The proposal for additional modulation for the second pillar of the European Union's Rural Development Fund is unacceptable and should be rejected.
- There should be an identical rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States.
- PERSON182: In order to keep European agriculture competitive, we must maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%.
- The European Parliament rejects the proposal of the Commissioner.
- It raises serious questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
- It would be a good solution to finance the direct payments in the first pillar, but it would cause serious financing problems for new Member States, which are in a strained budgetary situation The European Parliament is debating a proposal on rural development.
- The proposal proposes cutting 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development and renationalising the common agricultural policy.
