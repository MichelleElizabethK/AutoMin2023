SUMMARY
- The next items on the agenda are the joint debate on the report by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann and Aldis Kušķis on the thematic strategy for protection and preservation of the marine environment C6 - 0346/2005.
- The European Commission is launching a debate on the thematic strategy for protecting and preserving the marine environment and on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive.
- Europe's seas and oceans cover 3 million square kilometres, the same area as mainland Europe.
- Marine ecosystems play a key role in climate and weather patterns.
- Nutrient The proposed Marine Strategy Directive aims to achieve 'good environmental status' in the EU marine environment by 2021.
- This date will coincide with the first review of River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive.
- The directive establishes European Marine Regions.
- In the first phase, Member States will develop a marine strategy for the seas in each of their regions.
- In the second phase, they will work with their regional partners to develop and implement measures aimed at achieving good environmental status.
- The seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state.
- There is a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that the Commission has presented and the Parliament wishes to enhance.
- The environment of the seas plays a decisive role in people's lives and they play a major Parliament would like the requirement for results to be far more present and stronger.
- They would also like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision.
- Finally, they advocate the creation of marine protected areas.
- According to PERSON092, they would like to include the Black Sea and Arctic in the document.
- They would like the outermost regions of the Union to become the subject of an appropriate strategy.
- The President of the European Parliament, MEP PERSON093, is happy with the report on the thematic strategy for the protection and preservation of the marine environment.
- The thematic strategy on marine protection is decided on under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
- The EU marine strategy directive will be an important new instrument in integrating the existing approaches.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has made the environmental protection directive stronger, more ambitious and effective.
- The time limits and schedules for achieving good environmental status have been tightened up.
- The Black Sea has been added as one marine region in the directive.
- According to Commissioner Borg and Dimas, the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status.
- The money budgeted for this action is insufficient and fishermen must be made partners in the effort.
- The directive must give fisheries its proper place and must put them at the The rapporteur has done an important work for the EU.
- The Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Mr Borg, organised a conference on maritime transport safety in my home town of Turku.
- Now the Commission and all of us need to work closely with Russia to save the Baltic The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the Commission proposal for a directive in the field of Marine Environmental Policy and a Marine Strategy.
- Europe's seas should be able to achieve good ecological status within a specific period of time.
- To achieve good status, we need to establish sufficiently stringent conservation objectives to prevent deterioration There is strong support in this House for the principles behind the Commission's marine strategy and for the legislation.
- However, there are some weaknesses within the Commission itself and divisions within its member states.
- The rapporteurs' report improves the Commission's proposal by demanding that good environmental status be achieved by 2017 instead of 2021, and the targets are made binding.
- Member States must assume their responsibility for setting up more marine reserves.
- The marine environment is under daily threat.
- Maritime pollution, climate change, shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health.
- The directive is an important step towards improving health and restoring the seas.
- President, Commissioner, I urge you to support the The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and the appropriate amendments that would improve it is welcome.
- The European Union has territorial waters greater than its entire territory, with 1 200 ports, and 90% of its exports are transported by sea.
- The European Union is committed to maximising the potential of its indigenous energy resources.
- However, certain amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Parliament should support the changes backed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- The group of liberals and Democrats for Europe has prepared a number of amendments aimed at increasing the level of ambition, bringing stricter timetables about, strengthening cooperation with third countries such as Russia and plugging loopholes in the legislation.
- The European Union has 68 000 km of coastline while Scotland has 11 000 km.
- 70% of the population lives within 10 km of the sea.
- The idea that Member States should determine what good environmental status is in waters under their jurisdiction and work with their neighbours to improve it makes sense.
- The European Union has a fragmentary approach to protecting the marine environment.
- The aim of the thematic strategy on the protection and conservation of the environment and the marine strategy directive is to achieve a good environmental status of the European Union by 2021.
- However, if we take into account the more Mrs Lienemann has achieved a Directive on activities at sea.
- She worked with experts and she was open to many suggestions.
- However, she left out many aspects that need to be developed in the future.
- Mrs Lienemann congratulates Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen on her complete and detailed work on the proposed directive on marine environment protection.
- She calls for the deadlines for attaining the targets of the proposed Directive to be brought forward to 2017.
- Mrs Lienemann congratulates Mr Kušķis and Mr Kuŷis on their excellent reports on the protection of the marine environment.
- Mrs Lienemann has written a report on the future of fish in the seas and oceans surrounding the European Union.
- She recommends setting up fish reserves and introducing sustainable fishing methods.
- She also recommends purifying ballast water.
- The planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany should not be laid on the bed of the Baltic Sea, because it poses a threat to the environment and to fishing.
- The Commission's proposed timetable for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Directive is ambitious.
- It would not be practical to call on Member States to achieve good environmental status by 2021 as proposed by the Committee on the Environment.
- The Commission is prepared to support the insertion of an article stressing the importance of marine protected areas (Amendments 27, 39, 62 and 72).
- It is also prepared to back the idea that in order to meet the objectives of the Directive it may be necessary to create further protected areas or The Commission has problems with the list of definitions proposed by the Committee on the Environment.
- Many of these definitions are based on the factors influencing the marine environment and the threats to it, rather than the quality of the ecosystem.
- In addition, some seas have not been included, as in the case of There is a great need to improve the condition of the marine environment in Europe.
- Europe is surrounded by four seas and two oceans.
