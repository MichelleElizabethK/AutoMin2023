- PERSON079 asks for the floor as he is not quite sure what is going on.
- The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, which accompanies the directive, aims to reduce the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from the use of pesticides.
- It proposes a 50% reduction in the most dangerous substances that are, if used in certain large quantities Parliament's Environment Committee has proposed a report on the regulation of pesticides in Europe.
- The main objectives of the regulation are eradication of high-risk pesticides and better protection of sensitive groups.
- PERSON084 and PERSON083 give President Obama their opinion on the use of pesticides.
- The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market is drafted.
- It is important to strike a balance between interests: on the one hand, there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face.
- The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
- Member States should set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities The President of the European Parliament, Dimitrios Kyprianou, is defending a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and force them to reduce their levels of consumer protection.

- They co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application The rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, has produced a report on the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
- PERSON095: In the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns and the interests of producers and consumers.
- I am sceptical about the policy based on reducing use.
- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been PERSON098 is disappointed that representatives of the agricultural sector were not involved in the debate on pesticides.
- He believes strict rules should be established to regulate the placing of these products on the market and promote research programmes on biological means of pest control.

- Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater.
- The proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation PERSON104: Madam President, I have been stressing the importance of this evening's debate because what we have at stake here is nothing less than Europe's future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that causes too much pollution and towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity.
- PERSON108: Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for you to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and put some of it into effect immediately.
- UKIP will vote against the EU's pestilent regulations.

- He supports the proposal for a risk-based assessment, which is based on science and will prove workable for Member States.
- He also supports the 10-metre buffer There are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today.
- For example, there is a common European reduction target of 20%, but it may mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others.
- The national reduction targets will be established on the basis of national action The 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would affect 800 000 hectares of farmland, 35% of agricultural area in the Netherlands.
- It would also mean that growers would have to issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close The key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
- Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
- Member States should encourage rational measures and not discourage farmers.

- Therefore, when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides, we have to keep in mind what is in the According to a consultation with experts, some of the proposed changes to EU Directive 91/414/EEC and Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are unworkable.
