SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the report by Christa Klaß, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides.
- The European Parliament voted on the thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive on reducing the risks and dependence on pesticides.
- According to the thematic strategy, special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network.
- The European Parliament is debating the amendment to the directive on plant protection products.
- The current law on this topic dates from 1991.
- The proposal is aimed at creating a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU.
- The procedure will be shorter and more efficient.
- Member States will no longer be working in isolation.
- Regulatory harmonisation will be the rule rather than the exception.
- The changes to data protection will The Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides is welcome.
- Differing rules in the European Union create divergent safety standards and distort competition.
- The global population is growing and food is becoming scarcer.
- Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place According to Directive No.
- 078, the use of plant protection agents on farmland and in public spaces is restricted to a certain percentage.
- According to Commissioner, buffer strips next to water bodies serve no purpose.
- The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment.
- Plant protection products are expensive and the Commission's approach is the right one.
- Commissioner, I ask for your support.
- PERSON079 asks for the floor as he is not quite sure what is going on.
- The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, which accompanies the directive, responds to the fact that the risks from pesticide use are not decreasing.
- It proposes a 50% reduction in the most dangerous substances and a frequency of application index for other pesticides.
- The Thematic Strategy and the Directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides.
- They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country.
- Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along waterc Parliament's Environment Committee has proposed a report on the regulation of pesticides in Europe.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposes strict substitution criteria and better protection of sensitive groups.
- According to Directive 2006/215, food products that do not comply with Directive 2005/67/EC regarding pesticide labelling must have an indication to that effect.
- The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when.
- The Environment Committee came out against dividing Europe into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types.
- There are no intergovernmental agreements to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences within the defined zones.
- According to President Obama, Europe needs to reduce set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production.

- PERSON086 argues against the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would require farmers to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before applying plant protection products.
- He also rejects the Commission's proposal to create 27 national licensing zones.
- The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face.
- The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
- Member States should set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities The President of the European Parliament, Kyprianou, is defending a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and reduce their levels of consumer protection.
- In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted.
- If the proposal is implemented, If the Commission's proposals are implemented, every country will approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
- It should not be the EU's task to force countries to use more pesticides.
- Europe should establish a general reduction target for all substances.
- There is a need to harmonise the rules on pesticide-related risks in order to reduce their use across the Union.
- The ALDE Group, which is part of the European Commission, has proposed a number of amendments to make the text more easily applicable.

- For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment rather than fixing a The European Union is trying to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment.
- However, in past the quality of pesticides was much worse, they were used in much higher doses, and, as a result, the pollution in our environment is a consequence of activities in years past.
- Therefore, the EU The European Parliament voted in favour of the 'pesticides package' despite concerns raised by ordinary people.
- The rapporteur on the sustainable use of pesticides in Europe, Mrs Belohorská, has produced a report on her Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides in Europe.
- In the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand.

- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and The EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use.
- The EU support schemes have been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.
- PERSON097 will vote against the 10-metre limit on pesticides.

- Therefore, Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays in The proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union and unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.
- This evening's debate is about Europe's farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that causes too much pollution and towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity.
- Public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides.
- PERSON105 is in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment and the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health.

- The Slovak Republic applies less than 1 kg of pesticides per hect Parliamentarians want to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and put some of it into effect immediately.
- They want a reduction in the quantity of pesticides, a risk-based approach, non-spray zones around watercourses and a voluntary mutual recognition between The European Commission and Member States should provide periodic training and advisory and educational programmes financed at least in part by the companies that manufacture pesticides.

- They aim to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities.
- There are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from other members of the European Parliament concerning the reduction of pesticide use.
- According to PERSON117, the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work.
- PERSON117 supports Erna Hennicot-Schoepges' proposal.
- Member States should be allowed to refuse different preparations even if other countries have given them the green light.
