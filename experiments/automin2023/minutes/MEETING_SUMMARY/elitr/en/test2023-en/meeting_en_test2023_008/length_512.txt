  PROJECT2 overlooked the Portuguese data.

  She has not responded to the question by email yet.
 -PERSON6 will ask another researcher in Brazil if she can help her with finding conferences and master thesis repositories.
 -PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON1 and PERSON2 agree that their system is too good and they should try testing it in the cross domain scenario.
  Person3 would like to extract the European data completely from the training set, but they want to avoid retraining the model.
  Person PERSON1, Dusan and PERSON3 are going to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer.
 -PERSON1, PERSON2 and PERSON3 want to create a test set for the PROJECT1 project.
 -PERSON1 will open the document PROJECT1 test set.
  There is no specific index for this repository.
  There are two translations into Czech and one into German.
  In the test set part IWSLT nonative testset, there is an English, a German and a Czech PERSON2 explains to PERSON1 how to prepare a proper sub-lease agreement in Czech.
 -PERSON1 and PERSON2 explain to PERSON4 how to extract sentences from WMT PROJECT1 test set for Bles core evaluation.
 -PERSON4 should use the documents from the spoken ones and the written ones sao domain speeches.
 -PERSON6 offers help with the navigation.
 -PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON5 and PERSON6 would like to get together and work on the English Portuguese data.
  The data from PERSON8 will be used for experiments.
 -PERSON1, Person3, Person4, Person5, Person6 and Person7 are going to meet on Monday after the school to discuss the data.
