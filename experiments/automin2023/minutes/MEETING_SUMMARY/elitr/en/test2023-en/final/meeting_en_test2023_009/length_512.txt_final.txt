PERSON1, who created the project, put the editable L in comment on the second line of the document so that later on one can always find the link.
PERSON1 and PERSON3 want to make sure they have dedicated data sets for English and Portugese within their PROJECT2 asset.
PERSON3 will soon put in all the results and try to figure out some kind of explanation for them.
Person10 will try to set up a conference call with PERSON12 to discuss the data set.
PERSON10 wants to make sure in the concatenation settings that there is a special token to distinguish between the source and the context of a sentence and the other sentence.
PERSON1 is preparing a training model for negative constant along with the input to train an English-Portugese model.
PERSON10 wants to make sure there is an option to go after summer.
PERSON8 tried to do it in two different ways.
PERSON5, who is responsible for organizing the meeting, doesn't know if the link from Organization 1 is working.
PERSON10 explains to PERSON2 that the se two encoder setting works with the multi-model translation but it doesn't work with the concatenation.
PERSON3 is PERSON3 is preparing data sets for the PROJECT2 experiments.
PERSON3 wants to come here before summer or during the holiday.
PERSON3 will write the results into the paper.
PERSON8 is in Slovakia, he's moving to Prague tomorrow and going to the PCR test on Wednesday.
PERSON8's message to the Organizing Committee3 has not received a response.
PERSON1, PERSON2, PERSON8 and PERSON10 discuss the pros and cons of encoding two copies of the same sentence.
PERSON5 shared the link into chat.
The next week he has a Hacathon on universal coreference with PERSON The second encoder does not really encode the context, but it does introduce some noise which helps the robustness of the data set.
The method works but it's far from getting correct core, correct force from of the consraints.
They will think about April as suggested by PERSON1.
They are going to limit the experiments to only a sentence There is a DEMO deadline on Friday the fifteenth of January, and then there is ACL deadline at the end of the month.
They also want to have a dedicated English to Portugese model.
Two encoders work the same with the random sentences as with the correct ones.
