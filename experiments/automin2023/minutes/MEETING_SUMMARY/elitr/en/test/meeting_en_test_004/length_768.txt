- The offline ASR is reasonably close to what online ASR produces.
- The segmentation is fine, but the moduls are not trained on the segmentation.
- PERSON14 is not sure how close it will be, but it works fine.
- The machine translation quality is not affected by mismatching segmentation between the training mode and the operation mode.
- The machine translation system is trained on the current state of the art.
- PERSON13, PERSON14, PERSON10, PERSON5, PERSON6 and PERSON7 are working on a project.
- The demo is terrible, they need to improve it and redo the segmentation worker.

- If one of the cabins is bad, the machine translation will be stopped.
- If the other cabins are PERSON10 explains to PERSON3 how the presentation platform works.
