ATTENDEES : PERSON10, PERSON13, PERSON14, PERSON3, PERSON7


SUMMARY
- PERSON10, PERSON15, PERSON6, PERSON8 and PERSON13 are on a conference call.
- They are discussing the presentation platform by PERSON15 and colleagues.
- PERSON3 is working on a presentation platform.
- PERSON10 wants to know if there is a text only client or text only version that can emit the subtitles to standard output.
- PERSON2 also proposes another option for the main stage presentation problem.
- PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON7 and PERSON14 are working on a project.
- PERSON14 wants them to write a text client to send text to text worker for testing.
- The KT translation platform doesn't handle batching very well.
- PERSON5 is the only person left who can fix it.
- PERSON3, PERSON14, PERSON6 and PERSON10 worked together this week to find better workarounds.
- PERSON5 needs to test machine translation by looking at the output of the online ASR.
- PERSON10 wants to send the audio files from the ASR to PERSON5 so that he can check the segmentation.
- The offline ASR is different from the online one.
- The segmentation is fine, but the moduls are not trained on it.
- PERSON10, PERSON13 and PERSON14 are working on an ASR integration project.
- They are trying to create a command line file that resembles the output of the ASR.
- There are offline ASR systems and online mediator.
- The machine translation quality is not affected by mismatching segmentation between the training mode and the operation mode.
- The models for the mediator are not trained on ASR, on actual ASR output at all.
- It is hard to get a large enough sample of online ASR to fine tune PERSON14 explains to PERSON13 and PERSON10 that they have to get parallel data.
- They have 15000 minds of lecture that were manually translated.
- They need to update and redo the segmentation worker.
- They also need to check if the line oriented output is similar to PERSON10 is trying to set up the microphone level.
- The chat is filling up with messages but the ASR worker is not available.
- There is a bug in the batch mode.
- The debugger is still on the list for downloading the document.
- People will focus on the batch operation PERSON7 created a text to text client, but it didn't work.
- The segmentation workers expect data of type unsegmented text.
- The CTM is the word level output of ASR.
- The ASR workers are reliable to debug it.
- The segmentation workers in ORGANIZATION5 do not work with the CTM client.
- Therefore, in order to test the machine translation, they always have to rely on some ASR worker being available.
- ORGANIZATION5 needs to solve the problem before next Friday.
- PERSON3 will be back next week and they will arrange some hands-on debugging session so that he can help with fixing the bug.
- The ASR output in chat does not have any tags other than words.
- There is also the ORGANIZATION2 platform mediator which performs most of the processing.
- Organization ORGANIZATION2 handles unsegmented text only after it comes out of the segmentor.
- PERSON14 explains the structure of the SLT ORGANIZATION5 to PERSON10 and PERSON3.
- PERSON5, PERSON10, PERSON13, PERSON14 and PERSON7 are going to have a session, session with and PERSON15 next week to discuss the bugs in the project.
- Everyone will be speaking their non-native English.
- There will be four cabins with interpreters, students of interpretation, and one floor signal, which will be the original signal, will have 1 or 2 re-speakers, into Czech and from that will have interpretation into German.
- PERSON3 explains to PERSON10 how to improve the presentation platform.
- Killing the client is useful only to keep all the clients up and running and streaming audio.
- If the presentation platform already had a man in the middle, then it would be possible to turn off the stream of input.
- If it does not, then the source would be killed.
- For June there will be no preview of the subtitle.
- The selection of the stream should be available.
- There will be more people monitoring the presentation platform at the same time, so they could simultaneously make decisions.
- PERSON3 explains to PERSON10 how the presentation platform works.
- PERSON10 is the integrator of the project.
- PERSON3 is a software developer.
- ORGANIZATION1 can order whatever devices they want for the people, but they don't believe 400 people can receive the signal of their WiFi reasonably well.
- ORGANIZATION2 can organise the people by language, but PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON13 will talk again next Friday.
- They will ship PROJECT1 models to PERSON5 and then or they should test the PERSON5 workers with their PROJECT2 model.
