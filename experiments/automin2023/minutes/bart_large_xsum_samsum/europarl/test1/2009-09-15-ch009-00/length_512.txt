SUMMARY
- Kinga GÃ¶ncz, a former Hungarian Foreign Minister, was insulted in the debate this morning by Krisztina Morvai from the fascist Jobbik party.
- The party represented by Krisztina Morvai set up a paramilitary unit in 2006 and used it to intimidate the peaceful public majority.
- The paramilitary unit was recently disbanded by the courts, but an MEP from this party wore the uniform of this organisation in this chamber during the July session.
