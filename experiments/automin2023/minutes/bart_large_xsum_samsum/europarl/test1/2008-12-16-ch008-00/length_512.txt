SUMMARY
- In the debate with Mr Sarkozy this morning, I talked about the European Union's attitude towards democracy.
- Martin Schulz made disparaging and derogatory comments about the leader of the Socialist Group, Martin, in June this year.
- He was allowed by the President, PÃ¶ttering, Nigel Farage has accused me of saying that a "no" vote will lead to fascism.
- I have never said that and neither has Martin Schulz.
- I do not believe that a 'no' vote by any population - like the Irish population - leads to fascism, but I do
