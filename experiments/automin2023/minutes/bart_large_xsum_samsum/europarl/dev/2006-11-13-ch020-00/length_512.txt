- Now the Council has decided to According to the evaluations, mandatory modulation would result in a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The evaluations confirm that there will be a massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against farmers concerned.

- New Member States will not be able to afford a partial re-nationalisation of their agricultural policy.
- Therefore, they need clear and stable rules for Today's debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments highlights the different ways in which the old and the new Member States understand the common agricultural policy.
- Re-nationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy was introduced in the new member states, which in 2004 paid as much as 75% to the The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States, depending on the percentages of modulation that they choose to adopt.
