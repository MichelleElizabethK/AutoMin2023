SUMMARY
- The next item is the report (A6-0513) by Mr Costa on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions.
- The European Parliament and the Council are going to adopt the 'omnibus' proposal for a regulation amending both Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions and Regulation No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.
- The basic Regulation dates back to 1960, when our countries were separate, and when rules on hygiene and food could mask discrimination and obstacles to competition.
- It is time to separate out the transport rules, which are easier to accept and, I hope, to implement.
- The proposal for a Regulation amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions has been in force since 1960.
- It requires land, rail or waterborne freight carriers operating within the Community to provide information on their rates, applicable agreements, terms of carriage and the necessary documentation PERSON125 congratulates the Commission on its report on cutting regulation.
- PERSON126 is in favour of the proposal to limit unnecessary paperwork for small businesses with 10 employees or less.
- PERSON127 wants to repeat what he said in committee and repeat it tomorrow in the hope of achieving the same outcome
