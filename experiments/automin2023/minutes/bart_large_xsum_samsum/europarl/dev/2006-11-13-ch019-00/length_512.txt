SUMMARY
- The next item is the oral question to the Commission on milk quotas by Duarte Freitas, Carmen Fraga Estévez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Esther Herranz García, Elisabeth Jeggle, Albert Jan Maat, Mairead McGuinness, Francisco José Mill The EU's milk quota system provides some kind of stability for the European market.
- Quota levels per Member State are fixed until 31 March 2015.
- After that date, in the absence of a proposal from the Commission and a decision taken in the Council, the system of milk quotas will end The current quota system will expire on 31 March 2015.
- If the Council takes a decision to continue the quota system after 2015, this should allow for a gradual transition from the current rules to a scenario without production limits.
- However, it's still too early to take the appropriate measures.
- The dairy market The decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions that are heavily dependent on milk and on the quotas.
- If we want to carry on having a quota, then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it, exactly in the same way The Christian Democrats and European Democrats are against the abolition or liberalisation of milk production quotas before 2015.
- They are in favour of controlling milk production after 2015 under the current preconditions, which often create oligopolies in the sector.
- They want a timely consultation with the European Parliament.
- The President wants to know the Commission's view on the quota system for dairy products.
- The current situation is different from the one in 1984 when the quota was introduced.
- It would be better to phase out the quota over a period of time.
- The Commissioner's position on the milk quota system is worrying.
- She suggests that they might be dismantled by 2015.
- According to the author of the question, the size of the quotas should be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity.
- The President asks the Commissioner to clarify the situation concerning milk quotas.
- The European Christian Democrats' initiative proposes that milk quotas should be tradable internationally and that they should be lowered when the quota is being used but not when it is not.
- They also propose levelling the quota at European level.
- Finally, they advocate an effective use of European funds for rural The mid-term reform of the CAP was announced as an intermediary review, but it has been one of the most significant reforms that the policy has undergone since it began.
- Parliament voted in favour of extending the current rules to the 2014-2015 financial year, in accordance with the Commission's The European Commission wants to review the common agricultural policy, and with it milk quotas.
- Milk production is heavily invested and requires a lot of capital.
- The current system has resulted in a balanced framework for the farmer in which to engage in production, price fluctuations have been small and the market stable The new Member States benefit the least from the common agricultural policy.
- Polish farmers are still struggling with the milk quotas, which are several million tonnes too low, and they have to pay fines for over-production of milk until they are to be lifted in 2015.
- The producers of Galicia are concerned about possible changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system.
- They ask the European Commission to maintain the current quota system and to prepare a transition period prior to the removal of quotas in 2015.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament held an important seminar on the common agricultural policy last week in Brussels.
- According to the group, the Commission honours its agreements and the arrangements fixed until 2014.
- Quotas are in place until 2015, but they have outlived their usefulness.
- In 2015 there will be a soft landing and when the time comes for quotas to disappear, the soft landing should come into place.
- The European countryside and European farmers and livestock breeders need some certainty.
- The Brussels Agreement in 2002 provided that certainty, and in exchange for it, Member States tolerated a reform of the CAP that required serious sacrifices for the rural world, especially for the 'cohesion countries'.
- The system of milk The debate in the House on dairy quotas is intensifying.
- The current system is an archaic one which inhibits the development of the dairy sector and makes it less competitive on the world market.
- It is opposed by countries which have unfavourable natural conditions for dairy production.
- Many people assert that According to the Farmers' Journal, there are five key points that the Commission has in mind: gradually increasing quotas from the health check onwards, reducing super-levy costs to Member States, balancing quotas across the European Union, reducing cross-border trading and reducing the value of quotas in The President, Mr Freitas, and the Commissioner are taking part in a debate on the abolition of dairy quotas and set-aside.
- The President wants the Commissioner to clarify whether phasing out of the current arrangements can begin before 2015 or from 2015.
- The quota system was introduced in 1984 at a time when farmers wanted to maintain high prices for their products.
- It was decided to increase quotas and reduce prices.
- It will expire in 2015.
- There will be a health check as part of the 2003 CAP reform.
- The report will be published at the end The debate is closed.
- The Commission is preparing to reform the organisation of the milk market, an important element of which would be the abolition of milk quotas.
- Hungary would find it unacceptable any transformation of the quota system that involved transferring the quotas of countries that make less use of them to those The current milk quota system allows for a greater volume of milk production than what the EU needs.
- From 2007 on, direct payments to milk producers have to be kept separate from production.
- The current system will remain in force until 2014-15.
