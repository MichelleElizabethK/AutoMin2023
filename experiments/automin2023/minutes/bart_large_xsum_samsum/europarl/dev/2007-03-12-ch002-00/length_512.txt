SUMMARY
- A ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was held here this afternoon before the plenary sitting.
- The chairman of the group that organised it had no advance notice of it.
- The President of this House wants to check if the procedure was the same as it was last year.
- Last year, he presided from 3 p.m. onwards and wanted to do so until half past three, but the sitting dragged on longer because of the punctuality of the young people
