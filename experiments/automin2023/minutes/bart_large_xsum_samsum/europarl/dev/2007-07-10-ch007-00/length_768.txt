SUMMARY
- Jacek Protasiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century, has presented his report to the European Parliament.
- There is broad agreement that changes in labour law are necessary because of the challenges In the introductory draft of the report, I proposed to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape.
- It also proposed clauses giving a positive assessment of the influence of 'atypical' forms of employment on job creation in the European Union and challenged The Green Paper on improving labour law was an opportunity for discussion on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
- The quality of responses to the Green Paper was astonishing.
- The Green Paper fully recognises the Member States' competence in labour law and their own There were sharp divisions during the negotiations on the Green Paper.
- The report in principle advocates: an examination of flexibility and security as two mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality; adopting an approach that, when it comes to developing employment security, takes account of the life cycle; PERSON084 is pleased with the work carried out by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but not with the method.
- PERSON085 is critical of the Commission's Green Paper on employment policies.
- The rapporteur Protasiewicz's report is unbalanced, it ignores the other perspective for a reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century, it rests on a conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict and ignores the need for trust and cooperation between the sides The rapporteur, Mr Protasiewicz, prepared a report on employment contracts.
- According to the report, there has been a clear increase in the use of atypical employment contracts, but this is also a sign of companies wanting to circumvent labour law and their social obligations.
- The Socialist PERSON088 and her political group will vote in favour of the report in tomorrow's voting.
- The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of time today.
- The Commission's Green Paper on workers' rights has disappointed the House.
- The House has made a clear amendment that worker's rights are not exclusive and apply to all employees, regardless of their collective bargaining situation The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise, it has ambiguous points, but important elements.
- The amendments to it would be a breach of the compromise agreed on in committee.
- Europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and Europe has its own concept of The rapporteur's first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and reduce regulations meant to protect workers.
- The second draft was more acceptable, but still restrictive.
- The debate is suspended and will resume at 3 pm.
