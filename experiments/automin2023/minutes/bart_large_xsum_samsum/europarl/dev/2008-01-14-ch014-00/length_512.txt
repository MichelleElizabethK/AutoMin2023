SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework.
- On 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger The CARS 21 High Level Group was set up by the Commission in 2005 to draw up proposals for a future regulatory framework for the EU automotive industry.
- The members of the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have drawn up a list of 89 proposals.
- According to the report, Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts, an EU-wide type-approval system for used vehicles, a common regulatory system for the automotive tuning sector, a more simplified system for regulating the used vehicles acquired within the EU and a realistic assessment CARS 21 is the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
- CARS 21 is a long-term, stable framework for the development of one of Europe's key industries, the car industry.
- It is a key industry for technological development, for growth and, last but not least, The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
- 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of bio-fuels.
- The Commission wants to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry.
- Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards will make European motor cars much more expensive.
- The regulations that will be introduced to give pedestrians better protection will also cost a lot of money.
- The compulsory introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive.
- The small and medium-sized vehicle market is under attack from international competitors.
- If the steel industry were to move out of Europe to Kazakhstan, tens of thousands of jobs would be lost.
- PERSON072 drafted the report for the INTA Committee.
- It called for the Commission to ensure as a matter of urgency, and with due care and diligence, that all recommendations are examined to determine their impact on the multilateral stage and on the bilateral agreements.
- The car industry employs 2.3 million people directly and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors, which makes 7% of all the people working in the industrial sector of the Community.
- The Community must take care of those people who could lose their jobs due to structural changes in advance and There are 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars.
- Tata Motors brought out a cut-price motor car that averages five litres per hundred kilometres.
- According to Verheugen, Parliament's report falls behind Chris Davies' because it gives priority to vehicle weight instead of carbon footprint, and because it calls for an integrated target of 125 grams based on vehicle technology.
- There is no mention of energy efficiency in the Commission's proposal or in Ver According to Personal076, Dimas has not done a proper impact assessment of the CARS 21 report.
- He was a member of the High Level Group that produced the report.
- The Parliament is going to endorse most of the recommendations of the report, but the Member States are not participating In his opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century, PERSON077, a member of the European Parliament, makes a few suggestions.
- He deplores the Commission's approach to reducing emissions and promoting biofuels.
- The Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative, but questions Member States' commitment to the integrated approach.
- They would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and they believe it is fundamental to address non-harmonised implementation of End- According to the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, the automotive industry is a source of jobs, competitiveness, growth and innovation, but also of CO2 emissions, research into vehicle technologies and tax incentives to encourage fleet renewal.
- Malcolm Harbour and Garrelt Duin were involved in the CARS 21 High Level Group.
- Malcolm Harbour is a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
- He supports the implementation of Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and the proposal for a Euro 6 standard for The rapporteur proposes a new target of 125 g CO2 emissions per tonne by 2015, which is in line with the vote of this Parliament last October.
- The rapporteur's proposal for a gradual phase-in of penalties after 2012 is inconsistent with the Commission's proposal.
- Michael O The rapporteur's report on emissions reduction in the automotive industry is respectable and realistic.
- The industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields.
- As a shadow rapporteur, I tried to support the report with my amendments.
- The European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, has presented a report on the future of the automotive industry to the European Commission.
- The Commission proposed setting emission standards for new private cars.
- The European Parliament voted by majority vote that the car companies could reach the CO2 Car emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions.
- Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
- The European automotive industry is fighting a rearguard action to emit even more CO2.
- The CARS 21 High Level Group was dominated Car manufacturing is one of Europe's key industries, employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility.
- Car manufacturers will have to pay more for innovation and research under the proposed CO2 regulation.
- The car of today is very much the same as that of 100 years ago, but it is extremely different regarding security, efficiency and its effect on the environment.
- Therefore, it is important to support new cars, because they are better, to support better road systems, better transport systems and better fuels The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledge-based economy only if it invests enough in research and especially if the results can be integrated into industrial production.
- The environment is one of the major challenges of the century.
- In major urban areas, traffic and pollution constitute a problem for 66% of European The rapporteur for the European Commission proposes far-reaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhausts, improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels.
- The rapporteur has misgivings about the level of ambition of the legislation.
- The rapporteur has presented a report on CO2 emissions.
- According to Personal089, Europe should focus more on research on engines that run at a higher temperature and on software for control purposes.
- Mr Chatzimarkakis' report urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets for the automotive industry.
- It follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations, such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions, the need to ensure appropriate lead-times and the protection of Tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage.
- The new standard for CO2 emissions per kilometre is 120 grams.
- Volkswagen TDI 1900 meets the new standard.
- The Seventh Framework Programme contains over EUR 4 billion of The European Union's car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year and creating 2.3 million jobs.
- It also accounts for a EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation.
- Despite all this optimistic data, the PERSON093 thinks that waiting until 2015 to substantially reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles is irresponsible.
- PERSON094 wants to make sure that all car manufacturers will have to comply with the new rules.
- Mr Turmes asked a question about the car industry.
- Mr Turmes was talking about the connection between industrial policy and environmental policy, between economy and ecology.
- Mrs Corbey said that Chinese cars are more environmentally friendly than those made in Europe and that they are now flooding the European market.
- The European car manufacturers and the European automotive suppliers have not been asleep in recent years and they have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable them to achieve their objectives.
- The only working hydrogen-powered cars in the world are to be found in Europe.
- PERSON097 thanks her fellow Members for the fair and open debate.
- She also thanks Claude Turmes for his clarifications and suggestions.
- She considers the remarks made by Mrs Liotard to be unfair.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by The People's Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has written a report on the rise of CO2 emissions from motor traffic.
- The rate of increase is alarming, for this sector increased 26% between 1990 and 2004.
- The car manufacturers' voluntary
