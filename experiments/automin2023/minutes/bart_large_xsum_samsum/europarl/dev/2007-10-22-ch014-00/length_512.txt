SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the report by Christa Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of The European Parliament has approved a framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
- It proposes a number of measures to reduce the risks and dependence on pesticides.
- According to the thematic strategy, special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network.
- There is a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on The European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive on plant protection products.
- The proposal supplements the internal market by setting up flexible mutual recognition of zones, and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions, in cases of special health or environmental The proposal will create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
- The procedure will be shorter and more efficient.
- Member States will no longer be working in isolation.
- The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer The President, Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos, welcome the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides.
- The Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably.
- They must strive for consistency with other Community provisions.
- The Commission proposes harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents.
- It is up to all of us now to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations.
- PERSON079 asks for the floor as she is not satisfied with the presentation of the Environment Committee's position on the report.
- The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides is a non-legislative political document that accompanies the directive.
- It proposes a 50% reduction in the most dangerous pesticides and a frequency index for other pesticides.
- The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides.
- They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country.
- Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along Parliament's Environment Committee is introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health, and environmental and consumer protection.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed that decisions on the authorisation of active substances and the assessment of the risks According to Directive 2006/215, food products that are not compliant with Directive 2005/06/215 must carry an indication to that effect.
- The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when.
- The Environment Committee came out against dividing Europe into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types.
- There are no intergovernmental agreements to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences within the defined zones.
- Last month the Commission reduced set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production.
- The Commission is dealing with this in a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH.
- There are some chemicals that are safe to use but should be taken off the market PERSON084 has two opinions on the use of pesticides.
- Pesticides are useful and necessary and without them it would be difficult to feed 6 billion people.
- The industry is focusing on the major crops, the 'big five', rice, corn, maize, soya beans and The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied the Commission's and the Committee's proposals on the report.
- It is clear that there is no need for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Commission or the Committee responsible.
- As draftswoman of her Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, she comments on the proposal.
- PERSON086 is against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would require farmers to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before applying plant protection products.
- PERSON087 is in favour of the Commission's proposal.
- The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and Irena Belohorská is grateful for the close cooperation that went into drafting the text.
- There is a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and reduce their levels of consumer protection.
- In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted.
- If the proposal is implemented, they will be forced to double the number.
- If the Commission's proposals are implemented, every country will approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
- The ALDE Group supports strict control of pesticides.
- They co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.
- According to the ALDE Group, it is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children's playgrounds and school areas from the use of pesticides.
- However, it's more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area The European Union is trying to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants.
- However, in past years the quality of pesticides was much worse, they were used in much higher doses and, as a result, the pollution in The European Parliament voted in favour of the 'pesticides package'.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, has prepared a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides in Europe.
- The most important result of the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on human health deriving from pesticide use, but it deals with this In the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand.
- I am sceptical about the policy based on reducing use.
- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and There is evidence that there is a link between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on one hand and various diseases on the other.
- The EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it has 4% of the world's arable land.
- EU support schemes The proposal to introduce a 10-metre limit on the use of pesticides in agriculture is overkill.
- People097 will vote against it.
- The task of the Commissioner is to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure data protection.
- The Commissioner is concerned about the health of farmers and their families and the long-term evaluations provided for in Directive 91/ The European Parliament voted in favour of subsidiarity on pesticides.
- According to the proposal, the Commission should encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region.
- According to President Breyer, strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents should not be applied indiscriminately.
- Instead of imposing blanket bans, the Commission should focus on efficient pest control and proper risk management.
- The European Parliament will vote on the amendments to the Plant Protection Regulation.
- Early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocer's to buy bottled drinking water.
- Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater.
- They have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations, but it must be repeated in order to prevent them from being The proposal for a regulation to replace Directive 91/414/CE is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union and unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.
- The proposal changes the number of active substances from This evening's debate is about Europe's farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that causes too much pollution and towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity.
- As more scandals and more health risks are uncovered, public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides.
- PERSON105 is in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment, the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health and that are compatible with farmers' interests.
- PERSON106 There are positive aspects of the three reports on pesticides.
- However, both the bans on aerial application and on quantitative use reduction are not clearly defined and open the door to many risks.
- The Slovak Republic applies less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare while other countries apply as much as The Parliament supports a thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and wants to put some of it into effect immediately.
- They also support non-spray zones around watercourses.
- They are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would like to The debate on the use of pesticides is important for European agriculture and for environmental protection.
- The Commission, Member States and the EU should provide periodic training, and advisory and educational programmes that are financed at least in part by the companies that manufacture pesticides.
- There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection PERSON110: Madam President, plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe.
- Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect crops.
- The 10-metre buffer zones will be disastrous for the Netherlands and others and should be left out According to the Klaß report, it is a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but the quantitative approach adopted here is too rigid.
- As far as buffer strips are concerned, there is nothing wrong with the Commission's chosen strategy of treating subsidiarity as the key element The proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe and abolish the system of zones and mandatory mutual licensing is a balanced position.
- The proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research is based on science and will prove workable for Member States.
- The Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products and the Buffer Zone Directive are challenging legislative projects.
- They aim to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities.
- There are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today.
- The first one concerns a reduction target.
- It is not possible to create a common European reduction target of 20%.
- The national reduction targets will be established on the basis of national action plans.
- The second misunderstanding The PPE-DE Group did not support Erna Hennicot-Schoepges' report.
- The proposal on zoning is too arbitrary.
- The proposal for a 10-metre buffer zone in the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht would make it impossible to farm in the area.
- The proposal would also affect 35% of agricultural area in the Netherlands.
- The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats Pesticides are everywhere: in food, in water, in the air, in our body tissue and breast milk and - most frighteningly - in the bodies of unborn children.
- The long-term consequences of pesticide residues include various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage The key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
- Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
- New members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development.
- The current level of The Commission supports the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides.
- It partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets for the restriction of the most hazardous pesticides.
- The Commission can in principle accept the minimum width for buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses.
- The European Commission cannot endorse Amendment 86 of the proposal on mandatory adherence to integrated pest management by professional pesticide users.
- The Commission can accept 121 of the 166 amendments.
- It can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part.
- The European Parliament voted on the proposed regulation on fruit and vegetable production and safety.
- MEPs supported the Commission's proposal.
- They also supported the amendment to the definition of vulnerable groups and the mutual recognition of zones.
- The new proposal will introduce stricter criteria, to be implemented on a zonal basis.
- During the decision-making procedure, experts from other Member States will take an active part in the licensing procedure and by doing so will be able to assess the circumstances for the entire zone.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 17, 26, 49, 52, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 76, 94, 95, 97, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 115 and 117.
- It cannot accept Amendments The Commission reserves its position on Amendment 166.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 34, 39, 46, 50, 53, 54, 59, 61, 62, 63, 66, 76, 77, 80, 87, PERSON126 supports the current legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides.
- PERSON999 supports the thrust of the report.
- The draft text on plant protection products is based on compromise.
- Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades.
- The current rules are among the strictest in Europe.
- The compromise draft text applies to 29 substances out of more than 600 The amendments to EU Directive 91/414/EEC and the Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are unworkable and stray from the principle of focused and proportionate legislation based on scientific approach.
