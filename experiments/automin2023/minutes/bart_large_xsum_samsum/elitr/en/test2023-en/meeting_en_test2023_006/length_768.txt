SUMMARY
- PERSON19 is starting to run the experiments that PERSON11 told him about.
- The experiments are to complete the GPU test and to know which version of PROJECT2 works and it trains on floating point.
- They are doing it in F P sixteen, in the half precision.
- They need PERSON17, PERSON11 and PERSON19 are going to have a separate call tomorrow afternoon at 2 PM to discuss the multi-source research.
- PERSON17 will send a link to the ORGANIZATION4 calendar.
- PERSON9 is leaving and will probably be late for the call.
- He will finish the language model checking of ASR outputs.
- Once this is done, it will be integrated on PERSON5 and PERSON8.
- PERSON17 wants to make sure that the profanity filtering is integrated and tested well.
- It was tested on logs, but now it's time to test it on the live pipelines.
- PERSON4 can download the files to his local machine and use PROJECT10, but he prefers to PERSON8 will have a call with PERSON9 later today.
- They will discuss profanity filtering and spasm detection and removal.
- They also need to talk about the PROJECT5 Czech ASR.
- PERSON9 has already started preparing for the upcoming Monday seminar.
- The speaker will be an Italian guy, famous one, the author of PROJECT6.
- He will talk about verb frames and domain adaptation.

- PERSON6, PERSON16 and PERSON17 are discussing the multi-lingual model.

- PERSON16 was working with PROJECT2 and she had several problems with path conflicts.
- She needs to replace the wrong paths with the correct ones.

- She has issues with storage on Mala Strana and she is running out of PERSON6 wants to know how much space there is available on Troja.

- ORGANIZATION2 takes 50 gigabytes.
- ORGANIZATION12 wants PERSON12 to be on the call tomorrow at two.
