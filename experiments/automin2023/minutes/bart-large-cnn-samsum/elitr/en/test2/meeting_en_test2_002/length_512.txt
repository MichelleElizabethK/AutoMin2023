- The profanity filter has been tested on locks and now it's time to test it on the life pipelines.
- PERSON3 has a call with PERSON6 later today.
- They discuss profanity filtering and especially the spasm detection and removal.

- One problem is the implicit language model.
- The other is the robustness to different accents.
- PERSON10 will be leaving the team.
- The pipeline had to be started by PERSON10 and PERSON8 yesterday, but they failed to do it properly.
- It's up to PERSON3 and PERSON18 to solve the problem and propose a solution to the problem.
- PERSON18 had a talk with PERSON8, because he got stuck in the pipe.

- It was the same pipeline as the previous one.
- The fingerprint was still the same, but the worker was not running.
- PERSON15, PERSON18 and PERSON3 want to have a call with PERSON8 to discuss how to make the configuration cleaner.
- PERSON16 wants to remove scripts with different performance and create one script with different parametres.
- PERSON18 wants to limit the number of languages and profanity filtering.
- PERSON16, PERSON15 and PERSON18 are discussing whether it's better to run the multi-lingual platform with fewer languages enabled or with more languages enabled.
- They discuss the performance of the rainbow worker of PERSON16, which is in the pipeline at the moment.
- PERSON18, PERSON15, PERSON16 and PERSON15 discuss the problem with the PERSON16 tensor to tensor worker.
- They recommend using PROJECT3 as a fall back solution and launching rainbow worker from PERSON14 on their cluster.

- PERSON3 will start looking into getting PROJECT3 up and running.
- The devel at ORGANIZATION5 would be a good place to discuss the technical issues with people on the devel.

- PERSON12, PERSON16, PERSON3, PERSON18 and PERSON15 need path configs for the PROJECT3 itself and for the or in the model config to learn PERSON14's model.
- They need to replace the absolute paths on their systems with their paths and then hopefully it will work.
- PERSON16 is working on the shortening and extending models.
- He is running out of storage quota on lev√° strana.
- He needs to come up with an estimate how much more space he needs.
- He will use PROJECT5 dash ORGANIZATION5 for the technical issues.
- PERSON15 explains to IT EDU how to limit data growth and how much space is available on Troja.
- The ORGANIZATION8s one hundred language models take a lot of space.
- There is a command to check the quota.
- On Troja there is space on all the disk.
