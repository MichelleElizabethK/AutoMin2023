ATTENDEES : PERSON10, PERSON11, PERSON14, PERSON15, PERSON2, PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON7, PERSON8


SUMMARY
- PERSON2, PERSON7 and PERSON3 are on ORGANIZATION12 call.
- They are trying to synchronize the group, and the date and time of the week.
- The kids have taken all the children's computers, so PERSON3 can't share the ORGANIZATION2 doc.
- The call is being recorded.
- The ORGANIZATION7 conference is less than a month away.
- The conference will serve as a test for the organization.
- The next year's conference will be the main demo event for the PROJECT5 project.
- It will be attended by MLT researchers.
- The monolingual data that they can use for the project is needed for the rainbow models.
- PERSON11 wants to create a parallel corpus of spoken data from ORGANIZATION6corpus.
- The free version of the free version has some limitations.
- PERSON11 will write to PERSON13 as soon as possible to get in touch with him about this matter.
- PERSON11 and PERSON3 need monolingual data for, domain adaptation.
- They need to create synthetic data based on that data.
- They also need parallel data as much as possible.
- The ORGANIZATION6corpus that was started by PERSON13 last year never got to finish.
- PERSON3 wants to test the evaluation using PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT3.
- PERSON12 couldn't attend the call because he had a problem with ORGANIZATION5, so he wrote his report there.
- The PROJECT5 is completely finished.
- PERSON8 created a new index for PROJECT2.
- He wants to run PROJECT2 on data for around one hour and make minor changes.
- PERSON3 wants to make PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT2 the standard evaluation tool for spoken language translation.
- He wants to publish it finally at a conference in January.
- He also wants to fix bugs and get numbers and repeated measurements so that the number stabilize.

- Now he is working on PROJECT5 to develop multi-source models.
- He will get access to the system and cluster soon to do some experiments on the ORGANIZATION3 cluster.
- PERSON3, PERSON10, PERSON7, PERSON15 and Umar are working on a data augmentation project for PROJECT4.
- They need to do itterative back translation on Czech German news to have some higher quality in German-Czech news corpus.
- They want to use ORGANIZATION1 as a model for offline processing.
- PERSON3, PERSON7, PERSON15, PERSON16, PERSON10, PERSON5 and PERSON16 will train as a comparin comparison in using the exact same training data.
- PERSON4 will try some transfer learning on of double encoder model on GPus.
- PERSON7 is working on ORGANIZATION11 Common voice project.
- He's trying to improve the robustness of the PROJECT4 by using more non-native speakers.
- He got the data from the ORGANIZATION14 challenge.
- He doesn't know if he can use the data.
- PERSON7 is using the ORGANIZATION11 Common voice data set to train PROJECT7 in English PROJECT4.
- The main objective is to train a robust PRO PROJECT4.
- Next week, PERSON7 will start to work on multi-lingual PRO project4.
- PERSON7 and PERSON15 need to use the same data for ORGANIZATION13 evaluations as for PROJECT4.
- They need to check if they can use the data from the ORGANISATION14 challenge.
- Common voice is the best option as most papers that work with accented speech are working with the Common voice data set.
