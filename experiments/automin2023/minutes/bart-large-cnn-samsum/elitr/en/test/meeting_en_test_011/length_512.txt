ATTENDEES : PERSON1, PERSON4, PERSON5, PERSON6, PERSON7, PERSON9


SUMMARY
- PERSON4, PERSON9, PERSON7, PERSON6 and PERSON5 are talking on Skype.
- They are discussing the document they have in a document.
- They discuss the manning of the document and the topics of the documents they have.
- It seems that PERSON8 came out of paper.
- PERSON7 will do some probing on transformer networks.
- He will use the ORGANIZATION1 and SL the word the read the context word and manning.
- He can't hear very well, so he will use PROJECT5, OTHER8 or these of GPT tool.
- PERSON5 and PERSON7 are trying to solve the problem of how to deal with PDT with the tactogrammatical treebanks.
- The paper has distinct where they take attention between subject and verb, subjects and verbs and subjects and verb in sentences.
- They check how much it makes a difference if there is some simply intervening and now PERSON5 is fraze.
- PERSON7 wants to have a skype call with the people in LOCATION1 and LOCATION3 to organize a collaboration.
- They want to come to LOCation1 for 2 weeks and collaborate on something together.
- They need to create an organized call here with the leader.
- PERSON1, PERSON7 and PERSON10 are looking at the attention matrice of the syntactic laytion.
- The lower layer zero lenght layer was quite good for the determiners or multifiers and for one subject.
- There are some variances in the other layers.
- PERSON1 is training about the dependency trees.
- She is looking for the relations between syntactic corelation and syntactic tree.
- The higher layer for components depend subjects is called balustrade layer.
- The shorter phrases can be found in different balustrades.
- PERSON7 is doing experiments on ORGANIZATION3 translation.
- He finds it difficult to generate something similar to balustrades.
- PERSON1 suggests looking at all heads to find the one with the highest correlations.
- PERSON9 is looking for PERSON4, but he got away.
- PERSON1 is in LOCATION2 until the 15th December.
- He wants to compare the graph structures with syntactic trees to improve machine translation systems.
- He will be taken in the beginning of December and will switch to another network like PROJECT5.
- He is going to take the gold trees.
- PERSON5, PERSON7 and PERSON5 are going to meet in 14 days to discuss their master thesis topic.
- PERSON5 will send them the links to the tactogrammatic and the paper about the training of syntactic attention in two different heads.
- PERSON6 will add PERSON5 to their doctor Who group.
- PERSON9 and PERSON5 are working on PROJECT5 secure.
- They will get an invitation e-mail to join.
- They are going to experiment on the project and get the semantic score for the main paper.
- They need to analyse the data to have their own call.
- PERSON9, PERSON5, PERSON6 and PERSON1 are trying to solve a connection problem between PROJECT5 and PROJECT4.
- They are analysing a model that is trained in neuromantee, trained by PERSON4.
- It's based on multiligual PRO project 5 and PRO PROJECT4.
- PERSON5 and PERSON9 are trying to create a machine translation training model.
- The training model is different from the training of the actual machine translation.
- The yellow paper was like the some reason the small PROJECT5 model mention predict somenthing.
- The large one didn't.
- PERSON5 and PERSON9 are trying to organise an event for their master thesis.
- They need to set up a meeting with a model one-on-one in order to get the best picture form for the document.
- The deadline for the master thesis is coming up.
- PERSON9 has to send the paper to PERSON2 and PERSON2 adds in.
- The dean has to approve it.
- PERSON5 should have some experiments.
- PERSON6 and PERSON4 will write the paper together with PERSON9.
- They will send it to the dean.
