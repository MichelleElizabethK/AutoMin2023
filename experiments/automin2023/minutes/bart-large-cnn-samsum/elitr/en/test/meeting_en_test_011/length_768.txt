ATTENDEES : PERSON1, PERSON4, PERSON5, PERSON6, PERSON7, PERSON9


SUMMARY
- PERSON4, PERSON9, PERSON6, PERSON5 and PERSON7 are trying to talk to each other on Skype, but only one of them can hear them.
- They agree that PERSON7 will do some probing on transformer networks, and PERSON5 will probe on PROJECT5, PROJECT8 or PROJECT9.
- PERSON5 and PENPERSON7 are going to do a paper on attention and compution scores.
- They need to focus on the other 10s.
- They also need to do the tactogrammatical treebanks annotated on OTHER9 and OTHER7.
- PERSON7 wants to come to LOCATION1 for 2 weeks and collaborate on something with the people in LOCATION3.
- He will organize a Skype call with the leader of the group and then let the rest of the people know if they can come.
- PERSON1 has created a transformer attention matrices.
- PERSON1 is training about the dependency trees.
- The higher layer for components depend subjects was called balustrade layer.
- It's constructure which some heads correlates with relation in different laytions in syntactic tree.
- The shorter phrases can be in different balustrades in different heads.
- The different heads do different things in different ways.
- PERSON1 is in LOCATION2 until the 15th December.
- PERSON7 will be taken in the beginning of December.
- They want to switch to another network like PROJECT5.
- PERSON1 wants to extract the graph structures from the syntactic trees and compare it with the extract from the attentions.
- PERSON5, PERSON9 and PERSON7 will meet in 14 days to work on their master thesis.
- They will write a paper on the project they are working on.
- They need to write the final review e-mail and get the semantic score.
- PERSON9, PERSON5 and PERSON6 are working on a project.
- They are analysing a model of a Transformer, which is trained in neuromantee, trained by PERSON4.
- The model is based on multiligual PROJECT5 and PROJECT4.
- Transformer trained for machine translation would be more syntactic and PRO PROJECT5 less.
- PERSON5 is preparing her master thesis.
- She will submit it lenght tomorrow.
- She needs to create a training model for it.
- PERSON9 suggests to set up a one-on-one meeting with PERSON2 to talk about it more often.
- She should also prepare a video.
- PERSON9 has to send the paper to PERSON2 and PERSON2 adds in.
- The dean has to approve it.
- PERSON5 should have some experiments.
- PERSON6 and PERSON4 will write the paper together with PERSON9.
- They will send it to the dean.
