- The next planned session with PERSON5 will be watching some video that they are curious about.
- PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON3 are going to have a talk in OTHER6.
- They will try to rely on live generated translations into OTHER3 and they will also diagnose the flicker.
- The presentation machine takes screenshots regularly.
- If the screenshots change, it sends an updated picture to the browser.
- PERSON6 is studying computer science in LOCATION2 and PERSON10 is studying at ORGANIZATION3.
- PERSON7 is visiting master students for semester here and is going to leave back for LOCATION 2 or LOCATION 3.
- PERSON3 suggests a solution for static slides.
- PERSON7 agreed to join the surge.
- On Monday at 2, PERSON3 is giving a talk on the Monday seminar.
- He wants to know if PERSON9 was successful with his exams and if he can help with domain adaptation.
- He also needs to work on computational linguistics language model for the talk.
- PERSON9 wants to know how to replace a word with a replacement one from the LOCATION3 language model.
- The replacement word should be some random feminine noun with a similar declaration pattern and the corresponding form.
- PERSON3 is not sure if it's necessary to process the dictionary.
- There will be a technical talk in OTHER3 on Monday.
- PERSON3, PERSON9 and PERSON6 will have files ready for the Monday talk.
- PERSON5 will get in touch with PERSON5 to pass on the files to him so he can use them for the talk.
- PERSON3 needs to synchronize with PERSON9 to get the language model data related to her talk on Monday.
- She needs it from PERSON6, PERSON10 and then PERSON11 to get it to the first people who are online, so that they can use it.
- PERSON10 worked on three different things this week.
- He implemented a real time audio visualization tool on the old realization tool.

- The last problem is how to stand thresholds.
- PERSON5 will email the scripts to test the thresholds.
- PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON5 are working on their project.
- They need to improve the visualisation and train the paraphrasing model.
- They are going to get training today and hope to have some results by the end of the weekend.
- PERSON10 had to do a project in PROJECT5, but it wasn't trained on TPU support, so he will have to export it as.
- open neural network exchange format.
- The format is called PROJECT4, but the critical thing is to know the architecture of the network and in the architecture.
- PERSON3 and PERSON10 are trying to figure out if they are running LOCATION3 OTHER3 from PROJECT1 or TensorFlow.
- They are mostly using PROJECT5 models, which are trained in a similar way, but they don't have the connection to the integration of OTHER1 models.
- They want to collect data from their models within 2 weeks.
- PERSON10 worked on data collection this week in five languages.
- He will make a model where he would throw away the lower source languages and use the main ones.
- He needs to translate the monolingual data to create synthetic parallel data.
- PERSON11 will translate all the languages into OTHER3 and OTHER3.
- PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON11 are going to do offline translations of large data.
- The languages can be used.
- The parallel data extraction will be done by ORGANIZATION2.
- PERSON6 is going back to work next week.
- If he has more time, he will work on PROJECT5.
- PERSON5 spent most of the week preparing for the dry run and organizing the ORGANIZATION1 event yesterday.
- He also worked on implementing the segmenter worker on and freezing some issues.
- PERSON12 helped him integrate buffer in the LOCATION3 segmenter.
- PERSON5 is looking for LOCATION3 data set with the correct transcripts.
- He will send an email to PERSON6 to get the data set.
- PERSON10 proposes to make a Wikipedia page with all the data sets that they are using and they plan to use.
- PERSON2 is on vacation this week, so PERSON3 is organizing the data exchange.
