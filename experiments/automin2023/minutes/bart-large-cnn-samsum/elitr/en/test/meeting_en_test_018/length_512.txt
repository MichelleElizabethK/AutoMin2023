ATTENDEES : PERSON10, PERSON12, PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON6, PERSON7


SUMMARY
- PERSON7 and PERSON6 will meet with PERSON12 on Monday at 12 o'clock on the presentation platform to discuss the functionalities to be checked.
- The first prototype should be ready on the 7th of June, like the first very first shot with box.
- PERSON12 and PERSON7 will meet on Monday the 20th of May at 10.
- They will discuss the presentation platform and the integration with PROJECT4.
- PERSON4 will start coding next week and he hopes to have a prototype within a couple of weeks.
- PERSON7 is trying to translate incomplete sentences for the user experience.
- The cashing client makes the latency too big for the final users.
- The ASR does not close sentences at all.
- Sequence labeling task labels the sentences and eventually will place a label to end the sentence.
- PERSON7 and PERSON6 are discussing the input for PROJECT4 client.
- They need to create the segmenters for all the ASR languages.
- They should train their empty systems to work on all the individual lines that they are getting from the segmentation workers.
- PERSON4, PERSON6, PERSON7 and PERSON4 are going to play with the MT system and change the training data for the MT systems to handle this type of input.
- The system will be judged by the final translation, which is the output of the mock conference with the interpreters.
- PERSON7 is translating partial sentences and even more sentences in one go.
- The first segmentation is fine, but later on the system goes crazy.
- The problem is probably the timestamps.
- The segmentation worker is not emitting them.
- It receives them, but doesn't emit them.
- ORGANIZATION6 needs to improve the segmentation worker so that it emits the timestamps.
- The statistics of on the internet will translate only the later part of a sentence.
- The baseline for the workshop would be to have models that translates this data.
- PERSON7 suggests changing the cashing worker to keep the segmentation coming from segmentation worker and translate sentences like this instead of waiting for full sentences.
- PERSON3 doesn't want to because of the risk of false information from the empty worker.
- PERSON4 agrees and recommends sharing the code for the emptyworker.
- PERSON7, PERSON4, PERSON6 and PERSON3 need to train the models to accept partial sentences and even sentences that started at the middle of the sentence.
- The segmentation worker trained for Czech is still missing.
- The integration of PROJECT4 is still a problem.
- PERSON6 and PERSON7 are working on the production connector for the cruise control.
- They are testing it in the dry runs.
- If it works well, they will send the plain text files and add work granularity.
- They will also prepare one language model for the workshop.
- PERSON6 will have to ask back ASR people if they need to adapt the models system any more.
- There are a lot of effort language models and it's possible that models system don't need adaptation any more, according to PERSON7.
- PERSON7 will let PERSON3 know next week what will be supported at PROJECT3.
- The workshop runs in English.
- There will be one interpretation of from English into Czech and one interpretation from Czech into German.
- The integration and segmentation worker for Czech is working hard to get the pipeline.
- PERSON6 and PERSON7 will continue the deployment of the connector to the main client.
- The daily test is not necessary as they have the install and test scripts and they run them every now and then.
- The student who is supposed to train PROJECT4 is not delivering anything.
- They will try to get some data from PERSON8.
- PERSON7, PERSON4 and PERSON10 are going to fine tune the MT domain dependent data for MT fine tuning by.
- Wednesday, June 19th.
- They are collecting the data from the German to English ASR and using the ORGANIZATION2 platform to do the pipoting.
- PERSON7, PERSON12 and PERSON12 need to test if the platform supports pivoting.
- If it does, they will replace the PROJECT4 worker that PERSON4 will be developing.
- PERSON3 confirms that the new ORGANIZATION2 presentation platform works.
- PERSON6 has created a paralel subsentence corpus of two million words.
- He wants to train on the output from ASR with errors against the references.
- PERSON3 would be skeptical about ASR from text to speech.
- PERSON10 thinks the empty system can prepared for the such errors.
- PERSON6, PERSON7 and PERSON4 are planning a workshop at the end of June.
- They need to train on ORGANIZATION6 ASR from docks.
- They are planning to rely on PROJECT4.
- PERSON7 is planning to come to LOCATION1 in person.
- PERSON7 wants to know if someone from the project is planning to come in person to see it live.
- The last person who came was from PROJECT5.
- ORGANIZATION6 is running age ASR workers for English, and four of them don't emit any output.
- If they run the same client, the same pipeline six times, they will end up with ineffective pipelines.
- PERSON12 has a question regarding the ORGANIZONATION2 platform.
- He wants to know if the mediator who subscribes the service is able to provide the service.
- PERSON7 suggests that the platform could have tests of workers.
- If the test fails, the platform would kill the worker.
- Another option would be to force the platform to use particular worker for pipeline or session.
- This is to be discussed on Monday.
- PERSON7 and PERSON12 want to share with them their experiment this afternoon in order to be more prepared on Monday.
- PERSON3 would like to press some of the ASR clients or the are not working, and then they can do something about it.
- The person the worker is not free dubt as mark is busy.
- PERSON6 reminds that next time they would like to make of such failure to debug.
- The general PROJECT2 call will be held in 5 minutes.
- There are too many things to discuss to have it faster, so PERSON12 and PERSON7 have to end the call.
