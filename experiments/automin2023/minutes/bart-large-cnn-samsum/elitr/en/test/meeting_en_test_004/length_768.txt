ATTENDEES : PERSON10, PERSON13, PERSON14, PERSON3, PERSON7


SUMMARY
- PERSON10, PERSON7, PERSON14, PERSON15, PERSON6, PERSON8 and PERSON4 are going to have a presentation workshop next week.
- The presentation platform is slowly taking its form.
- There is no way to switch off the webcam in the ORGANIZATION2.
- PERSON10, PERSON3, PERSON5, PERSON13, PERSON14 and PERSON7 are working on a text client for the presentation.
- It works with PROJECT1 server, ORGANIZATION7 worker and in between a Python server which handles translation.
- There is still a bug with the KT translation platform.
- PERSON3, PERSON14, PERSON5, and PERSON7 are working together to find a solution to the problem of batch processing.
- The main priority is to have the online mode working.
- PERSON5 needs to test machine translation by looking at the output of the online ASR.
- PERSON10, PERSON14, PERSON13 and PERSON6 discuss how to test the integration of the PROJECT1 worker connection between the ASR and the text-only client for the mission translation.
- They decide to use the offline ASR mode of operation.
- PERSON14 will run a command on his command line to produce text that resembles the output of the ASr.
- PERSON10, PERSON5, PERSON7, PERSON13 and PERSON14 are concerned about the quality of the online ASR and machine translation system.
- They are trying to find a solution to the problem of the mismatch of the segmentations between the training mode and the operation mode.
- PERSON13, PERSON14, PERSON10, PERSON13 and PERSON7 are working on a demo.
- They are trying to improve the quality of the segmentation.
- They need to send the TED files with their translations to ORGANIZATION5, who will send them to PERSON5.
- PERSON5 will test the PROJECT1 worker.
- PERSON7 needs to raise the microphone level a bit.
- There is no ASR worker available.
- The debug bug kills all the workers.
- PERSON7 created a text to text client, but it didn't work with the segmentation workers in ORGANIZATION5.
- The segmentation worker shares a lot of the code with MT worker and will probably have the same problem as the text client for the MT worker.
- The CTM is the word level output of ASR.
- There is no immediate plan to have a client that can digest CTM and send it to segmentation.
- PERSON10, PERSON5, PERSON13, PERSON15, and PERSON6 are trying to fix a bug in Organisation5's ASR workers.
- The ASR worker is not working properly.
- PERSON5 will be back next week and they will arrange a hands-on debugging session.
- PERSON10, PERSON15, PERSON14 and PERSON3 are confused about the delay in voice recognition.
- They need to reverse engineer the system to find out why there is a delay in the translation of unsegmented text.
- The presentation platform only handles the text as it comes out of the segmentor.
- PERSON10, PERSON7, PERSON13, PERSON14 and PERSON15 will meet next week to discuss the problems with ORGANIZATION5 segmentation and MT.
- They will do PROJECT1 test next week, PERSON5 will do PROJECT1 next week.
- Everybody will be speaking non-native English.
- There will be four cabins with interpreters, students of interpretation, and will have one floor signal, one re-speaker into Czech and one into German.
- The presentation platform will receive all the streams and choose the main the selected stream for each languages.
- If the main stream dies for some reason, the presentation platform would keep checking for the various sources.
- PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON15 discuss the functional requirements for the presentation platform.
- They discuss the monitoring of the re-speakers cabins and the machine translation of the audio streams.
- They also discuss the possibility of all audio streams being translated into all target languages at all times.
- PERSON10 and PERSON3 discuss the setup of the presentation platform for the June conference.
- There will be a man monitoring the platform, a man watching logs from the ASR workers and logs from MT systems, and a man doing the choice in the platform blind.
- PERSON10 and PERSON3 are planning a project for next year.
- There are 4000 people connected on the same WiFi network.
- The current user are expected to be at June.
- The integration has asked PERSON3 to report PERSON10.
- They need to organize the people by the language and put screens in front of the group that wants to read Polish subtitles.
- They have a year to find a better solution.
- PERSON10, PERSON7, PERSON3, PERSON5 and PERSON13 will talk to each other again next Friday to resolve some bugs and ship their PROJECT1 models to PERSON5.
- They should also test the PERSON5 workers with their PRO PROJECT1 model.
