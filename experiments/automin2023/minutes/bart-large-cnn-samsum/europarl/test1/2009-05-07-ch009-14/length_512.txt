SUMMARY
- Amendment 45a, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, is inadmissible because it compares Pope Benedict's 2009 statement with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty and torture everywhere, and condemning the imprisonment of a Sudanese leader who has been released.
- The legal service and the President of the European Parliament's opinion that the amendment is admissible.
- Amendment 2 is about promoting sexual and reproductive health rights as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS.
- The rest of the amendment remains unchanged.
- After the vote on Amendment 16, PERSON129 mistakenly announced that Amendment 16 was rejected, when in fact it was adopted.
