SUMMARY
- The Committee on Budgets is concerned with the 2009 Preliminary draft budget for the European Union for the year 2009.
- Jutta Haug, on behalf of the Committee, criticises the Commission's draft budget.
- She hopes that the plenary session will also take a unanimous decision on it.
- Parliament has supported the fight against climate change and the promotion of competitiveness for growth and employment.
- The Commission earmarked almost EUR 14 billion in the budget for the environment, but EUR 13 billion is already allocated to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
- Parliament wants to implement the European priorities, and a proper budget is required in order to do this.
- The 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget was prepared by the Commission within the limits of the financial programming period 2007-2013.
- The highest financial growth is to be expected from the programmes that encourage economic development and competitiveness and those promoting freedom, security and justice, financed from the corresponding budget categories.
- The Commission will table an amendment to the draft for Palestine and Kosovo before the preliminary discussions of the 2009 draft budget get under way in Parliament.
- The Commission will also table proposals regarding the supplementary financing of short-term measures in developing countries that are struggling to cope with the impact of the rise in food prices.
- For the first time, the Commission has a list of new pilot projects and preparatory actions.
- PERSON078 is dissatisfied with heading 4 of the draft budget.
- Heading 4 is only 1.8% up on the 2008 budget, which is below the average budget increase of 3.1%.
- The portion reserved for external relations and development was cut in the preliminary draft budget this year.
- Head 4 does not have enough funds for the Mediterranean and food aid.
- PERSON079 is rapporteur for the budget for development cooperation.
- He is concerned about the food crisis and results-oriented evaluation of development aid.
- He thinks that too little attention is being paid to food security and food production in developing countries.
- He supports the proposal by the European Commission to use underspends from agriculture for this purpose.
- There is a discrepancy between the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy and what is proposed in the budget.
- Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is concerned at the inadequate margin, 82 million under heading 1A.
- Council is endeavouring to increase the margin, among other things by a number of administrative cuts.
- The energy and climate policy calls for a substantial amount of new funding.
- The Commission proposes 30 million for Joint Undertakings to develop fuel cells and hydrogen gas technology.
- The Preliminary Draft Budget also needs more money for passenger rights and for research and for new transport strategies.
- PERSON082 thanks Mrs Haug for a good report summarising what the Parliament thinks about the Preliminary Draft Budget.
- People's Party wants value to be generated from budgetary expenditure, so it is prepared to act in the interests of greater efficiency.
- France understands Europe and has done a lot for it, but it has gone away to build it.
- There is a surplus in the agriculture budget due to the impact of global markets.
- The Union has serious debts in this area.
- The twelve new Member States will have to wait ten years before they receive the same support as the old ones.
- There is a moral obligation to redress this competitive disadvantage.

- In 2008, the Commission left an unused margin of more than EUR 3 billion.
- The Commission proposes a margin of more than EUR 2 billion for the 2009 budget.
- The Council proposes to increase it to EUR 2.4 billion.
- The Commission and Council need to go over the monitoring and writing of each budget line again and explore all the possibilities for achieving a realistic, unifying budget for 2009.

- EU's budget is basically 1% of Europe's GDP, which is derisory in comparison with the 20% of GDP committed by the United States at federal level.

- Without the Reform Treaty, some key points of future-oriented common policy are not yet in place.
- The European Council has presented an intensive programme for revising the multiannual financial programming.
- According to PERSON090, sneaking a project like that in under heading 2 by creating a new legal basis is simply not on.
- It is a revision of the financial perspective and belongs under heading 4.
- The old trick of financing the common foreign and security policy and new priorities at the expense of developing countries is no longer acceptable.
