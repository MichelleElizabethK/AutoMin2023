SUMMARY
- The final version of the draft order of business as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents has been distributed.
- Mrs Bauer's report on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities has been rejected.
- Mr BÃ¶ge's reports on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund: Italy, Abruzzo earthquake, Germany - telecommunications sector, and Mrs Haug's report - Draft amending budget 9/2009: earthquake in Italy have been removed from the order.
- The Committee on Budgets adopted the four reports at the beginning of the week, but they haven't been translated yet.
- The vote on mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the Abruzzo region has been postponed by two weeks and will take place during the part-session in Strasbourg.
- It was difficult to do the translations in such a short time and the rule which we apply is deferral of the matter.
- The discussion is closed.
- PERSON025 will ask the services to deliver some crucial translations by tomorrow and then we can vote tomorrow as well.
- The debate scheduled for tomorrow only targets one country and does not cover the question of freedom of the press in Europe.
- The PPE refuses to allow this Parliament to become a place in which purely national political accounts are settled.
- PERSON028 and PERSON029 support Mr Daul's proposal to debate freedom of expression and press freedom in the broadest sense.
- They argue that some people in Europe do not respect the freedom of the press to the same extent as Daul.
- The Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy will remain on the order of business.
- PERSON032, Mr Daul and Mr Schulz want the debate on the freedom of information in Italy to focus on Europe and not on Italy.
- PERSON033, Mr President, wants there to be a resolution on the issue of the funding of Abruzzo.
