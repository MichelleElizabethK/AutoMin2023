- The European Parliament is more than willing to play its part in this exercise.
- The Eurozone has to be a player with a strong voice on the international stage.
- In its first ten years, the euro has been an unqualified success.
- The institutions have proven their worth.
- The Stability and Growth Pact is now facing its first big test in the form of the handling of the financial crisis.
- The differences in the development of competitiveness between the Euro Zone and the rest of Europe are due to the fact that the Eurozone has local budgetary and financial policies.
- The Stability and Growth Pact cannot be just set to one side.
- The package for the financial markets was wrapped up quickly and the governments took action.
- Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup, Juncker, were not invited to the most recent summit in Washington.
- The European Parliament is prepared to cooperate closely and will be able to set the tone with this report.
- The report on the tenth anniversary of the Economic and Monetary Union congratulates the rapporteurs, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen, and all those who worked on it.
- The report also praises the cooperation between the various political groups.
- The first ten years of the euro have been very positive.
- In terms of the usefulness of the Euro in tackling the current situation, the conclusion is also positive.
- The European Commission will present an action plan on 26 November.
- The report on Economic and Monetary Union talks about the need to expand the way in which fiscal and budgetary policies are coordinated.
- The euro area ended 2007 almost breaking even for the first time in its history, with a deficit of 0.6-0.7%.
- PERSON060 agrees with the plan to adapt national programmes in order to unite national policies and make them convergent and consistent with a European strategy, policies and instruments.
- He also agrees with many of the governance aspects of the report.
- He hopes the Finance Ministers in the Ecofin Council and in the Eurogroup will agree.
- PERSON061 congratulates rapporteurs on the report on the assessment of the first ten years of the single currency.
- The report has the support of a large majority within the House.
- The House's enthusiasm for the single euro is far more pronounced today than it was 10 years ago.
- The Eurozone crisis is one of the most serious crises Europe has had to tackle over the past few decades.
- Europe has avoided repeating the mistakes made in Europe during the 1970s.
- A strong and coordinated economic policy response at European level is necessary.
- The creation of the world's second major currency brings advantages, but it also entails obligations.
- The G20 of last Friday and Saturday in Washington reminded us of the obligations of ourselves and others.
- The G20 has set an ambitious road map.
- It must be translated into concrete action by the G20 and by the European Union and the members of the Eurogroup.
- US and UK governments had all the time they needed to accept Eurogroup's proposals on better regulation of the financial markets but they didn't.
- PERSON061 is not seeking the Presidency of the Eurogroup out of a sense of duty.
- He believes the European Central Bank and the Commission should be represented on a long-term basis at the G20 and at the International Monetary Fund.
- In Luxembourg, the heads of state or government need to give their ministers of finance the necessary instructions.
- Ten years on from its creation, the EMU should be regarded as a European success story of which we should be proud.
- Increased use of the euro as an international currency benefits the Member States of the Euro Zone.
- Euro exchange rates have been too high for too long and have had negative effects, constraining exports.
- PERSON063 proposes to study the feasibility of a body for regulating monetary differences on the model of what the States managed to create in the trade sphere at the World Trade Organisation.
- He supports the Commission's proposal to develop common, European monetary positions and a single seat for the Euro Zone within the international financial institutions and forums.

- PERSON066 congratulates the rapporteurs and the Commission on their initiative in preparing a text reviewing the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union.

- The most powerful European countries have already taken steps to stimulate their national economies.
- Europe is more than the more or less coordinated sum of national policies.
- The time has come to make the euro one of Europe's central tools to ensure a robust currency and a robust real economy.
- The euro must be accompanied by mechanisms guaranteeing the central objective of achieving social and regional convergence.
- The European Central Bank and the euro have so far passed the litmus test of this financial crisis with flying colours.
- The call for European economic government fails to recognise that much has already been done to coordinate the policies of the individual Member States and to harmonise them.

- The European Economic and Monetary Union is a stable area with clear accession criteria.

- The EU is lagging behind when it comes to combating tax havens and extending the Directive on savings income.
- Member States are embarking on 'revival' plans.
- The coordination effort is not going very well.
- The responses to the revisited Stability and Growth Pact are neither sufficient nor a match for the challenge awaiting us.

- The truth about the euro is quite different.
- Its first ten years have entailed enormous costs in the form of reduced growth and increased unemployment.

- Commissioner Almunia congratulates rapporteurs on their excellent work and thanks them for incorporating two of his proposals into the review of ten years of the euro area.
- He proposes introducing financial analysis into the definition of the monetary policy and taking into account divergences between the Member States.
- The current financial crisis has changed his attitude to the Eurogroup's role and influence on the European Union.
- The economic downturn can be halted by implementing an economic policy, which is better coordinated among Member States.
- Those countries that have remained outside the Euro Zone's borders have suffered more.
- The European Parliament adopted a resolution on economic policy.

- Mr Mölzer missed the point.
- The euro and enlargement are the European Union's most visible successes of the last 10 years.

- The financial crisis has demonstrated that the euro has helped us to avoid currency speculation and prevent it in the Euro Zone.
- The last few months have demonstrated the strength of the euro.
- The euro should be the currency of the whole of Europe.
- It is wrong to make membership in the euro into an exclusive club with higher entry requirements.
- Sweden's position outside the Euro Zone should not be increased.
- In 1992, Sweden allowed the krona to fall against the euro.

- The European Central Bank's inflation target is 2%.
- Eurostat has announced that a major recession is starting in the Eurozone countries.
