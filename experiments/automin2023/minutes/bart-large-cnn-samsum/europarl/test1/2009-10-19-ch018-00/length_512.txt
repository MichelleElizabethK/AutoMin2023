SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver.
- The report by Mr Busuttil on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is also discussed.
- There is a visa waiver between the European Union and citizens of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda.
- It applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa.
- It is valid for a maximum stay of 3 months within a 6-month period.
- The European Community can suspend or terminate an agreement on behalf of all its Member States.
- Before the vote on the reports at committee level, they were given a guarantee on the part of the European Commission that full reciprocity would be ensured.
- This was an essential principle for us.
- This agreement has been achieved in the requisite manner.
- The six non-EU countries were transferred from the negative list to the positive list of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.
- They are Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles.
- The visa waiver covers all categories of persons travelling for all kinds of purposes except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.
- The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is in favour of European Union agreements with six countries.
- With these agreements, citizens of these six countries and EU citizens will be exempted from the short-stay visa requirement.
- excluded from this exemption are those who wish to work or to perform a paid activity, as an employee or as a service provider.
- PERSON113 and PERSON114 support Simon Busuttil's report, which endorses the European Commission's initiative.
- They are surprised that the agreements do not apply to the outermost regions of France when they do apply to outermost areas of Portugal.
- They believe that the English term 'valid passport' was translated into French as 'passeport ordinaire' and would be the correct translation.
- PERSON115 thanks Mrs Vergiat, Mr Busuttil, Mr Coelho and the Vice President of the European Commission Jacques Barrot for their intervention.
- The principle of reciprocity is important to the European Union.
- Brazil and the United States are not honouring the principle.
