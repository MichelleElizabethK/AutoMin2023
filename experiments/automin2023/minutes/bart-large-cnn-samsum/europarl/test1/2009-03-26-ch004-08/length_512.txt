SUMMARY
- PERSON077 asks for the final vote on the resolution and the report to be postponed until the next plenary sitting.
- The majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so, but they need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that the human rights situation in Turkmenistan will be monitored.
- PERSON085 wants to postpone the final votes and vote on the amendments to the report on Turkmenistan, not to your report.
- PERSON087 wants to replace 'prospect of signing the Agreement' with 'the prospect of finalising the process of ratifying the Agreement'.
