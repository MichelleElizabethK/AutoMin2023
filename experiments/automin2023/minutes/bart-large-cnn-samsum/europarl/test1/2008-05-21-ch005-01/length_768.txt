SUMMARY
- The European Parliament will vote on an amendment to the calendar of part-sessions for 2009 regarding the week 16, from 13 to 19 April, which is the week directly before the Orthodox Easter.
- The amendment is not admissible because there is no proposal for the European Parliament to meet in this particular week.
- The constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009, so some members might not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights.
- There are seven Jewish and 13 Protestant festive days which cannot be observed because they are working days.
- The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July, which is one of the most important secular holidays in France.
- PERSON123 wants to make a similar proposal.
- The vote will proceed to the vote.
