SUMMARY
- There have been 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000.
- Last year Excel Airways went bankrupt in the UK, leaving over 200,000 people out of pocket and stranded at airports.
- Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, submitted a question to the Commission on passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy.
- There is a loophole in the package travel directive that needs to be closed.
- If you book a charter with a holiday company, you are covered by the directive, but if you book your seat only - the airline flight - you are not.
- Parliament and the Commission want to work with the Commission to find a solution to this problem.
- PERSON250 is grateful to Mr Simpson and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for bringing the issue to the attention of Parliament.
- The protection of passengers in all transport sectors is a priority for him.
- The Commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues.
- A study has been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector.
- The Commission is continuing to analyse the various possible options on the basis of this study.

- Parliament's contribution will be crucial.
- In the current global economic crisis, airline operators, particularly low-cost airlines, are going through very difficult times.
- The financial losses sustained by airlines in 2009 will amount to approximately USD 11 billion.
- In the event of bankruptcy due to lack of adequate legislation, there is no practical means of recovering the equivalent value of the tickets or getting passengers left stranded abroad flown home.
- Tighter controls on the airline carriers' financial situation, tighter control on mergers and takeovers, and setting up a sizeable guarantee fund could offer passengers protection in the long term.
- There have been 77 bankruptcies in the aviation sector since 2000.

- A number of airlines have recently gone bankrupt in Europe.
- There are hundreds of passengers stranded in destinations from which it is difficult to get back home.
- The Commission and EU Member States are capable of finding a rapid solution to passengers' problems.

- Government should return money to the airline's passengers for tickets they have purchased.
- There was a problem at Bratislava airport when SkyEurope went bankrupt.
- Ronald Schranz expressed regret at the inconvenience for the passengers.
- The proposal of the Commissioner is to introduce the idea of 'sky solidarity', which would incorporate the principle of joint responsibility of airlines for passengers.

- Commissioner is confident that a solution will be put forward that will boost customer confidence in the air transport sector, which has been badly affected by the global economic crisis.
- There have been several large bankruptcies of airline companies this year.
- The EU has seen a major expansion of low-cost carriers in air transport and fiercer competition between all EU airlines thanks to liberalisation measures.
- The idea of introducing compulsory insurance against bankruptcy for airlines has been proposed in the European Parliament in the recent past.
- There is a legal vacuum which leaves passengers with no guarantee should an airline go bankrupt.
- European legislation protects passengers who have purchased their ticket as part of a package holiday, but not those who buy their ticket on the Internet.
- Young people and people on the lowest incomes are particularly affected by this phenomenon.
- The air transport sector has experienced an unprecedented crisis leading to a significant reduction in air travel.
- There are other cases where airlines may stop operating or suspend their activities, such as when their licence is suspended for safety reasons, voluntary closure or closure for any reason other than financial collapse.
- Passenger compensation for delay or cancellation could be one of the instruments to be used, but it is not enough.
- Commission should consider legislative measures for other cases.
- The European Union has a Community consumer protection policy.
- Most of the complaints received from European consumers relate to the violation of airline passengers' rights.
