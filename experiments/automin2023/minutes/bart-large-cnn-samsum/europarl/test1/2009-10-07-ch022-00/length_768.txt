SUMMARY
- There have been 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000.
- Brian Simpson, on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, has submitted a question to the Commission on passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy.
- There is a loophole which needs to be closed in the law on passenger rights in aviation.
- PERSON250 is grateful to Mr Simpson and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for bringing the issue to the attention of Parliament.
- The protection of passengers in all transport sectors is a priority for him.
- The Commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues.
- A study has been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector.
- The Commission is continuing to analyse the various possible options on the basis of this study.

- Parliament's contribution will be crucial.
- In the current global economic crisis, airline operators, particularly low-cost airlines, are going through very difficult times.
- The financial losses sustained by airlines in 2009 will amount to approximately USD 11 billion.
- In the event of bankruptcy due to lack of adequate legislation, there is no practical means of recovering the equivalent value of the tickets or getting passengers left stranded abroad flown home.
- Tighter controls on the airline carriers' financial situation, tighter control on mergers and takeovers, and setting up a sizeable guarantee fund could offer passengers protection in the long term.
- There have been 77 bankruptcies in the aviation sector since 2000.
- Thousands of people have lost money on their tickets.
- The Commission will present a proposal over the next year.
- There is a disparity between those booking a flight via a tour operator and those booking their ticket online.
- The current legislation is not applied fully.
- There is a gap in consumer protection where air passengers are concerned.
- The Commissioner is working on a solution.
- The Committee on Transport and Tourism will discuss the issue in committee later this year.
- There will be a discussion on the financial preconditions for market access for airlines.
- Nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the European Union in the last nine years.
- The European Parliament and the European Commission should adopt principles for the legal protection of passengers and clients of bankrupt airlines.
- They should also debate the proposal on a reserve compensation fund.
- The Commission recommends that where an airline goes bankrupt, governments should immediately return money to the airline's passengers.
- There was a problem at Bratislava airport when SkyEurope went bankrupt.
- Ronald Schranz expressed regret at the inconvenience for the passengers.
- The proposal of the Commissioner is to introduce the idea of 'sky solidarity', which would incorporate the principle of joint responsibility of airlines for passengers.
- SkyEurope collapsed, which affected 280,000 passengers who had bought air tickets.
- The Commission will consider introducing compulsory insurance against bankruptcy for airlines.
- The EU has seen a major expansion of low-cost carriers in air transport and fiercer competition between EU airlines thanks to liberalisation measures.
- There is a legal vacuum for passengers who buy their flight tickets on the Internet.
- Young people and people on the lowest incomes are particularly affected by this phenomenon.
- The air transport sector has experienced an unprecedented crisis leading to a significant reduction in air travel in the last few months.
- The European Commission needs to introduce legislative measures to protect passengers if the airline they bought their ticket from goes bankrupt.
- There have been 79 airline bankruptcies in Europe between 2000 and 2008.
- 41% of the airlines that went bankrupt between 2005 and 2008 operated regional flights.
- European Union Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package holidays protects passengers if the tour operator goes into liquidation.
- It does not protect them for airline tickets sold on an individual basis.
- SkyEurope became insolvent and presented a bankruptcy petition a month ago.
- SkyEurope was still selling tickets for its flights the day before presentation of the bankruptcy petition.
- 77 airlines have gone bankrupt around the world since 2000.
- Tajani wants the Commission to present principles for the protection of consumers from the negative consequences of possible airline bankruptcies.
- The European Parliament and the Commission have acted in unison to launch a set of initiatives in response to the crisis.
- The European Commission and Parliament have worked to create a new completely private airline model.
- The principle must remain that of safeguarding the travelling public when they suffer a loss, in other words, when they can't board their flight.
- People are making their own travel arrangements without using travel agencies.
- Low-cost airlines have been the winners from this trend over the last decade.
- The regular bankruptcy of travel agencies used to be a cause for concern in Hungary.
- We need to focus on tightening the rules on setting up companies and tightening the system for financial and operating accounts.
