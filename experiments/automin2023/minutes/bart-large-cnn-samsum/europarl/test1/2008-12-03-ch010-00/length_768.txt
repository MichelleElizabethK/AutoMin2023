SUMMARY
- The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of Greens/European Free Alliance propose postponing the vote on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic.
- Last May, an official delegation from the European Parliament went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza.
- They unanimously adopted a statement that the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations.
- Since then, no significant signs of good faith have been apparent.
- The European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs de Keyser's report on the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with Israel.
- The issue will be kept on the agenda for the present plenary, as the Conference of Presidents of the political groups decided.
