SUMMARY
- There is a problem with the electronic vote-counting procedure.
- The announcement board does not show the exact results of the vote, so people can't see how many people voted for or against.
- People are asking for a split vote at the semicolon on Amendment 51.
- 90% of those voting were in favour of the European Parliament's report on energy solidarity, a solidarity in a wider political context and protection for the environment.
- The report and the vote should give a clear signal to the authorities in the European Union not to ignore the views of European Parliament.
