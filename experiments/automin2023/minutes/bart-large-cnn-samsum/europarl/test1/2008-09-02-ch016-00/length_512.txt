SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the report (2008/2038) on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men.
- Eva-Britt Svensson is not recommending any new legislation in this area, neither at EU nor at national level.
- The measures she proposes refer to national, self-regulating bodies which already exist and represent producers, advertisers and consumers.
- In the future it will be impossible to sell products which have a gender-discriminatory or gender-stereotyped message.
- People will start to refuse to buy products which use this kind of advertising.
- Consumers will favour companies that have a conscious advertising policy.
- The EP and the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, have addressed an issue on how marketing and advertising affects equality between men and women.
- Advertising plays an important role in the financing of the media.
- It reduces the cover price of magazines and newspapers and ensures that audiovisual content is available free to consumers.
- There have been a lot of bans or controls on advertising in the past.
- Media Commissioner Frida Ghitis is worried about the impact on the industry and on the general public.
- The fashion industry has stopped its 'porno-chic' campaigns, which stigmatised women as pure sex objects.
- There is no conclusive research that links stereotyping with gender inequality.
- The Commission supports the positive recommendations made in the EP report.
- Media Commissioner has been pleading for courses in schools on media literacy for nine years.
- The European People's Party has submitted amendments to this report to correct a number of totalitarian aberrations which run counter to the principle of a free society.
- The EPP will vote against the amendments and paragraphs presented by the communists as they cast aspersions of widespread chauvinism and sexism among workers in the marketing and advertising industry.
- The report is not as anodyne as the late hour suggests.
- Marketing and advertising contribute to the creation of social constructs that sometimes have adverse effects.
- The purpose of the report is to encourage the actors in this sector to improve existing self-regulation systems and cooperate with authorities to improve the codes of good practice.
- According to PERSON493, women are not just interested in cleaning products, they are independent and intelligent and earn their own money.
- They do not let the adverts stop them from becoming independent.
- The report is too broad and the EU should stay out of it.
- PERSON495 wants to draw attention to the degrades of women in adverts on TV, public television and on billboards.
- It is one of the many results of omnipresent consumerism.
- For many people, profit is more important than treating human beings as subjects with an intrinsic value that has to be protected.
- According to the European Union, equality between women and men is one of the values and goals of the EU.
- Discrimination in advertising runs counter to the aim of equality.
- The EU is not doing enough to eliminate sexism and discrimination in the media.
- Europe is a Europe of values.
- Europe does not want any misogynist advertising.
- PERSON499 objects to some of the report's arguments aimed at the creation of a modern egalitarian society devoid of ethical models.
- He thinks it would be better to postulate ethical-legal control based on prior acceptance of a universal value system, founded on divine law.
- PERSON503 finds the report on marketing and advertising for gender equality very important and necessary.
- She agrees with the points of the report, especially the need to protect children and youths from negative advertising.
- However, she disagrees with the idea of a European ethical code in the field of marketing and adverts.
- She thinks the main responsibility lies with parents and teachers to teach children how to use television and new technology safely.
- PERSON507 thinks the resolution puts too much emphasis on the issue of inequality between men and women and on gender stereotyping.
- Psychologist PERSON509 proposes measures of exception from the country of origin principle to deal with the negative influence of publicity on gender equality in Europe.
- PERSON513 supports the view that parents and legal guardians bear great responsibility in the way they deal with children.
- PERSON511 is in favour of both the market economy and competitiveness.
- 53 amendments from the different political groups were adopted by the committee, including four amendments tabled by Mrs Herranz Garc√≠a.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place on Wednesday, 3 September at 11.30 a.m.
- The fight against stereotypes is one of the six priority areas of the Equality Roadmap for 2006-2010.
- Stereotypes create a scandalous situation for women and form a significant barrier to their success.
- Eva-Britt Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men is not serious.
- The report does not mention the growing problem of gender discrimination among EU citizens of the Muslim faith.
- Muslim press is not monitored.
- The proper relations between men and women in European society do not require intervention at the present time.
