SUMMARY
- The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on joint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases.
- Herbert Reul may be given the floor at the end if he arrives on time.
- He is running late and may not make it in time.
- Parliament wants to know if the Council can confirm its intention to adopt conclusions on neurodegenerative diseases during the Competitiveness Council of 3 December 2009.
- There are more than 7 million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease in Europe today.
- The figure is estimated to double over the next 20 years.
- Health research is fragmented at European level and public-private partnerships must be increased.
- The European Parliament gives high priority to the fight against Alzheimer's disease.
- The Presidency will try to ensure Parliament's views are incorporated into the conclusions that are to be adopted when the Competitiveness Council meets on 3 December this year.
- The Council shares the Member's view that a common approach should be chosen to adopt these initiatives under the research heading.
- The Swedish Presidency wants to adopt in December the conclusions regarding the measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases without waiting for Parliament's view on this issue.
- Parliament's position is vital to take into account when drafting the Council's conclusions.
- Parliament must be involved in all initiatives relating to future joint programming in the field of research.
- Parliament would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project.
- They want their opinion to be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council's deliberations and a more certain legal basis defined so that Parliament can be fully involved.
- They call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures.
- Today the Council is debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases.
- Next time the Council should also be debating a directive on this subject.
- The Group of the United European Left - Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion calling for the research results to be made publicly available, but the wording of the motion is wrong.
- PERSON181 is happy that the Council is moving forward.
- He hopes the Council will take on board the ideas in the resolutions that they are going to vote on tomorrow.
- He believes that there is a need to have the right balance between mitigation and adaptation.

- PERSON182 supports the political issue of joint programming of research on neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's disease.
- He would like to know if what they recommend will be taken into account or not.
- In Northern Ireland, there are 16,000 people suffering from dementia.
- PERSON185 welcomes the initiatives and the actions undertaken at European level to combat neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer's disease.
- She is concerned about the implementation of this joint programming tool in terms of bureaucratic complexity and delays in administrative procedures.
- The number of Alzheimer's cases worldwide is predicted to grow from 35 million today to 107 million cases in 2050.
- Parliament has a significant role to play in how research in neurodegenerative diseases will be done.
- There are ongoing discussions between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the welfare of animals used in scientific experimentation.
- People need research in this area in order to do the things that have been spoken about to prevent, and to treat people who may be affected by these diseases.
- PERSON189 takes the problem of combating neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's, seriously.
- She believes the main approach should be in the field of prevention and not medication.
- Member States should be encouraged to set up monitoring centres for patients and their carers, secure equal scientific participation by the Member States in this research endeavour by the European Union, and control the budget for this issue.
- The Commission's pilot initiative aims to mobilise the best researchers to attempt to understand, cure and prevent both Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases.
- The Council intends to adopt conclusions on this on 3 December.
- The vote will take place tomorrow.
- A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled.
- PERSON990 welcomes the proposal for a recommendation of the Commission on joint programming of research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases.
- The Commission's communication to Parliament offers an optimistic analysis of the expected benefits of cooperation in research among Member States.
- It will be paramount for the research results to be used to inform the population about the ways of supporting mental health.
- PERSON989 supports the proposed pilot project for joint programming of research activities in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.
- Neurodegeneration diseases affect more than seven million citizens of the European Union.
- Most of the research effort in this field is carried out by Member States.
- Article 182(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU provides a legal basis for future joint programming initiatives.
- There are more than 7 million Alzheimer's patients in Europe and the number is expected to double in the next decade.

- Medical science still does not fully understand the causes of the disease.
- There are promising findings from research, but coordinated efforts are needed to achieve a breakthrough.
- Community programming is a good idea.
