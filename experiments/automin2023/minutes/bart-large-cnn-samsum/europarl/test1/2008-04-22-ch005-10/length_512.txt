SUMMARY
- There was an error with the numbers, so the roll-call vote on paragraph 65, except for indent 4 has to be re-arranged.
- There was no vote on indent 5.
- The Member's objection may have been misunderstood and the vote on Paragraph 65, fifth indent was changed to reflect that.
- PERSON110 points out that the people who prepared the voting lists were aware of the linguistic problems, so that the marks that you have in the voting list already take into account the different linguistic problems.
- In any case, the vote was clear, so there is no problem at all.
