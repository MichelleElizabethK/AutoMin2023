SUMMARY
- Rule 45(2) of the Rules of Procedure was recently amended to prohibit amendments to motions for resolutions contained in own-initiative reports.
- If a Parliamentary group wishes to amend one line or one paragraph of the report, it has to table a separate alternative motion for a resolution.
- This makes it difficult to reach agreements between political groups.
- The Mikko report on concentration and pluralism in the media is the first report approved under this procedure.
- The People's Party was one of the proponents of the rule.
- PERSON103 gives Mr Cohn-Bendit leave to speak, but then they have to proceed to the vote.
- If they have made a questionable decision, they have the right to amend it themselves, but the amendment must be made in accordance with the proper procedures.
