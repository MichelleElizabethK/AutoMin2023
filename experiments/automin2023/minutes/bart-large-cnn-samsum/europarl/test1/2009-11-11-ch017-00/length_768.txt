SUMMARY
- The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC.
- PERSON150 is the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
- It is a privilege for him to present the question on behalf of all the political groups on the committee and the coordinators.
- The transposition on 28 December is just the start of the process of removing obstacles.
- Every country will have to come up with a list of proposals which discriminate against other countries and justify them in the public interest.
- The Council wants to know from the Council what support they are giving to that process.
- They also want to see the list of regulations and internal statutes that Member States want to retain.
- The free movement of services is one of the cornerstones of the internal market.
- It accounts for 60-70% of the EU's economy and employment.
- The Services Directive is to be transposed by 28 December.
- Next week, the Swedish Presidency is holding a ministerial meeting on the subject of e-governance.
- The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection hopes Member States will be able to implement the Services Directive in time.
- The Directive is extremely wide-ranging and requires a number of measures to be taken by the Member States.
- It will take time to put this in place and authorities will need to be trained with regard to their new duties.

- The European Parliament has asked about the implementation of the Services Directive.

- Parliament's debate on the Services Directive is an important one.
- Some Member States are using the transposition of the Directive to destroy the balance that they have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as envisaged in the Directive.
- The European Commission's Handbook was not very helpful and provided an interpretation that was incorrect.
- The Commission's response to the transposition of the Services Directive is discouraging and disappointing.
- In Rhineland-Palatinate, the individual Federal LÃ¤nder are currently transposing this directive.
- In most countries, the directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010.
- In Poland, despite the crisis and difficulties with transposition, it has been possible to draft a law on services based on liberalisation.

- The Nordic labour market model is based on agreements between the social partners.
- It does not work if one of the partners does not have a representative in place with whom negotiations can be carried out.
- The right to negotiate, enter into and apply collective agreements and take industrial action would not be affected by the Services Directive.
- The Directive was adopted three years ago and the period given to Member States to adapt their national laws and remove obstacles has come to an end.
- It is time to assess what state we are now in.
- There is general agreement that the Services Directive is very important and that it is urgent to implement it as soon as possible.
