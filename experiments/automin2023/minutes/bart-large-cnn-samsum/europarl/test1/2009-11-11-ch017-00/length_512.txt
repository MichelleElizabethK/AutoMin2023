SUMMARY
- The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC.
- PERSON150 is the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
- He presents the question on behalf of all the political groups on the committee and the coordinators.
- There are hundreds of legislative proposals or pieces of legislation in different countries that have had to be amended as a result of this proposal.
- The Commission has played a leading role in managing and coordinating the whole process among Member States of transposing this legislation.
- Cecilia Malmström, the Minister here tonight, impressed the committee with the work that Sweden was doing when they went to visit Sweden in September.
- The transposition on 28 December is just the start of the process of removing obstacles.
- Every country will have to come up with a list of proposals which discriminate against other countries and justify them in the public interest.
- The Council wants to know from the Council what support they are giving to that process.
- They also want to see the list of regulations and internal statutes that Member States want to retain.
- The free movement of services accounts for 60-70% of the EU's economy and employment.
- The Services Directive is to be transposed by 28 December.
- The requirements relating to the provision of services that the Member States retain must comply with the requirements for non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality.
- The final report to the Commission on e-governance should be ready on 28 December.
- Next week, the Swedish Presidency is holding a ministerial meeting in Malmö on the subject of e-Governance.
- The Directive is very wide-ranging and requires a number of measures to be taken by the Member States.

- There has been broad social consultation on the proposals for implementation in many countries.
- The European Parliament has asked about the implementation of the Services Directive.
- The Commission has delivered on its commitment to facilitate the implementation process.
- It has taken Member States' requests for technical assistance seriously and it has deployed unprecedented resources to support their work.
- More than 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held and expert groups met in Brussels over 30 times during the last three years.
- Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of 2009 or in the beginning of 2010.
- Some Member States might be late.
- Almost all Member States have completed the process of 'screening' their national legislation.
- The transposition deadline has not yet expired.

- Parliament called for the Internal Market Information System to remove all the problems that the administrations of the Member States may reasonably experience in connection with the transposition of the directive.
- Parliament's debate on the Services Directive is an important one.
- Some Member States are using the transposition of the Directive to destroy the balance that they have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as envisaged in the Directive.
- The European Commission's Handbook was not very helpful and provided an interpretation that was incorrect.
- The Commission's response is discouraging and disappointing.
- The individual Federal Länder are currently transposing this directive.
- In Rhineland-Palatinate, where he lives, he had the opportunity to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land on 2 September.
- It will be impossible to achieve this on time.

- Not all countries will manage to transpose the directive within the three-year period allowed for its implementation.
- The Forum for the Internal Market would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition.

- Member States are making their own efforts to spread information about the Directive.
- There is an agreement to have a common logo to make it easier for users to navigate between the different websites and the contact points.
