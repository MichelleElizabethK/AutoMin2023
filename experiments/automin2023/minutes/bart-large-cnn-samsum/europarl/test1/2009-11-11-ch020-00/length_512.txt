SUMMARY
- Tanja Fajon's report is on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement.
- The European Parliament supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans.
- The citizens of these countries have been isolated by the Visa regime for far too long.
- They have fewer rights today as regards free travel than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia.
- The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania need to be prepared for visa abolition.
- The European Union has a political responsibility to finalise the process of visa liberalisation and tomorrow, I expect Parliament's broad support in this regard.
