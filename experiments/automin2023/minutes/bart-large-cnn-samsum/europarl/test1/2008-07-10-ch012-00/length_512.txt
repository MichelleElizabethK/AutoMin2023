SUMMARY
- There are 39 + 1 members in the current quorum.
- The eleventh name on the list is completely illegible.
- Five of the 40 signatories are present.
- If forty members stand up and request for the quorum to be established, the President will do it.
- It is the job of the President of the sitting, and him alone, to establish that a quorum is not present.
- If forty colleagues do not take responsibility by standing up, he will not establish the quorum and the vote will proceed to the vote.
