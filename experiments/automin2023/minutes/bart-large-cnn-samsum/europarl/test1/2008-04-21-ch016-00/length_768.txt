SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Bárbara Dührkop on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/.../JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation.
- The report produced for debate and approval today embodies a 2005 initiative to step up cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
- The German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis.
- National parliaments were not consulted, nor was the European Parliament.
- The report provides for cooperation in terms of exchanging data on DNA, fingerprints, vehicle registration numbers and personal and non-personal data.
- The aim is to be able to compare the DNA profile of a person with future databases of 27 national contact points.
- The Commission supports the integration of the Prüm Treaty into the European Union.
- Germany has submitted the initiative for the implementation of the first part of the legislative package aimed at transposing the Treaty into European law.
- The Commission will submit its detailed position on the amendments during discussions in the Council.
- There are few issues on which citizens of Europe agree that Europe is making serious efforts on their behalf.
- The Prüm Agreement was laborious and took a long time.
- It is a good thing that there are European agreements on the exchange of data, that national databases are being linked up and that we can use those databases to pursue and prevent crime.
- PERSON128 and PERSON129 are against the German Government's initiative and the report they are debating.
- They are concerned about the technical and administrative conditions necessary for the successful application of the Prüm Treaty.
- The Communist Party of Greece is voting against the report.
- There is a dangerous trend to erode the basic liberties for which our forefathers fought so hard.
- 4.3 million people in the UK have their DNA on the national DNA database, including 150,000 children under the age of 16.
- The DNA of innocent people should not be exchanged.
- The European Union has no standard set of procedural safeguards and no adequate third pillar legal instrument on data protection.
- Most of the measures to combat terrorism and promote police cooperation have involved the collection and exchange of personal data.
- The data protection standards set out in Chapter VI of the Prüm initiative are not self-sufficient and need a complete and general framework.
- PERSON136, PERSON997, PERSON137, PERSON996, and PERSON137 will vote on Tuesday, 22 April 2008 on the Prüm Convention.
- The purpose of the convention is to deepen cooperation between EU countries to counter terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal immigration.
