SUMMARY
- The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs produced a report on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/.../JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
- The German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis by means of a framework decision.
- The preamble and annex contain provisions which are of great political significance.
- The report provides for cooperation in terms of exchanging data on DNA, fingerprints, vehicle registration numbers and personal and non-personal data.
- The aim is to be able to compare the DNA profile of a person with the future databases of 27 national contact points.
- Common guarantees must be laid down for the protection of data and the right of defence of suspects and guilty parties.
- The Commission supports the integration of the Prüm Treaty into the European Union.
- Germany has submitted the initiative for the implementation of the first part of the legislative package aimed at transposing the Treaty into European law.
- The Commission will submit its detailed position on the amendments during discussions in the Council.
- There are few issues on which citizens of Europe agree that Europe is making serious efforts on their behalf.
- The Prüm Agreement was laborious and took a long time.
- It is a good thing that there are European agreements on the exchange of data, that national databases are being linked up and that we can use those databases to pursue and prevent crime.
- PERSON128 and his group had excellent cooperation with the rapporteur.
- They would have liked to see the Lisbon Treaty rules apply here, such as judicial review and proper participation in the sense of codecision with the European Parliament.
- They also want to see a framework legislation on the categories of data regulated by the Prüm Treaty.
- Member States which do not have national DNA databases are not obliged to establish them.
- The German Government's initiative and the report they are debating are about the technical and administrative conditions necessary for the application of preventive data recording.
- The report takes things a step further in data recording legalisation, opening the door to the recording and exchange of data relating to political views, religious or philosophical convictions and party political or trade union membership.
- The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the report.
- The EU has concentrated its technical security measures almost entirely on combating terrorism since the 9/11 attacks.
- In the fight against terrorism we cannot allow innocent citizens to become targets or awkward critics to be silenced.
- There is a dangerous trend worldwide to erode the basic liberties for which our forefathers fought so hard.
- There are 4.3 million people whose DNA is on the UK national DNA database and available to the police.
- This figure includes 150 000 children under the age of 16.
- 25 000 of them have never been charged with an offence.
- People131 believes this is taking predictive policing to a ridiculous level.
- The European Union has no standard set of procedural safeguards and no adequate third pillar legal instrument on data protection.
- Most of the measures to combat terrorism and promote police cooperation have involved the collection and exchange of personal data.
- The data protection standards set out in Chapter VI of the Prüm initiative are not self-sufficient and need a general framework.
- The proposal initially put forward by the Commission was more ambitious and limited.
- The purpose of the decision is to lay the foundations required to ensure a minimum level of protection in the third pillar.
- The Commission hopes that the decision will be adopted as soon as possible, once Parliament has delivered its opinion on the new text that the Council has submitted for the second time.
- PERSON136 thanks his fellow Members for their help on the report.
- He is concerned about the need to strike a balance between combating terrorism and crime and protecting private and public rights.
- He lives in a region where terrorism exists and has police protection.
- He would like to see a European police permit.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008.
- PERSON997 is in favour of a common database of all the necessary tools to fight terrorism and cross-border crime.
- The Prüm Convention will strengthen security within Europe.
- There needs to be greater cooperation between the border control authorities, customs, the police and the security authorities to improve the safety of Europeans.
