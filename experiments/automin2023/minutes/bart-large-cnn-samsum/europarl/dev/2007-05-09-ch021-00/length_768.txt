SUMMARY
- The report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the public health consequences of the 1968 Thule crash (petition 720/2002) follows on well from the last debate on the general nature of the Euratom Treaty past, present and future.
- Thule workers working at the American base at Thule were exposed to radiation after the crash of a B-52 bomber carrying weapons-grade plutonium in January 1968.
- PERSON222 is the petitioner in the case concerning the rights of the Thule workers under Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996.
- The Directive lays down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.
- There is a right under the Directive for medical monitoring of the survivors, proper surveillance and intervention measures.
- The Commission has studied the case closely for the past five years and has cooperated with the Committee on Petitions and its rapporteur.
- The Commissioner offers his sympathy to the petitioners and workers, but they do not need it.
- They want the European Commission to help them achieve a solution on their behalf.
- The solution will not come through sympathy, but through the determination to ask the Danish Government to acquiesce to the request for information.
- The Commission's response reinforces Euro-scepticism.
- The US B-52 crash in Greenland was very fortunate.
- The relevant authorities were ill-prepared and did not deal with the problem properly.
- The Danish Government refused to provide access to the relevant environmental radiation records needed to estimate the radiation doses received by affected workers.
- The best way to deal with nuclear weapons is not to have them.
- In 1968, a US aircraft crashed with nuclear weapons on board.
- The author of a petition complained that he was not adequately compensated.
- The Committee on Petitions was the last resort for people who had nowhere else to seek justice.
- The accident took place in 1968.
- Denmark and Greenland joined the European Union in 1973.
- Greenland left the EU in 1985.
- The Directive establishing basic safety standards in the event of such accidents dates from 13 May 1996.
- The plane crash on 21 January 1968 in North-Western Greenland triggered 850 metres of flames and extensive radioactive pollution.
- It took 18 years before the authorities took an interest in the health of the Greenlanders affected and of the civilian workers involved in the clean-up operation.
- The people concerned have still not been given a complete picture of what happened to them because successive Danish governments have refused to comply with the provisions of the EURATOM Treaty.
- The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the first four of the five amendments to the proposal, but they will vote in favour of the proposal in the final vote.
- PERSON230: Enforcement of rights could be done on the basis of legislation.
- The Commission has analysed this thoroughly.
- The report will be a reference document for future Community action in this field.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
