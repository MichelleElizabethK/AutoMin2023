SUMMARY
- The report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the public health consequences of the 1968 Thule crash (petition 720/2002) follows on well from the last debate on the general nature of the Euratom Treaty past, present and future.
- Thule workers working at the American base at Thule were exposed to radiation after the crash of a B-52 bomber carrying weapons-grade plutonium in January 1968.
- Mr Carswell, the petitioner in this case, was one of the Thule workers.
- The Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 lays down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.
- This was not a military incident as far as the Member State involved is concerned, so the Directive can indeed apply.
- There is a right under the Directive for medical monitoring of the survivors, proper surveillance and intervention measures.
- Petitioners who participated in the rescue operations after the air crash in 1968 have filed a petition.
- The Commission has followed the case closely for the past five years.
- The claims brought by the petitioners in this case cannot be based on Community law but solely on the basis of Danish national legislation.
- The proposed European Parliament resolution could be one of the elements to help such a political solution.
- The Commissioner offers his sympathy to the petitioners and workers, but they do not need it.
- They want the European Commission to help them achieve a solution on their behalf.
- The solution will not come through sympathy, but through the determination to ask the Danish Government to acquiesce to the request for information.
- The Commission's response reinforces Euro-scepticism.
- The US B-52 crash in Greenland was very fortunate.
- The relevant authorities were ill-prepared and did not deal with the problem properly.
- The Danish Government refused to provide access to the relevant environmental radiation records needed to estimate the radiation doses received by affected workers.
- The best way to deal with nuclear weapons is not to have them.
- Diana Wallis has delivered an excellent report.
- The Committee on Petitions was the last resort for people who had nowhere else to go to seek justice.
- Diana Wallis dealt with the case of a US aircraft crash with nuclear weapons on board in 1968.
- Denmark and Greenland joined the European Union in 1973 and Greenland left the EU in 1985.
- The Directive establishing basic safety standards in the event of such accidents dates from 13 May 1996.
- There is no evidence that Thule workers died as a result of radiation.
- The relevant health checks were carried out and the results show the opposite of what the petitioner and the report assert.
- The amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are designed to remove errors and unwarranted assertions.
- The EU has powers to exercise in this matter.
- Plane crash on 21 January 1968 in North-Western Greenland triggered 850 metre-high flames and extensive radioactive pollution.
- Danish authorities wanted the matter kept under wraps because they accepted American aircraft armed with nuclear weapons in Greenland's airspace.
- Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the first four of the five amendments to the EURATOM Treaty.
- There was a nuclear accident in Greenland in 1968.
- Many of the survivors have since died of cancer, while animals have been born with defects.
- They are entitled to annual health checks and access to their own medical reports under the EURATOM Treaty.
- Mrs Wallis and the Committee on Petitions have done a lot of work on the issue.
- Mrs Auken wants to amend the report at the last minute.
- There is a need for a political solution.
- PERSON230: Enforcement of rights could be done on the basis of legislation.
- The Commission has analysed this thoroughly.
- The report will be a reference document for future Community action in this field.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
