- There is an urgent need to take action to protect Europe's marine regions.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the Commission's proposal for a directive in the field of Marine Environmental Policy and a Marine Strategy.

- In the Baltic Sea, cargo ships dump latrine waste straight into the sea.

- There is no overall policy for protecting the marine environment in the European Union.
- There has been a fundamental deterioration in the environment of the sea over recent decades.
