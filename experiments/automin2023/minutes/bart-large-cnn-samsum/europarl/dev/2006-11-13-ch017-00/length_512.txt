SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann and Aldis Kušķis on the proposed Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on community action in the field of marine environmental policy.
- CS launches a debate on the thematic strategy for protecting and preserving the marine environment and on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive.
- Seas and oceans cover 71% of Earth's surface and contain 90% of the biosphere.
- Europe's marine waters extend across 3 million square kilometres.
- 50% of Europe's territory is covered by sea.
- Mediterranean is under threat from development of its coastline.
- The thematic strategy on the marine environment is based on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and a report detailing the current state of affairs.
- The objective of the new policy is a dynamic European marine economy operating in harmony with the environment.
- The purpose of the Directive is to achieve 'good environmental status' in the EU marine environment by 2021 and restore the environmental health of seas over the next 15 years.
- Member States will be tasked with developing a marine strategy for the seas in each of their regions and proposing practical solutions to address the specific needs of those seas.
- Regional conventions are invaluable partners when it comes to strategy implementation.
- A high level of protection for the marine environment is a vital prerequisite for deriving the maximum economic benefit from the oceans and seas.
- The seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state.
- The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planet's global environment and regulates the climate.
- 80% of maritime pollution comes from the land.
- There is a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that Parliament wishes to enhance.
- Parliament would like to have access to a strategy that goes beyond international agreements.
- Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with more precision.
- Parliament also wants the deadlines to be shorter and there to be a good balance between the deadlines and the demands regarding good environmental status.
- Parliament advocates the creation of marine protected areas.
- PERSON092 would like territorial cohesion to be enhanced by an effective piece of work at marine and submarine regional level.
- They would like to include the Black Sea in the document.
- They want the outermost regions of the Union to become the subject of an appropriate strategy.
- PERSON093 hopes that the report on the thematic strategy for the protection and preservation of the marine environment will foster real changes that will preserve and improve the marine ecological environment.
- In the Baltic sea, which is also known as Europe's internal lake, it is particularly important to preserve the balance of the ecosystem, by not allowing it to be further threatened, and by taking special account of the specific low water exchange indicator.
- The thematic strategy on marine protection is decided on under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
- The EU marine strategy directive will be an important new instrument in integrating the existing approaches.
- The state of the marine environment has been deteriorating at an alarming pace.
- There are big challenges, such as the role of third countries.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has done some excellent work.
- She has made radical changes and integrated ideas into the report.
- The time limits and schedules for achieving good environmental status have been tightened up.
- The Black Sea has been added as one marine region in the directive.
- There is no clear definition of European marine waters.
- The main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status.
- The money budgeted for this action is very, very little.
- Provision has been made, for administrative expenses alone, for approximately EUR 90 million per annum for the first two years and for EUR 70 million per year thereafter.
- The directive on the marine strategy must give fisheries its proper place.
- The Baltic Sea is an important EU sea, though at present it is a blot on the landscape.
- Last summer blue-green algae took over the entire sea, aided by the warm weather.
- The Commission and all of us are urged to take swift and determined action to rescue the Baltic Sea.
- One excellent project now under way is the financing of the St Petersburg sewage plant.
- The EU needs to work closely with Russia.
- There is an urgent need to take action to protect Europe's marine regions.
- The Commission proposes a pan-European integrated approach to saving marine ecosystems.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the rapporteur's endeavour to define what we mean by good environmental status in the marine environment.
- There is strong support in this House for the principles behind this strategy and for the legislation.
- The Commission was right to draft the proposals, but it needs to back up its fine words with action.
- The idea of good environmental status was reinserted into the proposals and given a clear definition.
- The rapporteurs' report improves the Commission's proposal by demanding that good environmental status be achieved by 2017 instead of 2021.
- Climate change, waste, unsustainable fishing, noise, eutrophication and extraction of raw materials threaten our seas.
- Species of fish, birds and mammals are threatened by extinction.
- Member States should set up more marine reserves.
- PERSON100 congratulates Commissioner Lienemann on her excellent work in the report.
- She has included in her report the views of all the members and of non-governmental organisations.
- The marine environment is under daily threat.
- Maritime pollution, climate change, shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and have an adverse impact on human health.
- The Directive is designed to plug the gaps in environmental policy and is an important step towards improving health and restoring the seas.
- There is a proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and amendments to improve it.
- It is hoped that it will shorten the timescale for achieving the objectives of a healthy ecology and environment.
- Europe needs to make up for the severe delays that Europe has accumulated in this sector.
- A far-reaching marine strategy is a necessity.
- 90% of EU exports are transported by sea.
- The Arctic should be declared a nature reserve dedicated to peace and science.
- Scotland represents a large share of EU's indigenous resources of oil and gas.
- The extraction of hydrocarbons in the North Sea is already well regulated.
- The amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will effectively stop exploitation of these resources.
- PERSON104 thanks Mrs Lienemann and Mr Kušķis for their work on environmental directives.
- He hopes Parliament will support the changes backed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- The Baltic Sea should be made a pilot area for the new strategy.
- Two weeks ago, Nicholas Stern published a report on the consequences of climate change and the state of the sea.
- The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe prepared a number of amendments to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- They are aimed at increasing the level of ambition, bringing stricter timetables about, strengthening cooperation with third countries and plugging loopholes in the legislation.

- Exotic species and ballast water need to be purged.
- The planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany in the Baltic Sea is a threat to the environment.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposed an earlier date to achieve 'good environmental status' of their marine environments.
