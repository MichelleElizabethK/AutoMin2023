SUMMARY
- Today's sitting should include a debate on the roaming report, but the Council has not indicated its agreement to it yet.
- Yesterday saw the installation of a new government and the re-establishment of the devolved assembly in Northern Ireland.
- The people there were standing on the shoulders of giants, such as John Hume, Lord Trimble, Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl.
