ATTENDEES : PERSON097, PERSON098, PERSON100, PERSON101, PERSON103, PERSON105


SUMMARY
- PERSON097 extends warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on REACH.
- PEN098 is sitting in this seat not because there has been a 'palace coup' within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but for logistical reasons.
- PERSON100 agrees with many of the amendments, but does not want to vote for them as it would put back the application of the regulation.
- If the amendments are adopted, there will be conciliation.
- If they are not, the Council may accept them.
