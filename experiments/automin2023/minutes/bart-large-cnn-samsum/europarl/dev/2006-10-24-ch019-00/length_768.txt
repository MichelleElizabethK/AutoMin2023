SUMMARY
- PERSON351 recommends second reading on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education the recommendation for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the programme 'Europe for Citizens', to promote active European citizenship.
- The programme consists of four areas of action: town-twinning, citizens' projects, active civil society in Europe, structural support for EU public policy research organisations and for NGOs at European level.
- The Committee on Culture and Education has added the preservation of Active European Remembrance to the EU's Culture 2000 Programme.
- The Committee was forced to cut the budget from the Commission's original proposal under pressure from the Council, but hopes the programme will become a success story.
- PERSON353 is Member of the Commission.
- He is satisfied with the quality and intensity of negotiations between institutions on the programme.
- The Commission supports the agreed compromise and encourages Parliament to adopt the four amendments.
- If Parliament adopts them, the programme should enter into force by 1 January 2007.
- The overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on.
- The House supports the rapporteur's two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease and the other at an increase by the same amount.

- PERSON358 is from a southern European country and welcomes the fresh air blowing in from the north.
- PERSON359 and PS360 are sceptical about the European Union and European integration.
