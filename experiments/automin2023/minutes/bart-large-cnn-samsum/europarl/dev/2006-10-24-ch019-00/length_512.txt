SUMMARY
- PERSON351 recommends second reading on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education the recommendation for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the programme 'Europe for Citizens', to promote active European citizenship.
- The programme consists of four areas of action: town-twinning, citizens' projects, active civil society in Europe, structural support for EU public policy research organisations and for NGOs at European level.
- The Committee on Culture and Education has added the preservation of Active European Remembrance to the EU's Culture 2000 Programme.
- The Committee was forced to cut the budget from the Commission's original proposal under pressure from the Council, but hopes the programme will become a success story.
- PERSON353 is Member of the Commission.
- He is satisfied with the quality and intensity of negotiations between institutions that have taken place on the programme.
- He regrets the introduction by the Council of a supplementary step to the comitology procedure.
- The budget allocated to the programme is less than the Commission's original proposal.
- The Commission supports the agreed compromise and encourages Parliament to adopt four amendments to the programme.
- The Commission will take all necessary steps to implement the programme as efficiently and effectively as possible.
- Culture forms the basis for society and the Commission defined the legal base for the programme in combination with the culture-related Article 151 of the Treaty.
- The overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on.
- The House supports the rapporteur's two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease and the other at an increase by the same amount.
- The resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars, and bilateral seminars are essential components of the partnership effort.
- The Europe for Citizens programme aims to improve the relationship between European citizens and the European Union.
- The Netherlands is grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his excellent report and for his good cooperation.
- The European Union has recognised that there is a chasm between its citizens and its institutions.
- People should take part in the European integration process and get involved.
- PERSON356 congratulates the rapporteur on his excellent work in producing a report on the promotion of active European citizenship.
- People who care about the future of Europe believe that active citizenship will play an important role in the continuation of the European project.
- The EU is a work in progress and mutual cooperation is for the benefit of all its citizens.
- PERSON357 thanks the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for changing the name of the programme to 'Europe for Citizens'.
- The aim is to reach and involve citizens and listen to their concerns.
- Town-twinning activities are a good way of contributing to this.
- A general discussion on European globalisation blues will also form part of the debates within the programme.
- PERSON358 voted in favour of the 'Europe for Citizens' programme, but is critical of its budgetary weakness.
- A 60% cut on the original proposal is excessive.
- All programmes in the field of education, culture and youth are underfunded.
- Chronic underfunding is due to a deliberate policy strategy on the type of Union Member States want to construct.
- There will be an end to the scandal of funding being granted outside the application system to organisations that place themselves above fair competition and are still receiving substantial long-term funding.
- The exclusion of memorials to dictatorships that oppressed peoples in the south of Europe shows a lack of respect for the victims of these dictatorships.
- Some European citizens are sceptical about the Union and dubious about European integration.
- The Europe for Citizens Programme contains many of the suggestions made by Members of this House.
- Financial support is available for places linked to the Nazi regime and also for memorials to the victims of Stalinist crimes.
- The draft document on 'Europe for Citizens' is an example of wishful thinking.
- It seeks to create a sense of citizenship where none exists.
- The European Constitution incorporating the concept of EU citizenship has been roundly rejected in France and Holland and would be rejected in the UK if voted on.
- PERSON362 congratulates rapporteur on Europe for Citizens' programme.
- He wants Commissioner Figeľ to coordinate his work with that of Commissioner Wallström to maximise the impact of the report and programme.
- In his own country there are town-twinning associations which have existed for 50 years and others which have been newly founded.
- Hungary commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
- Last night a thousand right-wing rioters attacked the police, burned down shops and threw stones and bottles at a synagogue shouting anti-Semitic slogans under the banner of the Hungarian Nazi movement.
- Mr Takkula's report rightly calls for commemorating the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes, but it is not enough to commemorate them, we have to combat present-day extremist ideologies.

- The Citizens for Europe Programme does not provide an adequate budget or an incisive enough information strategy.
