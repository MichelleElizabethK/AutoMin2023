SUMMARY
- Paolo Costa reports on the report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security.
- The aim is to provide a more flexible response to technological, psychological and behavioural changes in the fight against terrorism.
- Security costs must be shared between passengers, airports, air carriers and national governments.
- The Council has completed the third reading of a new framework regulation on aviation security.
- It is now up to European Parliament to conclude the process.
- Most of the amendments suggested are in the text on which you will be voting.
- The change to the new 'comitology' decision will give the European Parliament greater power over the general rules the Commission has to draw up after the adoption of the framework regulation.
- PERSON119: The Commission is proposing general measures and detailed implementing measures within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
- The Association of European Airlines estimates that more flexible methods can reduce costs by up to 500 million.
- The new regulation will make it easier to adopt rules with non-member countries that have equally high air security standards.
- The terrorist attacks of 9/11 and other threats have made us realise how vulnerable the aviation sector is and how deadly the effects of an attack using an aircraft or perpetrated inside one can be.
- The European Parliament's delegation worked well together across party lines with Mr Costa, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Costa in the negotiations.
- They came out of it with a good compromise deal.
- Parliament has secured a significant involvement for Parliament via the new comitology procedure with scrutiny.
- Parliament did not get what it wanted as regards the financing of security measures.
- If Member States want to do more, they should bear the cost.
- There is a need for stricter security rules for air transport.
- Parliament's enhanced role is an important step forward.
- Certain passengers from countries with identical safety measures as the Union should not go through extra security checks.
- The solution to the problem of duty-free goods and transit passengers should be made with other countries as well.
- The European Parliament and the European Commission have been debating aviation security for several years.
- The resulting document is not clear.
- The European Cockpit Association and the Commission have agreed on the preparation of a regulation establishing a common procedure for testing pilot safety.
- The text will determine how the Parliament will vote tomorrow.
- The agreement on the amendment to the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security has been reached.
- It provides an effective framework for the safe movement of passengers in a globalised environment.
- The regulation also requires Member States to maintain transparency and bear part of the cost.
- The European Parliament will play an effective role in enforcing the necessary measures.
- PERSON128 congratulates rapporteur Mr. Costa and his colleagues that took part in the negotiations relating to the third reading of the document on air transport security.
- The document is a compromise between a regulation proposed by the Commission in 2005 and the regulation adopted following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
- Parliament has always indicated that we should be very thorough on improving security for air passengers.
- EU cooperation is needed to provide consistency on this so that passengers are better informed.
- The use of biometric technology as proposed by Commissioner Frattini is in order to produce greater efficiency.
- Member States should be allowed to go above and beyond the basic security standards.
- PERSON131 congratulates the rapporteur on reaching an agreement on aviation security.
- He hopes to improve transparency in the cost-sharing between taxpayers and users.
- He also hopes to complete all the key security dossiers for the aviation sector.
- He would like to see a greater number of specific measures on the issue of passenger security.
- The Commission proposes a new regulation on air security policy.
- It aims to find a reasonable balance between the need to protect passengers against terrorist activity and the operational aspects at airports.
- The Commission will publicise all applications of the regulation unless it is shown that awareness of it might aid terrorists.
- The duty-free issue is still important and the Commission has drawn up a regulation that allows for derogations.
- The Americans and Canadians are working with them.
- PERSON134: Consultation is under way with the pilots and crew.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
- The detection of explosives in liquids seems to be well on the way.
- The new technologies will be welcome.
- The harmonisation of actions taken by Member States, airports and airlines concerning the provision of civil aviation security is an imperative requirement in order to deal with terrorist threats.
- It is mandatory to take all necessary measures to enhance the technical performances of screening equipment and apply a single check in the case of transit flights.
- The lack of transparency in the calculation and application of taxes related to security measures distorts the competence of air transport.
