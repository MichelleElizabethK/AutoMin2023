SUMMARY
- Paolo Costa presents the report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002.
- The aim is to provide a more flexible response to technological, psychological and behavioural changes in the fight against terrorism.
- Parliament's delegation focused its attention during the conciliation stage of this procedure on costs and democratic accountability.
- Security costs must be shared between passengers, airports, air carriers and national governments.
- Parliament will approve the agreement reached in conciliation so that the Commission can make an effective start on its work.
- The Council has completed the third reading of a new framework regulation on aviation security.
- It is now up to European Parliament to conclude the process.
- Most of the amendments suggested are in the text on which you will be voting.
- The change to the new 'comitology' decision will give the European Parliament greater power over the general rules the Commission has to draw up after the adoption of the framework regulation.
- The European Commission is proposing a new regulation on air security.
- It will make it easier to adopt rules with non-member countries that have equally high air security standards.
- The Association of European Airlines estimates that the more flexible methods can reduce costs by up to 500 million.
- Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement on common rules for security and common implementation across Europe's airports and airlines.
- Parliament was unable to reach an agreement with the Council on the issue of financing these security measures.
- The Commission has agreed to come forward with a separate proposal on financing these measures within the next few months.
- The terrorist attacks of 9/11 made us realise how vulnerable the aviation sector is and how deadly the effects of an attack using an aircraft or perpetrated inside one can be.
- It is important to ensure maximum security and harmonisation on the matter at European level, but also to seek a balance between security on the one hand and comfort, privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand.
- The European Parliament's delegation worked well together across party lines during the negotiations and in the conciliation procedure.
- Parliament has de facto obtained a veto for cases where it thinks the proposed measures are disproportionate.
- PERSON121 supports the new form of democratic scrutiny of the security measures agreed by Europe.
- PERSON122 supports the need for stricter security rules for air transport, with the extra cost and burdens that entails.
- PERSON121 hopes Parliament will make full use of the enhanced role of Parliament.
- PERSON123 is full of praise for the work that has been done to ensure the safety of air passengers and workers.
- He welcomes the provision in the Report which states that certain passengers who come from countries with identical safety measures as the Union need not go through extra security checks.
- He wishes the same approach is not taken with regard to duty-free goods and transit passengers.
- The European Parliament and the European Commission have been debating aviation security for several years.
- The resulting document is not clear.
- The European Cockpit Association and the Commission have agreed on the preparation of a regulation establishing a common procedure for testing pilot safety.
- The text will determine how the Parliament will vote tomorrow.
- The agreement on the amendment to the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security has been reached.
- It provides an effective framework for the safe movement of passengers in a globalised environment.
- The regulation also requires Member States to maintain transparency and bear part of the cost.
- The European Parliament will play an effective role in enforcing the necessary measures.
- The European Parliament is discussing a document to replace the regulation of 2002, adopted following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
- The European Parliament believes that the safety of passengers and of the personnel working in the field of air transport is highly important.
- The costs related to the additional measures for civil aviation safety should be incurred both by Member States and users.
- By 31 December 2008 the Commission will submit a report presenting the measures to be imposed.
- The document on air transport needs to be as flexible as possible and harmonised as possible.
- Charges for air security must be transparent and relate only to actual cost.
- Measures taken in this area must not interfere with competition among airports and carriers.
- The principles governing civil aviation security need to be standardised at world level.
- Parliament has always indicated that we should be very thorough on improving security for air passengers.
- EU cooperation is needed to provide consistency on this so that passengers are better informed.
- The use of biometric technology as proposed by Commissioner Frattini is in order to produce greater efficiency.
- Member States should be allowed to go above and beyond the basic security standards.
- PERSON131 congratulates the European Commission on reaching an agreement on security in the aviation sector.
- He also congratulates rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his tenacity in reaching the agreement.
- He hopes to improve the transparency of the cost-sharing between taxpayers and users of aviation security.
- PERSON132 wants to know how passenger security is actually protected.
- PERSON133 wants progress to be made in the CESAR project to promote technological innovation in aviation and make sure that civil aviation is no longer held hostage by forces on the ground.
- PPERSON133 also wants more progress on transfers of rights.
- The Commission proposes a new regulation on air security policy.
- It aims to find a reasonable balance between the need to protect passengers against terrorist activity and the operational aspects at airports.
- The Commission will publicise all applications of the regulation unless it is shown that awareness of it might aid terrorists.
- The duty-free issue is still important and the Commission has drawn up a regulation that allows for derogations.
- The Americans and Canadians are working with them.
- Mr Kohlíček and Mrs Ayala Sender are consulting with the pilots and crew.
- They need a coherent approach at European level and harmonising the rules and procedures for their implementation.
- They also need to guard against some Member States taking initiatives that are improvised and unilateral.
- The detection of explosives in liquids seems to be well on the way.
- PERSON135: The regulation is a framework regulation and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, when it is applied.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
- Written statements (Rule 142) will be required for approval.
- The harmonisation of actions taken by Member States, airports and airlines concerning the provision of civil aviation security is an imperative requirement in order to deal with terrorist threats.
- It is mandatory to take all necessary measures to enhance the technical performances of screening equipment and apply a single check in the case of transit flights.
- The lack of transparency in the calculation and application of taxes related to security measures distorts the competence of air transport.
