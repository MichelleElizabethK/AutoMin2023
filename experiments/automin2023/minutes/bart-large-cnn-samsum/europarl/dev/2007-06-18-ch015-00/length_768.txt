SUMMARY
- The next item is the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks C6-0440/2005.
- Horst Schnellhardt reports on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- Commissioner Fischer Boel thanks the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, and the members of the various committees involved in drawing up this excellent report.
- The Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks on 15 December 2005.
- There was a public hearing in Parliament on 20 July 2006 and the Commission sent the file to the WTO, setting a two-month period for comments.
- There was a compromise between the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament on the implementation of the Regulation on Spirits.
- It was approved 58 to 2 in committee with 2 abstentions.
- There is no system of categories for quality of spirit drinks, but there is a ban on flavouring spirits and a regulation on sweetening.
- The methanol content in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre.
- The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has also been reduced by 3 grams.
- The new proposal reflects traditional methods to ensure that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced.
- Poland and Finland objected to the Commission's proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label, so the new proposal exempts potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement.
- The Commission proposal was better than the compromise.
- Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council on the regulation on spirit drinks.
- The present one is no longer up to date and requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and further to the recent enlargement.
- The rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes, this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name.
- The Socialist Group is supporting the trialogue compromise on vodka.
- The compromise recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes, but it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market.
- It is vital for European jobs.
- The discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka.
- The report is important in many areas that are crucial to Europe and to the drinks industry in Europe.
- The rapporteur has reinforced the quality of the European drinks industry and the regional origin of many of these drinks.
- The rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise on the definition of vodka in the European Union.
- Most of his group is in favour of a much stricter definition.
- The name 'vodka' is a trade name linked with a specific product that is manufactured according to a specific recipe and using specific ingredients.
- PERSON105 thanks Mr Schnellhardt for his work on the bill regulating sales advantages through origin marking and similar measures.
- PERSON106 is voting against amendments that add sugar beet to the list of ingredients in vodka.
- Shadow rapporteur recommends that some MEPs from his group should support the compromise definition of vodka.
- PERSON107 congratulates Mr Schnellhardt on the compromise on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks.
- He supports the vodka definition in which only potatoes, cereals and sugar beet can be used as raw materials.
- He also notes that the age at which people start to smoke and to drink alcohol has fallen.
- PERSON109 thanks rapporteur Schnellhardt and Polish Members for their work on the issue of the definition of vodka.
- Vodka has been defined in Eastern European countries as a spirit made from grain, potatoes or sugar-beet molasses since the 15th century.
- People from other countries should respect the definition.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is discussing the labelling of alcohol.
- In the Czech Republic, slivovice is one of the traditional drinks.
- It is important to preserve the traditional definition of vodka.
- The solutions put forward in the report have been universally criticised and satisfy no one.
- As a Scots MEP, PERSON114 has an interest in any regulation that relates to whisky, but also in vodka and gin distillation and bottling.
- The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 1494/95 and the first taxes were imposed in 1644.
- PERSON114 is prepared to accept a compromise compromise on the definition of vodka.
- PERSON116 and PERSON117 are in favour of Dr Schnellhardt's amendment on vodka.
- They are trying to define products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be.
- PERSON118 congratulates Mr Schnellhardt on his outstanding report and commends all those who helped improve on the Commission's proposal to update the law on spirit drinks.
- The new regulation will help extend international knowledge of drinks and reinforce the identity of many European regions.
- PERSON121 congratulates the rapporteur on the compromise on the definition of vodka.
- Since 1989, the definition and labelling of alcoholic beverages was introduced.
- Some traditional vodka-producing countries have become EU members.
- They would like to see that alcoholic spirit beverages made from grain, potatoes and sugar beets be called vodka and be labelled as such.
- PERSON123 is calling on the House to support the amendment on the definition of slivovice, a traditional Moravian alcoholic drink made from fruit, most commonly from plums.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Feed Safety meddled in its definition, which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic.
- The European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world.
- PERSON125 is concerned about rum produced in the French overseas départements and Madeira.
- Rum is imported from ACP countries that enjoy special treatment under the 2000 Cotonou Agreement.
- The sugar cane rum industry in France alone accounts for over 40% of the value of exports from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and for 40 000 jobs created there.
- Tomorrow PERSON127 will vote against Mr Schnellhardt's compromise on vodka and for his own amendment on a tighter definition.
- PERSON128 will send a bottle of vodka to Poland's Kaczyński brothers in appreciation for their actions in the vodka debate.
- The production and consumption of alcohol is probably as old as humanity itself.
- In Hungary, pálinka, a 100% fruit brandy, was established as part of gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance.
- Business, advertising and consumer society have muddied the clear picture we had up until then.
- The Commission proposal aimed to combine the two previous regulations into one.
- Germany has compromised and accepted the term 'Hüttentee' as the German designation for 'Jägertee'.
- The addition of sweeteners must be regulated and clearly visible on the label.
- Labelling constitutes consumer information.
- Last week, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur.
- They did not agree with the proposed definition of vodka, but they did agree with acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain, potatoes or beet molasses.
- The Council has put pressure on the European Parliament.
- A high-ranking official sent a letter to the representatives of 24 Member States and the European Vodka Alliance, but didn't send it to Poland and Lithuania.
- COPA - COGECA, the European Union farmers' organisations, and the EU farmers themselves support the traditional definition.
- Vodka is a quality product with a very long history.
- Vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain.
- The Commission fully endorses the compromise text on vodka.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday 19 June 2007 and the Commission will continue to contribute to the final adoption of the proposal.
- The Commission's proposal on the Regulation on Spirits is about the equal treatment of vodka and other strong drinks.
- 90% of all vodka produced in the EU is produced from grain and potatoes.
- The current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU.
