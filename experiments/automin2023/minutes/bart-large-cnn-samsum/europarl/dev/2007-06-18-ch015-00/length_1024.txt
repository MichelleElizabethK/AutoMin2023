SUMMARY
- The Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks on 15 December 2005.
- There was a public hearing in Parliament on 20 July 2006, a report by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and opinions from the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development and Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
- The Council's general approach accommodates most of the Member States' concerns and takes the majority of the European Parliament's proposals on board.
- There was a compromise between the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament on the implementation of the Regulation on Spirits.
- It was approved 58 to 2 in committee with 2 abstentions.
- There is no system of categories for quality of spirit drinks, but there is a ban on flavouring spirits and a regulation on sweetening.
- The methanol content in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre.
- The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has also been reduced by 3 grams.
- The new proposal reflects traditional methods to ensure that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced.
- Poland and Finland objected to the Commission's proposal that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label, so the new proposal exempts potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement.
