SUMMARY
- The Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks on 15 December 2005.
- There was a public hearing in Parliament on 20 July 2006.
- There were reports from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
- A series of informal trialogues took place which led to the Council's general approach.
- The definition of the raw-material bases for vodka has been subject to considerable debate in the last month.
- The Commission sent the file to the WTO, setting a two-month period for comments on 1 June 2007.
- Commission's legal service has expressed concern about the compatibility of the solution with EU law and WTO obligations.
- There was a compromise between the Council, the Commission and sections of Parliament on the implementation of the Regulation.
- It was passed after first reading with 58 votes in favour to only 2 against, with 2 abstentions.
- Many of Parliament's proposals have already been implemented.
- There is no system of categories for spirit drinks, but there is a ban on flavouring spirits and a regulation on chemicals.
- The Commission will take great care when it discusses sweetening under the extended comitology procedure to keep it within reasonable bounds.
- The current limit is 20 grams per litre.
- The methanol content in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre.
- The hydrocyanic acid content of stone-fruit marc spirit has also been reduced by 3 grams.
- The new proposal reflects traditional methods.
- The Commission proposed that the raw-material basis of vodka always be included on the label, but Poland and Finland objected.
- Potato and cereals will be exempt from the labelling requirement.
- The spirit industry is extremely important to us, creating jobs, status, export and tax revenue.
- It has been important to update the 1989-1990 regulations to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasi-geographical indication status.
- The Commission proposal was better than the compromise on vodka.
- Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council on the regulation on spirit drinks.
- The present one is no longer up to date and requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and further to the recent enlargement.
- The rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes, this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name.
- The Socialist Group supports the trialogue compromise and all its elements, as outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt.
- They want the European drinks industry to have high-quality products for consumers and they want to protect their industry on the world markets.
- For the first time, the compromise recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes, but it allows other long-standing producers of vodka to continue to market their products.
- The compromise on vodka is vital for European jobs and the drinks industry, which employs 60 000 people.
- The British Conservatives are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river.
- Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt, myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes.
- The Council and the Commission have been helpful.
- The discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka.
- The report is important in many areas that are crucial to Europe and to the drinks industry in Europe.
- The rapporteur has reinforced the quality of the European drinks industry and the regional origin of many of these drinks.
- The rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise on the definition of vodka.
- Most of his group is in favour of a much stricter definition.
- The issue is on the table, so that it can be thrashed out.
- PERSON103 would like to see an agreement at first reading.
- The proposal for a regulation on spirit drinks infringes the law and is damaging to the economic interests of current vodka producers and consumers.
- Poland, one of the main vodka producers in the European Union and the world, will be particularly affected.
- The name 'vodka' is a trade name linked with a specific product manufactured according to a specific recipe.
- PERSON105 thanks Mr Schnellhardt for the piece of work that has been done.
- He thinks that origin marking and similar measures may have a large role to play in defending local patterns of production against unfair competition.
- He is voting against amendments that add sugar beet to vodka.
- According to PERSON106, the current definition of vodka is workable and sufficient.
- The shadow rapporteur recommends that some MEPs from his group should support the compromise definition in point 145 of the report.
- The definition of slivovice is a specific issue for the Czech Republic.
- PERSON107 congratulates Mr Schnellhardt on the compromise that is before us.
- He is pleased that the ambiguous clause of creating the impression that there is mention of a certain age on the label has been scrapped.
- The Dutch young gin and old gin remain safeguarded.
- He sympathises with his Eastern European colleagues who don't drink much vodka.
- PERSON108 welcomes the discussion on labelling, designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks.
- The EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and campaigns to strengthen young people's self-confidence.
- What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned, and will probably not make any difference to the problem.
- PERSON109 thanks rapporteur Schnellhardt and several Polish Members for their work on the issue of vodka.
- They drafted amendments aimed at protecting the vodka tradition and time-honoured methods of production dating back to the 15th century.
- The definition of vodka should not be expanded to include citrus-flavoured spirits from other countries.
- Member States take pride in the fact that long-established methods of production and processing raw materials are respected.
- Slovak producers had to replace the word 'rum' with a different designation because the Slovak beverage was not made from sugar cane using the original method.
- Consumers will be misled into believing they are drinking vodka and will stop buying the genuine product.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is discussing the labelling of alcohol.
- In the Czech Republic, slivovice is one of the traditional drinks.
- Maintaining traditional methods of producing it is guaranteed under the country's treaties of accession to the EU and should not be undermined.
- PERSON113 votes against the report on distilling alcohol into three categories: vodka, brandy, whisky, rum, aquavit and bootleg or moonshine vodka.
- PERSON114 votes in favor of the compromise, which he hopes will be accepted by the House tomorrow.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety wants to work for a better environment and better public health.
- Vodka is a form of alcohol which is dangerous in unduly high quantities.
- In Sweden, alcohol consumption has increased by more than 30% since the country became a member of the EU.
- The compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer, so the Chamber reluctantly supports it.
- The measure is designed to protect jobs, but to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word 'vodka' for existing brands and existing manufacturers, it seems likely to have the opposite effect.
- The UK Conservatives are supporting Dr Schnellhardt's amendment on vodka.
- The issue is the old equality-with-whisky argument.
- Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition.
- The aim of the amendment is to protect the consumer.
- PERSON118 congratulates Mr Schnellhardt on his outstanding report and commends all those who helped improve on the Commission's proposal to update the law on spirit drinks.
- He hopes the new regulation will extend international knowledge of drinks and reinforce the identity of many European regions.
- PERSON120 congratulates Mr Schnellhardt for his work on a compromise on the Regulation on spirit drinks.
- The compromise ensures that spirit drinks will be less synthetic in future, which means that we shall see higher quality in the various spirit drinks, and takes into account national interests.
- Some traditional spirit-producing countries have become members of the European Union.
- They are the Baltic countries and Poland.
- Traditionally, vodka has always been manufactured from grain, potatoes and sugar beets.
- Now that these countries have joined the EU, they want to be called vodka and labelled as such.
- The definition of slivovice came under threat when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Feed Safety meddled in its definition, which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic.
- The Commissioner worked with Horst Schnellhardt to find a solution to the problem.
- The current definition of vodka was drawn up before the main vodka producers joined the European Union.
- The European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world.
- The trade name 'vodka' should be reserved only for vodka produced from traditional ingredients.
- Vodka made from ingredients other than the ones traditionally used should be given a specific market name.
- The European Union's definition of rum is at stake.
- Rum is produced in only two places within the EU: French overseas départements and Madeira.
- The sugar cane rum industry alone accounts for over 40% of the value of exports from Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and for 40 000 jobs created there.
- The Swedish Social Democrats support the compromise on the definition of vodka.
- If the compromise disintegrates, there will be no special status for vodka made from potatoes or grain.
- The EU has to decide on how vodka should be marketed.
- The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could not support the amendments to put warning labels on alcohol.
- Tomorrow PERSON127 will vote against Mr Schnellhardt's compromise on vodka and for his own amendment on a tighter definition.
- PERSON128 will send a bottle of vodka to Poland's Kaczyński brothers in appreciation for their actions in the vodka debate.
- The production and consumption of alcohol is probably as old as humanity itself.
- In Hungary, pálinka, a 100% fruit brandy, was established as part of gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance.
- Business, advertising and consumer society have muddied the clear picture we had up until then.
- The Commission proposal aimed to combine the two previous regulations into one.
- Germany has compromised and accepted the term 'Hüttentee' as the German designation for 'Jägertee'.
- The addition of sweeteners must be regulated and clearly visible on the label.
- Labelling constitutes consumer information.
- Last week, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur.
- They did not agree with the proposed definition of vodka, but they supported acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain, potatoes or beet molasses.
- This was the amendment that PERSON132 tabled together with his colleague Mr Stubb.
- PERSON133 congratulates rapporteur on his report.
- The report and the debate provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members.
- The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product.
- Additives are and must be controlled, but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recommended that vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain.
- Vodka is a quality product with a long history and should be safeguarded in the same way as whisky, cognac and all other spirits in Europe.
- The notion that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived.
- The Commission has full support for the compromise text on vodka.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday 19 June 2007.
- The Commission will continue to contribute constructively to the final adoption of the proposal as soon as the underlying conditions are met.
- The debate is closed.
- The Commission's proposal on the Regulation on Spirits is about the equal treatment of vodka and other strong drinks.
- 90% of all vodka produced in the EU is produced from grain and potatoes.
- The current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU.
