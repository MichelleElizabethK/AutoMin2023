DATE : 2023-05-14
ATTENDEES : PERSON132, PERSON133, PERSON300


SUMMARY
- PERSON300 wants everyone to have a good break, but only after they have voted this afternoon.
- PERSON132 can't be held responsible for the first part of the vote on the Barsi-Pataky report as the name of the previous rapporteur, Mr Cramer, was still on the board.
