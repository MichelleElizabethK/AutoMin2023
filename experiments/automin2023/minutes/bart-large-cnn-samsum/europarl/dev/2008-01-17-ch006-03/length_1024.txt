SUMMARY
- PERSON066 asks Mr Tannock if the addition he is proposing is an addition or a replacement.
- If it's an addition, he can support it, but if it's a replacement, he recommends that they reject it.
- In the actual text it says to replace the words 'in the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline' with the words "in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects".
- By negotiation at the beginning of the voting session, PERSON070 agreed to change it to include the words  so that it can be an addition.
