SUMMARY
- PERSON012 asks for the debate on the report by Mr Brok on the 2005 annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy to be postponed to the May part-session in Strasbourg.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to postpone the Lulling report, because they want to have more talks on it.
- The debate on postponing the debate on the report until after the Bulgarian election is a contempt for democracy.
- The whole purpose of the proposed postponement is to give the Bulgarians as much information as possible before they go to the polls.
- PERSON017 is resolutely opposed to this move.
