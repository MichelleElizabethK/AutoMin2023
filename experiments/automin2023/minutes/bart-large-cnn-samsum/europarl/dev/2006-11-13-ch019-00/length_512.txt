SUMMARY
- The Commission on Milk Quota is considering an oral question on the issue of milk quotas.
- The question was submitted by the PPE-DE Group (B6-0444/2006) on behalf of the political group and other groups interested in the subject.
- The Commission is aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes to the system.
- PERSON134 wants to know if the milk quota system will be maintained in its current form until 2015.
- PERSON135 wants a debate on the future of the quota system to take place within the health check process in 2008.
- The most promising long-term scenario for the European dairy sector is one without quotas.
- The quota system expires on 31 March 2015.
- The dairy market outlook report will be completed at the end of next year.
- It will be presented to Parliament and the Council.
- The report will look at the overall objectives and results of the 2003 reform and the sustainability of the CAP.
- The decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions dependent on milk and on the quotas.
- Mr President, Commissioner and Mr Freitas should have a debate in good time on what they propose to do about the situation.
- PERSON137 thanks the Christian Democrats, European Democrats and Mr Freitas for their reflections on the Commission statements on milk quotas.
- He points out the importance of the milk sector in Europe at the level of production, employment, investments, foreign trade and food security.
- The current preconditions create oligopolies in the sector.
- The Commissioner will submit an honest proposal as regards the limits.
- The situation when the milk quota was introduced back in 1984 was completely different from now.
- In 1984, there were large surpluses that could not be sold, and that is no longer the case.
- If EU prices approximate to those on the global market, there is less reason to have a quota system than there was in 1984.
- The situation in the European Union is not the same everywhere.
- For some regions, it is important that the quota system remains in place.
- The Commissioner's position on the milk quota system is worrying, as she suggests that it might be dismantled by 2015.
- The Commissioner overlooks the importance of milk production in disadvantaged farming areas, such as in Portugal.
- The size of the quotas should be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity.
- The Minister for Agriculture discriminates against older quota owners in favour of young farmers.
- She wants to take the cost out of present quota owners' pockets.
- The Minister wants to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases: if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years and if he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year.
- After 2015 European dairy policy is becoming snarled up.
- High quota costs have caused the cost of milking to soar.
- Europe has lost 60% of its exports within the global market and the European dairy sector has lost 4% of world production.
- The CDA member of the Dutch Christian Democratic party, the CDA, proposes levelling the milk quota at European level and a gradual quota increase for dairy farmers and cooperatives who sell their products without European support.
- The mid-term reform of the CAP has been one of the most significant reforms since it began.
- The check-up planned for 2008 will assure us that the reform is working.
- Parliament was in favour of extending the current rules to the 2014-2015 financial year.

- The European Commission's intention to review the common agricultural policy and milk quotas has raised concerns.
- Poland has a quota of 9 million tonnes of milk.
- The new Member States benefit the least from the common agricultural policy.
- Polish farmers are still grappling with the milk quotas, which are several million tonnes too low.
- Polish milk producers will disappear from the market if the quotas are not lifted in 2015, when they are to be lifted.
- There will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector concerning the quota system.
- Quotas are a very important asset to farmers in Galicia.
- Galicia needs to continue with the restructuring process in order to complete it.
- If not, removing quotas would have drastic repercussions for the price of milk and profits in the dairy sector.

- The Commissioner has said that quotas have outlived their usefulness.
- In 2015 there will be a soft landing when the quotas disappear.
- Mr President wants Commissioner to engage with them in the Committee on Agriculture to ensure a future for the dairy sector.
- In Asturias, 94 000 tonnes have been lost in two years due to farmers giving up.
- The number of farms has dropped from 30,000 to 3,200 between 1996 and 2006.
- Young farmers with high milk quotas and profitable farms are leaving the sector.
- The Commissioner is going to do a health check on the common agricultural policy next year.

- The milk quota system will remain in force until 2014-15.
- Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that in the context of the review, we should look at the question of quotas.
