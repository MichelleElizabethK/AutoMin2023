SUMMARY
- The oral question to the Commission on milk quotas is on behalf of the PPE-DE Group - B6-0444/2006.

- The Azores, which accounts for 30% of Portuguese milk production, is sensitive to the changes.
- The current quota system for dairy production is valid until 31 March 2015.
- The most promising long-term scenario for the European dairy sector is one without quotas.
- It is still too early to take the appropriate measures.
- The dairy market outlook report will be presented to Parliament and the Council next year.
- PERSON137 thanks the Christian Democrats, European Democrats and Mr Freitas for his reflections on the Commission statements on milk quotas.
- He points out the importance of the milk sector in Europe at the level of production, employment, investments, foreign trade and food security.
- He is in favour of controlling milk production after 2015 under the current preconditions, which often create oligopolies in the sector.
- He thinks it would be preferable to phase out the quota system over time.
- PERSON140 thanks the author of the question for initiating the debate on dairy quotas.
- The size of milk quotas should be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity.
- The EU lost 60% of its exports within the global market, and the European Union and the dairy sector have lost 4% of world production.
- PERSON143 wants to know if the check-up planned for 2008 will assure us that the reform is working and that under no circumstances does the Commission intend to go further.
- The European Commission's intention to review the common agricultural policy and milk quotas has raised concerns as well as hope.
- Polish farmers are still struggling with the milk quotas, which are several million tonnes too low.
- Galicia producers are worried about changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector.
- They want the current quota system to be maintained as planned.

- Young farmers with high milk quotas and profitable farms are leaving the sector.
- The Commissioner is going to do a health check on the common agricultural policy next year.
- There is a debate in the House on ending the quota system for milk production.
- The current system inhibits the development of the dairy sector and makes it less competitive on the world market.
- Ending the system is opposed by countries which have unfavourable natural conditions for dairy production.
- Some experts say the negative impact of a rigid quota system will be worse for Poland than for other Member States.
- PERSON154 thanks Mr Freitas for bringing the debate forward and the Commissioner for being here tonight.

- The quota system was introduced in 1984 to maintain high prices for dairy products.
- The current quota system will expire in 2015.
- There will be a health check on the quota system.
- The Commission will have a dairy market outlook report at the end of next year.
- The report will give a clear signal about the future of the dairy sector.
- The milk quota system will remain in force until 2014-15.
- Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that in the context of the review, we should look at the question of quotas.
- Without quotas, production would rise significantly and the resulting surpluses would bring down prices.

- Hungarian producers do not own the processing establishments.
