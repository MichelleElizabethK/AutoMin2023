SUMMARY
- Mr President is conducting business at a speed at which it is impossible to vote.
- Yesterday, the President of Parliament said it was acceptable to make a number of mistakes, getting the vote wrong, because statistically that would happen anyway.
- This does not apply in this case, because people are voting so fast it's impossible to see.
