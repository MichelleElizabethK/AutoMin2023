SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010.
- It is on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- It's titled 'The Report on the Protection and Welfare of Animals in the Period 2006-2010'.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the rapporteur's report on the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010 on 12 September.
- The Committee supports the Commission's animal-protection standards.
- It also supports the proposed ban on imports of cat and dog fur and calls for decisive action to restrict the trade in seal products.
- Mrs Jeggle is grateful for the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals.
- The Commission is working hard to develop a greater international consensus on animal welfare.
- The issue is not restricted to farm animals, but also extends to experimental, zoo, circus and wild animals.
- The proposed establishment of a European information platform would facilitate an open dialogue and a sharing of expertise and experience.
- Every day millions of animals suffer in the meat industry's animal factories, in European slaughterhouses or in the course of transport or painful animal experiments.
- Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety wants to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals.
- Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has requested a split vote on the points that make the value of animals dependent on commercial considerations.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has produced a report on animal welfare.
- The report borrows heavily from the Austrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals.
- Austria has a national animal protection act that is among the most modern in Europe.
- All animals are living beings and have a right to be kept in conditions appropriate to their species.
- The European Commission is going to vote tomorrow on the report on animal welfare.
- The aim is to reach a level of protection for animals that is as high and as uniform as possible on the global scale.
- The measures adopted within the European Union must also be respected in all countries from which we import meat.
- The Jeggle report contains many aspects necessary and urgent in order to take forward animal protection throughout Europe.
- The report calls for a labelling programme to resolve the difficulties consumers have in recognising products that have taken particular account of animal protection.
- Europeans are too defensive to be intimidated by cheap competition from third countries.
- Mr President thanks Mrs Jeggle for her work.
- He believes that high animal-protection standards must be an example to the world, especially since the country has not made a good impression as a cultural area in recent years.
- There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers.
- PERSON218 welcomes the animal welfare action plan but regrets that it should have been needed in the first place.
- He has campaigned for a long time for a ban on the practice of castrating piglets without anaesthetic and for research to replace animal tests by alternative methods.
- The protection and welfare of animals is a challenge to human culture and civilisation in the 21st century.
- Mahatma Gandhi once said that civilisation is gauged by the way it treats its animals.
- PERSON220 wants strict measures to limit the import of products if there is suspicion that European livestock farming standards have not been applied to them.
- It is a mistake to prohibit the slaughter of animals for own consumption on family farms.
- Action is needed in the field of wild birds as the EU still permits hunting of species whose populations have been declining for centuries.
- PERSON222 congratulates the Commission on the proposal and congratulates Mrs Jeggle on the report.
- He objects to paragraph 71 of the proposal that calls for an end to dog, bull and cock fighting.
- His political group is going to ask that that word be removed from that paragraph.
- PERSON224 welcomes the action plan and thanks Mrs Jeggle for her work.
- The Greens will support the proposal, with a series of amendments, and demand that the Council cease ignoring the majority of Europeans who are in favour of stricter animal protection measures.
- They believe that we must act in an ethical and altruistic manner, but also respond to people's needs and interests.
- In 2001, during the foot-and-mouth outbreak, seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EU's direction.
- The EU refused to allow vaccination, which would have been in the best interests of the animals and British agriculture.
- This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity.
- It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain.
- PERSON227 extends warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent report on animal welfare in Europe.
- Mr Titford said Europe is responsible for the slaughter of 7 million animals in Great Britain during the foot-and-mouth crisis.
- Europe was forced to change its legislation when Great Britain joined the European Union.
- Vaccination should be a valid instrument for improved animal welfare.
- The House has asked for a reduction in the duration of transport involving animals intended for slaughter.
- The future of animal husbandry in the EU lies in local production and short distances for animal transport and in consumer protection with animals reared in natural conditions.
- A maximum time limit of eight hours for the transport of animals is a reasonable demand.
- The consumer must have the choice and be able to see the labels and be sure of that production.
- Consumers have to be confident of the labelling and reduce the number of animals used for testing.
- Mr President congratulates the rapporteur on her report on reared animal farming.
- If the measures in the report are applied, European livestock farmers will have higher production costs.
- They will have to control the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union.
- Mr President would like stricter controls on wild animal hunting.
- Mr President thanks rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for her work on animal welfare.
- The European Union has been a pioneer in the field of animal welfare and it is important that it be respected by all of the European Union countries.
- The Parliament will vote against paragraph 71 introduced by Socialist Party members.
- PERSON234 welcomes the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals and congratulates Mrs Jeggle on her report.
- The public's desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing.
- A simple, precise 'EU label' for animal protection could help harmonise the currently diverging systems of animal-protection labelling.
- Mr Holm argued that competition is incompatible with animal welfare.
- Mr Kyprianou, Mr Tarabella and Ms Resetarits argued that high animal welfare standards should be promoted as one of Europe's competitive advantages.
- The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am.
- There are big differences between EU Member States when it comes to animal protection.
- The June List is opposed to having an animal protection authority under the auspices of the EU.
- It is difficult to strike a balance between decision-making at EU level and at national, regional or local levels.
