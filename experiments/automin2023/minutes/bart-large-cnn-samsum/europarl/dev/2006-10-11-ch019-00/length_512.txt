SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010.
- The report was adopted unanimously by the House on 12 September.
- The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities spread across different Commission services, councils and policy areas and structure them according to uniform guidelines.
- The baseline report for the 2006-2010 period is not intended to detail any specific individual measures.
- The report makes an emphatic call for proper application and enforcement of the existing rules on animal protection.
- The need for accession countries to adapt their legislation as a matter of urgency has been emphasised.
- Commissioner Kyprianou is currently in Brazil.
- Mrs Jeggle is grateful for the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals.
- The Commission is working hard to develop a greater international consensus on animal welfare.
- The issue is not restricted to farm animals, but also extends to experimental, zoo, circus and wild animals.
- The proposed establishment of a European information platform would facilitate an open dialogue and a sharing of expertise and experience.
- More research is needed to address current knowledge gaps and strengthen the scientific basis for EU policies.
- Animal welfare is an issue of major importance for EU citizens.
- The Commission will consult widely during the coming months.
- Every day millions of animals suffer in the meat industry's animal factories, in European slaughterhouses or in the course of transport or painful animal experiments.
- Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety wants to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals.
- Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has requested a split vote on the points that make the value of animals dependent on commercial considerations.
- The rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has produced a report on animal welfare.
- The report borrows heavily from the Austrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals.
- Austria has a national animal protection act that is among the most modern in Europe.
- All animals are living beings and have a right to be kept in conditions appropriate to their species.
- The European Commission is going to vote tomorrow on the report on animal welfare.
- The aim is to reach a level of protection for animals that is as high and as uniform as possible on the global scale.
- The measures adopted within the European Union must also be respected in all countries from which we import meat.
- The Jeggle report contains many aspects necessary and urgent in order to take forward animal protection throughout Europe.
- The report calls for a labelling programme to resolve the difficulties consumers have in recognising products that have taken particular account of animal protection.
- Europeans are too defensive to be intimidated by cheap competition from third countries.
- Mr President thanks Mrs Jeggle for her work.
- He believes that high animal-protection standards must be an example to the world, especially since the country has not made a good impression as a cultural area in recent years.
- There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers.
- PERSON218 welcomes the animal welfare action plan, but regrets that it should have been needed in the first place.
- He has campaigned for a long time for a ban on castrating piglets without anaesthetic and more active support for research to replace animal tests by alternative methods.
- A number of sound amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have been voted out by Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
- The protection and welfare of animals is a challenge to human culture and civilisation in the 21st century.
- Mahatma Gandhi once said that civilisation in a society can be gauged by the way it treats its animals.
- The protection of animals should not be expressed in monetary terms.
- Small and family farms have traditionally treated their animals humanely.
- Large factory farms diverge from these standards.
- It is a mistake to prohibit the slaughter of animals for own consumption on family farms.
- The Action Plan on animal protection is an important step in the right direction.
- The EU expressed its concern about dog, bull and cock fighting back in 2003, but fox-hunting has been overlooked.
- Action is also needed in the field of wild birds, as the EU still permits hunting of species whose populations have been declining for centuries.
- The abolition of export subsidies for animal transport would also protect the environment and help the people who suffer as a result of transit traffic.
- PERSON222 congratulates the Commission on the proposal and congratulates Mrs Jeggle on the report.
- He points out that paragraph 71 of the report calls for an end to dog, bull and cock fighting.
- He asks that the word "bullfight" be removed from that paragraph.
- According to a 2005 Eurobarometer, Europeans are unaware of the efforts being made by farmers and do not appreciate them.
- The European Commission accepts that consumers need to be better informed on this issue to appreciate farmers' efforts.
- There are five fundamental aspects to improving communication with society, rigorous socio-economic analysis, solid scientific foundations, greater coherence with other common policies and promotion of European standards.
- PERSON224 welcomes the action plan and thanks Mrs Jeggle for her work.
- The Greens will support the proposal, with a series of amendments, and demand that the Council cease ignoring the majority of Europeans who are in favour of stricter animal protection measures.
- They believe that we must act in an ethical and altruistic manner, but also respond to people's needs and interests.
- In 2001, during the foot-and-mouth outbreak, seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EU's direction.
- The EU refused to allow vaccination, which would have been in the best interests of the animals and British agriculture.
- This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity.
- It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain.
- When Great Britain joined the European Union, Europe was forced to change its legislation.
- Europe was no longer allowed to vaccinate for foot-and-mouth disease.
- Vaccination is the best form of animal welfare in Europe.
- The House has asked for a reduction in the duration of transport involving animals intended for slaughter, but the Council has not taken this on board.
- Parliament wants to put the issue on the agenda.
- PERSON228 congratulates the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for her report on animal welfare.
- He believes that the aims stated in the report are achievable, but society needs to be more sensitive to the issue and spread awareness more widely.
- The future lies in local production and short distances for animal transport and in consumer protection of animals reared in natural conditions.
- It is essential that we look after animals in Europe.
- Europe has a good record of high production standards, but we need to be more consumer-driven.
- Consumers have to be confident of the labelling and reduce the number of animals used for testing.
- The UK Government slaughtered millions of animals unnecessarily because of foot-and-mouth disease.
- Mr President congratulates the rapporteur on her report on reared animal farming.
- If the measures in the report are applied, European livestock farmers will have higher production costs.
- They will have to control the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union.
- Mr President would like stricter controls on wild animal hunting.
- Mr President thanks rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for her work on animal welfare.
- The European Union has been a pioneer in the field of animal welfare and it is important that it be respected by all of the European Union countries.
- The Parliament will vote against paragraph 71 introduced by Socialist Party members.
- PERSON234 welcomes the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals and congratulates Mrs Jeggle on her report.
- The public's desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing.
- A simple, precise 'EU label' for animal protection could help harmonise the currently diverging systems of animal-protection labelling.
- The debate on animal welfare has been concluded.
- The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
- Written statements (Rule 142) will be read out before the vote.
- The Treaty does not allow the Community to act in respect of the use of animals in cultural and traditional events such as bullfighting.
- The June List sees the EU as a union of values, where ethical issues in relation to animals are important.
- The June List is opposed to having an animal protection authority under the auspices of the EU.
- The existing structures in the EU Member States should be sufficient.
