- PERSON401 wants the European Parliament to issue guidelines on the attitude of Member States to reputable and well-established gambling operators who want to operate in other EU countries.

- Member States should be allowed to handle the issue according to their own traditions.
- The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, and we expect it to take its role seriously.

- Gambling is currently subject to regulation in the majority of European Member States.

- The Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling, but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling.

- The European Union needs to regulate casinos, lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet.

- The Commission recently published a study on its behalf by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law.
- Member States should ban gambling for everybody and allow no gambling at all in their Member States.
- The point made by Mrs McCarthy about international standards for online gambling is quite a good idea in itself, but first some form of consensus would be needed among the 25 Member States, which is unlikely to happen.
- PERSON414 would like to go in that direction, but his experience tells him that it would be very difficult.
- He thinks that harmonisation of this area would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world, because it is not possible.
- Some Member States have introduced legislation preventing Europeans from using Internet gambling sites run by companies registered in other European Union countries.
