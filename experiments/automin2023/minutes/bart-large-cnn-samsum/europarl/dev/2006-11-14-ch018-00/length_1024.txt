- PERSON406: Gambling activities, including lotteries and bets, should be left out of the scope of the Services Directive.
- PERSON408: The Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling, but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling in the majority of Member States.
- The exclusion of gambling from the Services Directive needs to be clarified.
- Online gambling deserves special attention from the Commission and Parliament.
