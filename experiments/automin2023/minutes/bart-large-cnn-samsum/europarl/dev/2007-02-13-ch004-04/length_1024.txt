ATTENDEES : PERSON043


SUMMARY
- PERSON043 asks for the floor to discuss the negotiations between the Council and the Commission.
- The Commission wants to reject the Commission's own proposals without proposing anything else to put in its place.
- If the proposals are not accepted, the Commission and the Council will be putting the brakes on and throwing Euro-sceptics a juicy issue for 2009.
