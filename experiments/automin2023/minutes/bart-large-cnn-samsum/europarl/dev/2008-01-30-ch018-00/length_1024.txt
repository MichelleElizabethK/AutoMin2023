- PERSON094: The Council did not discuss the installation of the US anti-missile defence system on the territory of the European Union.

- The European Parliament wants to focus on the implications for the security of Europe.
- PERSON097 is concerned about the development of the Air Missile System.
- The European Parliament needs to take up the issue in Parliament and monitor what is happening in the Czech Republic and Poland.
- The Czech Republic is sceptical about developing the system.
- If the system goes through, it will have an impact on relations with Russia.

- A majority of the European Parliament says 'No' to the anti-missile system.
- PERSON109: This issue is not only about increasing the security of the Czech Republic and Poland, but also about the whole of Europe.
- The Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation of May 1997 is valid.
- The Helsinki Process would reduce the presence of military systems in Europe.
- There are American bases in 18 European countries.
- If the new ones were added, the total would rise to 20.
