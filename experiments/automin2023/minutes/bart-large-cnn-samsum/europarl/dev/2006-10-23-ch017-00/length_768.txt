SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women's immigration: the role and place of immigrant women in the European Union.
- The report is titled "Women's Immigration: The Role and Place of Immigrant Women in the EU".
- According to the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, there is an increase in the number of women immigrating to the EU.
- They account for 54% of all immigrants.
- They suffer discrimination on the labour market and in education.
- They are victims of cultural and religious stereotypes.
- They also suffer from forced marriages and crimes of honour.
- PERSON114 congratulates the rapporteur on the report on access to the labour market and the Lisbon Strategy.
- She supports the emphasis on the integration of immigrant women and language learning.
- She is concerned about cases in which women are made to wear submissive symbols of their female status.
- According to the European directive on family reunification, PERSON114 will pay special attention to the prevention of forced marriages and female genital mutilation.
- Discrimination against women should count as grounds for refugee status for the first time.
- PERSON114 has doubts about giving illegal immigrants the same rights as legal immigrants.
- PERSON115 takes the floor to endorse Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report on women's rights.
- She believes that women migrants are a somewhat special case.
- She hopes that the report will be adopted by a large majority within Parliament and that the ambitious proposals it contains will not go unheeded.
- The report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou puts wind in the sails of women's rights, particularly the rights of women immigrants.
- People are grateful for the report.
- They want to see language courses for migrant women made compulsory.
- They also want women to acquire a legal status independent of that of their husbands.
- PERSON119 congratulates the rapporteur on her excellent work.
- The main rights that must be guaranteed to women migrants are that of preventing and combating honour crimes, forced marriages, genital mutilation or any other form of violent constraint and exploitation.
- The European Union needs to adopt specific provisions to encourage Member States to draft laws explicitly prohibiting some of the crimes and issues about which we have already spoken.
- PERSON121 congratulates Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her election as a member of the European Parliament.
- She believes that the report on emigration should not have treated legal and illegal emigration on the same footing.
- She also believes that European immigration policy must encompass the gender dimension and the situation of women in the Member States.
- PERSON123 is grateful to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her proposals on the role and status of both legal and illegal immigrant women in the European Union.
- They are discriminated against in the workplace, physically and mentally violated, used as commodities for sex trafficking, deprived of their freedom and passports, held to ransom by patriarchal customs and killed in honour crimes.
- These women represent a high percentage of the immigrant base and a major resource for the countries of Europe.
- They want access to information, health care and housing.
- The Commission's communication about the demographic future of Europe notes that over the next five decades the working-age population of the Member States will decline dramatically.
- Europe needs a major inflow of new migrants, estimated at 40 million people.
- The position of migrant women plays a crucial role in the integration of the first and second generations of migrants.
- Developments in the area of human trafficking and human smuggling point to a pressing need for clear immigration policies.
- PERSON127 agrees with Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report that the implementation of the directive on family reunification is unsatisfactory and that there is a need to amend the directive to reduce the time it takes to obtain autonomous status for spouses.
- PERSON128 believes the risk of female genital mutilation should be included as grounds for asylum.
- PERSON129 congratulates the rapporteur on the designation of 2007 as 'European year of equal opportunities for all' and of 2008 as the European year of intercultural dialogue.
- She urges citizens to increase awareness of the situation of immigrant women and to implement policies to promote equality and integration.
- PERSON130 considers polygamous marriage to be against the law and a serious violation of the right of women to choose freely.
- Mrs Angelilli and Mrs Morgantini have raised the issue of communication for immigrant women.
- PERSON130 believes that giving a voice to immigrant women in a more direct and stronger way can be of great help in drawing up stronger European defence policies.
- In Spring 2007 PERSON130 will be publishing a European manual on integration.
- There is a need to integrate immigrants into the society to help them get access to education and wider employment facilities.
- The forthcoming European year of equal opportunities 2007 and the year of intercultural dialogue 2008 will be useful tools for monitoring integration processes and informing immigrant societies about their rights.
