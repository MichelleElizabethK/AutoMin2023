SUMMARY
- Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has drafted a report on women's immigration in the European Union on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
- Women account for 54% of all immigrants in the EU.
- They suffer discrimination on the labour market and in education and they are victims of cultural and religious stereotypes.
- The report recognises the right of the Member States to decide on the numbers and rules under which they accept immigrants into their country.
- It supports respect for the rights of women, their family rights and children.
- It also supports the integration of immigrants into the labour market and social life.
- PERSON114 congratulates the rapporteur on the report on access to the labour market and the Lisbon Strategy.
- She supports the emphasis on the integration of immigrant women and language learning.
- She is concerned about cases in which women are made to wear submissive symbols of their female status.
- According to the European directive on family reunification, PERSON114 will pay special attention to the prevention of forced marriages and female genital mutilation.
- Discrimination against women should count as grounds for refugee status for the first time.
- PERSON114 has doubts about giving illegal immigrants the same rights as legal immigrants.
- There was a stoning to death of a woman in Baghdad on Saturday 21 October.
- The Union needs to pay special attention to women's immigration, taking into account implications that do not characterise men's immigration.
- PERSON115 supports Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report.
- Mrs Kratsa's own-initiative report is one of the most important reports dealing with women's rights since the start of the Parliamentary term.
- The situation of women migrants has been overlooked for too long by governments, despite the fact that they account for the majority of the people arriving on EU soil.
- They are the ones who forge the first links between their families and nationals in terms of society and integration.
- The report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou puts wind in the sails of women's rights, particularly the rights of women immigrants.
- The report incorporates many of the things they have been pressing for, such as the requirement that instances of genital mutilation be reported and that there be penalties, if necessary under criminal law for forced marriages.
- They also want language courses for migrant women made compulsory.
- According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, women constitute 54% of all immigrants in the EU.
- They are expected to adapt to the system in silence and without difficulty, not making demands and allowing the national labour market to make the maximum possible profit out of them.
- PERSON119 congratulates the rapporteur on her excellent work.
- The main rights that must be guaranteed to women migrants are that of preventing and combating honour crimes, forced marriages, genital mutilation or any other form of violent constraint and exploitation.
- The European Union needs to adopt specific provisions to encourage Member States to draft laws explicitly prohibiting some of the crimes and issues about which we have already spoken.
- PERSON121 is concerned about the issue of emigration in the European Union.
- He believes that some of the amendments proposed by the radical left run counter to equality, democracy and freedom of the individual.
- He also wants to make an appeal to this House and the Commission with regard to cases of mutilation or forced marriage.
- PERSON122 congratulates Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
- European immigration policy must encompass the gender dimension and the situation of women in the Member States.
- In some immigrant communities, women are marginalised, forced into marriages and subjected to humiliating and cruel practices, such as genital mutilation.
- PERSON123 is grateful to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her proposals on the role and status of both legal and illegal immigrant women in the European Union.
- She is concerned with women migrants who are discriminated against in the workplace, physically and mentally violated, used as commodities for sex trafficking, deprived of freedom and passports, held to ransom by patriarchal customs and killed in honour crimes.
- She points out that these women are used and exploited by European families and European businessmen.
- Mr President, we are witnessing mass migration.
- Technological development has meant that it is becoming easier and cheaper to travel in today's world.
- Europe needs to take appropriate measures to deal with the growing number of new arrivals.
- The Member States should create better conditions for immigrants to integrate into their societies.
- The Commission's communication about the demographic future of Europe notes that over the next five decades the working-age population of the Member States will decline by an estimated 48 million people.
- Europe needs a major inflow of new migrants.
- The position of migrant women plays a crucial role in the integration of the first and second generations of migrants.
- Developments in the area of human trafficking and human smuggling point to the need for clear immigration policies.
- The nature of immigration into Europe has undergone a change.
- Today, more women than men come to Europe as there is a great demand for workers in the operational service and healthcare sector.
- The labour market is characterised by a large grey economy in which the normal rules for pay, working hours and the working environment do not apply.
- Immigrant women find themselves in a very vulnerable situation without social and economic protection.
- Many of them perform jobs that do not provide the opportunity of becoming legal.
- Their vulnerability puts them at greater risk of being abused.
- PERSON127 agrees with Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report that the implementation of the directive on family reunification is unsatisfactory and there is a need to amend the directive with the aim of reducing the time it takes to obtain autonomous status for spouses.
- Mr President thanks Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her report on migrant women as a group.
- Migrant women are vulnerable because they are exposed to discrimination and domestic violence.
- They are also financially dependent on their spouses or fathers.
- The economy benefits when more migrant women participate in the labour market.
- The host community must be open to support migrant women.
- PERSON129 congratulates the rapporteur on the designation of 2007 as 'European year of equal opportunities for all' and of 2008 as European year of intercultural dialogue.
- She believes that giving a voice to immigrant women in a more direct and stronger way can be of great help in drawing up stronger European defence policies.
- There is a fear of reporting individual cases of violence against immigrant women in immigrant communities.
- The European manual on integration will be published in Spring 2007 in all the languages spoken in the countries of the European Union.
- It will contain descriptions of successful integration in the cities, provinces and regions where they have been found.
- There is a need to integrate immigrants into the society to help them get access to education and wider employment facilities.
- The forthcoming European year of equal opportunities 2007 and the year of intercultural dialogue 2008 will be useful tools for monitoring integration processes and informing immigrant societies about their rights.
