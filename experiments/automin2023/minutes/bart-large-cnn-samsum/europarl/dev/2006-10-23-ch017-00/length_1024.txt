SUMMARY
- Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has drafted a report on women's immigration in the European Union on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
- The aim of the report is to broaden the debate and political action on the question of immigration by introducing the parameter "women's immigration".
- PERSON114 congratulates the rapporteur on the report.
- She supports the Lisbon Strategy and the emphasis on the role of women in Europe's development and employment policy.
- She also supports the integration of immigrant women and language learning.
- She is concerned about cases in which women are made to wear submissive symbols of their female status.
- Discrimination against women should count as grounds for refugee status.
- She will focus on the prevention of forced marriages.
- PERSON115 takes the floor to endorse Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report on women's rights.
- She believes that women migrants are a somewhat special case.
- She hopes that the report will be adopted by a large majority within Parliament and that the ambitious proposals it contains will not go unheeded.
- The report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou puts wind in the sails of women's rights, particularly the rights of women immigrants.
- People congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done.
- People want to see gender-specific migration management consistent with immigrant women's right to education, health, safety and independence.
- People are concerned about the lack of integration policies for immigrants.
- PERSON120 points out the serious problem of emigration, particularly by women, due to increasing globalisation and the complexities of contemporary life.
- She also mentions the problem of increasing poverty in countries exploited by rich and highly developed ones.
- She wants to make an appeal to this House and the Commission with regard to cases of mutilation or forced marriage.
- PERSON123 is grateful to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for the positive proposals on the role and status of both legal and illegal immigrant women in the European Union.
- They are discriminated against in the workplace, physically and mentally violated, used as commodities for sex trafficking, deprived of their freedom and passports, held to ransom by patriarchal customs and killed in honour crimes.
- These women represent a high percentage of the immigrant base and a major resource for the countries of Europe.
- They want to have control over their lives and we must help them.
- PERSON126 thanks the rapporteur for her report on immigration into Europe.
- More women than men come to Europe to work in the operational service and healthcare sector.
- They are vulnerable and at risk of being abused, both physically and mentally.
- The report calls for the risk of female genital mutilation to be included as grounds for requesting asylum.
- PERSON129 congratulates the rapporteur and emphasises that immigration policy must take into account gender issues and the differences between immigrant communities.
- The designation of 2007 as 'European year of equal opportunities for all' and of 2008 as European year of intercultural dialogue must help to increase citizens' awareness of the situation of immigrant women.
- People consider polygamous marriage to be against the law and a serious violation of the right of women to choose freely.
- There is a need to integrate immigrants into the society to help them get access to education and wider employment facilities.
- The forthcoming European year of equal opportunities 2007 and the year of intercultural dialogue 2008 will be useful tools for monitoring integration processes and informing immigrant societies about their rights.
