SUMMARY
- PERSON116 wants to adopt the European instrument for promoting democracy and human rights.
- It is the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by Mr Milinkievitch.
- The instrument can operate within a country without the consent of the country's government.
- It can also work with democratic political partners in third countries, provided the principle of impartiality is respected.
- Amendment to Amendment 147 is intended to replace the phrase 'including rights of migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons' with 'including migrants' enjoyment of human rights, rights of asylum seekers, and rights of internally displaced people'.
- It conforms to the terms negotiated with the Council.
