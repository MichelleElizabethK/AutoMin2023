ATTENDEES : PERSON130


SUMMARY
- The amendment to strengthen competition policies is supported by the Socialists and Liberals, but one of the phrases was deleted from the original text.
- The whole paragraph should be added to the amendment, as it makes more sense to vote for the whole paragraph, as PERSON130 thinks.
