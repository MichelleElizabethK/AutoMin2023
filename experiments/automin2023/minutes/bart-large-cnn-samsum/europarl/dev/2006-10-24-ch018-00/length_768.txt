SUMMARY
- PERSON333: The new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response to the challenges of the present day for education.
- The Council's cuts in the general budget have had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back.
- Member States did not want that.
- The final figure was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but there is only EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective.
- PERSON333 has pushed for more funds to be allocated to the Comenius programme.
- He has also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new 'Comenius Regio'.
- The Leonardo programme promotes workers' mobility and partnerships.
- Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month.
- Lifelong learning is not a luxury, it is a necessity.
- The European Commission will publish the first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme before the end of this year.
- The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices, but opportunities are growing.
- PERSON335 has mixed feelings about the Erasmus budget cutbacks.
- He believes that the Member States should never have cut back on these programmes.
- He hopes that the Council and Member States will realise that the cutbacks on the forthcoming multi-annual programme are bound to leave their mark on programmes like these.
- Today is a big day for the European Parliament.
- They are debating and voting on five major cultural programmes.
- They include education, youth, culture, media and active citizenship.
- Less than one per cent of the total European Budget for 2007 to 2013 is available for all five programmes.
- The Member States are standing in the way of the bigger programmes.
- Lithuania lags behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 24-65 years.
- Public institutions rather than private employers pay most attention to the training of their employees.
- Public and private companies employ almost 70% of all workers.
- PERSON338 thanks Mrs Pack for her report on education policy.
- He thinks Europe needs to do more for education, research and development to stand a chance in the globalised economy.
- PERSON339 welcomes Mrs Pack's multi-layered approach to drawing up the report.
- Parliament and the Council decided to set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning for the years 2007-2013.
- The original version of the programme's budget has been cut.
- The budget allocation for the implementation of the lifelong learning programme has been almost halved from EUR 13.62 billion to EUR 7.171 billion.
- Mrs Pack has been the driving force behind the development of the programmes that we are discussing today.
- Erasmus is the most popular programme, but the new version will depend on general mobility conditions.
- The Commission should embark on campaigns to raise the awareness of businesses and ensure that the available budget is spent.
- Cross-border trade is the best way to make citizens forget about borders.
- PERSON343 congratulates the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on their good work.
- He expresses concern with regard to the implementation of the lifelong learning programme.
- He notes that European schoolchildren have poor reading skills and show a high level of truancy and many young people do not complete their studies within the time set.
- PERSON345 supports the European Union's programme for lifelong learning in the Union.
- Competitiveness must be built on the foundations of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation.
- There is no system for recruiting highly talented individuals, particularly participants in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes.
- SK is a member of the Commission.
- He supports the Lisbon Strategy and the proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology.
- The upcoming 20th anniversary of Erasmus is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation.
- Member States should implement or transpose the visa facilitation decision for students, lecturers and researchers.
- Next year Erasmus celebrates its 20th anniversary.
- Since 1987, over 1.2 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries.
- In the 2004/2005 academic year, over 144 000 students took advantage of the opportunity.
- The uptake for students coming to Scotland has been encouraging.
- However, the number of Scottish students going abroad to study has been far less, standing at 1018.
