SUMMARY
- PERSON333: The new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response to the challenges of the present day for education.
- The Council's cuts in the general budget have had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back.
- Member States did not want that.
- The final figure was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but there is only EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective.
- PERSON333 has pushed for more funds to be allocated to the Comenius programme.
- He has also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new 'Comenius Regio'.
- The programme puts new emphasis on student mobility between the ages of 11 and 16.
- The Leonardo programme promotes workers' mobility and partnerships.
- Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month.
- Better financial provision has been made for the Grundvigh programme.
- Parliament has also made provision for special grants to the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, Middelfart, and the Centre Internationale de la Formation Europ√©enne in Nice.
- Participation in these programmes is still open to all members of the EEA and to Switzerland and Turkey.
- Western Balkans have recently been invited to join in.
- The European Commission is agreeing to create the lifelong learning strategies in Member States by the end of this year.
- The new programme will expand opportunities and will bring even more benefits for European citizens.
- Lengthening education is a valuable European instrument at the direct service of citizens.

- If Parliament adopts it without amendment, the programme can be implemented on time from the start of 2007.
- The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices.
- The Commission is fully in agreement that it should not be amended.
- The first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme will be published before the end of the year.
- PERSON335 has mixed feelings about the Erasmus and Comenius programmes.
- He thinks the Member States should never have cut back on these programmes.
- The programmes make young people into European citizens.
- They broaden their horizons, improve their chances of employment and bring them into contact with others.
- They also contribute to tolerance.
- Some students from more socially vulnerable backgrounds will find it difficult to take part in Erasmus.
- Industry, possibly backed by the European Union or national governments, may be able to help.
- Ford could invite final-year pupils or students for visits to their sister factories in different countries across the border.
- Today is a big day for the European Parliament.
- They are debating and voting on five major cultural programmes.
- They include education, youth, culture, media and active citizenship.
- Less than one per cent of the total European Budget for 2007 to 2013 is available for all five programmes.
- The Member States are standing in the way of the bigger programmes.
- Lithuania lags behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 24-65 years.

- Public and private companies employ almost 70% of all workers.
- According to PERSON338, Europe needs to do more for education, research and development if it is to stand a chance in the globalised economy.
- He would like to see more money spent on Comenius and Erasmus, especially for young people, who will benefit from studying abroad.
- According to the Commissioner, people are unable to adapt to the modern world because of the narrow and specialised nature of education.
- The traditional idea of getting an education once and once only, guaranteeing long-term employment and continuous progress until retirement has gone for good.
- People must be capable of reacting more quickly to the way in which their environment is evolving and individual European educational programmes should enable them to do this.
- Parliament and the Council decided to set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning for the years 2007-2013.
- The original version of the programme's budget has been cut.
- The budget allocation for the implementation of the lifelong learning programme has been almost halved from EUR 13.62 billion to EUR 7.171 billion.
- The lifelong learning programme has fallen prey to funding cuts.
- It is intended to implement one of the pillars of the Union, namely the common social policy.
- New Member States are still bound by the transitional periods set for access to the labour market and therefore denied equal access to knowledge and technology.
- There is no mutual recognition of the equivalence of final diplomas.
- Mrs Pack has been the driving force behind the development of the programmes that we are discussing today.
- Erasmus is the most popular programme, but the new version will depend on general mobility conditions.

- There is no system for recruiting highly talented individuals, particularly participants in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes.
- SK is a member of the Commission.
- He believes that education is more than a period in one's life.
- Education cannot be isolated from research and innovation.
- It is also necessary to deploy knowledge practically and in innovative ways.
- The proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology provided evidence of this at last week's summit in Lahti.
- The upcoming 20th anniversary of Erasmus, the most popular programme in the European Union, is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation.
