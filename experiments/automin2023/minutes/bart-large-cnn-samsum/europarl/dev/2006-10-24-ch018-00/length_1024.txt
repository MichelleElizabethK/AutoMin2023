SUMMARY
- The new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response to the challenges of the present day for education.
- The Council's cuts in the general budget have had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back.
- The Commissioner has had no hand in these cutbacks.
- The final figure was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but there is no more and no less than EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective.
- The Comenius programme for schools, its university counterpart 'Erasmus', the 'Leonardo' programme for vocational education and the 'Grundvigh' for adults have been increased.
- Lifelong learning is not a luxury, it is a necessity.
- The European Commission will publish the first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme before the end of this year.
- The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices, but opportunities are growing.
- PERSON335 has mixed feelings about the Erasmus and Comenius programmes.
- He thinks the Member States should never have cut back on these programs.
- He hopes the Council and Member States will realise that the cutbacks on the forthcoming multi-annual programme are going to leave their mark on the programmes.
- PERSON337 thanks Mrs Pack for an excellent report on lifelong learning.
- Lithuania lags behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 24-65 years.
- Europe needs to do more for education, research and development if it is to stand a chance in the globalised economy.
- PERSON340 welcomes Mrs Pack's multi-layered approach to drawing up the report.
- People are unable to adapt to the modern world because of the narrow and specialised nature of education.
- People must be capable of reacting more quickly to the way in which their environment is evolving.
- The European Union has set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning, to be implemented in the years 2007-2013.
- The original version of the programme's budget has been cut.
- PERSON342 congratulates the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on her good work in developing the European Commission's integrated action programme.
- PERSON343 congratulates her and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education on their contributions to the text.
- PERSON344 questions the implementation of the lifelong learning programme.
- PERSON345 supports the programme for lifelong learning in the Union.
- He also supports the proposed changes to the Leonardo da Vinci and Grundtvig programmes.
- The proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology is an important signal.
- Member of the Commission (SK) thinks the Lisbon Strategy should focus on the integration of education and research.
- Next year Erasmus celebrates its 20th anniversary.
- Since 1987, over 1.2 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries.
- In the 2004/2005 academic year, over 144 000 students took advantage of the opportunity.
- The uptake for students coming to Scotland has been encouraging.
- However, the number of Scottish students going abroad to study has been far less, standing at 1018.
