SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the report by Christa Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides.
- The EU's policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have made significant progress in reducing the risks of pesticides.
- The main elements of the Commission's proposal for a framework directive are as follows: each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides.
- Professional pesticide users will need to have access to appropriate training.
- Public awareness about the risks will also need to be increased.
- Special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network.
- The implementation of integrated pest control ought to become compulsory from 2014.
- There is a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market.
- The European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive on plant protection products.
- The legislation in force dates from 1991.
- The Commission has carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.
- The first priority is to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health and for the environment.
- The proposal will create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
- The procedure will be shorter and more efficient.
- Member States will no longer be working in isolation.
- The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.
- Commissioner Dimas welcomes the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides.
- Differing rules in the European Union create divergent safety standards and distort competition.
- The global population is growing and food is becoming scarcer worldwide.
- Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place.
- New pests are appearing and natural disasters decimate harvests.
- Plant protection agents help to safeguard harvours.
- Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably.
- Information, education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use are at the heart of this directive.
- The stringent regulation on authorisation has been reduced to absurdity.
- Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all.
- PERSON078 wants harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents.
- The Commission's approach is the right one.
- Pesticides are essential if the habitats are to be preserved.
- Additional taxes distort competition in the world market and would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU.
- PERSON079 took part in the discussions on various reports in the Committee on the Environment.
- He thinks that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.
- Most of his group opposed the position to which she refers.
- Today 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides.
- Pesticides are linked to the development of malignant tumours, immunological and other neurotoxic defects.
- Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk from pesticides.
- Global warming will bring more pests, so we cannot increase the amount of pesticides used.
- PERSON081 supports the ban on aerial spraying and the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses.
- He thinks the Strategy is not directed against farmers.
- Amendment 3 proposes to add the term 'urban' to the Thematic Strategy to exclude people who live in rural areas.
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on a report on the regulation of pesticides in Europe.
- The aim is eradication of high-risk pesticides.
- Less dangerous ones should not be marketed any more.
- The substitution principle should be enshrined in the proposed regulation.
- Pesticides should be authorised for a period not exceeding five years.
- The proposal also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance.
- There are new rules on labelling of food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006/215.
- Pesticide passport will make it possible to trace the pesticide used when.
- Consumers will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products and high environmental standards.
- The Environment Committee came out against dividing Europe into three zones.
- The idea did not win majority support in the Council.
- There are no intergovernmental agreements within these zones to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences.
- People in Europe do not want poison on their plates.
- The new pesticides regulation will enable us to raise health and environmental protection to new heights in Europe.
- Last month Europe reduced set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production.
- The Commission is dealing with this in the right way.
- Climatic conditions make a great deal of difference to when you should spray.
- There are satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time.
- In Britain, you cannot buy organic potatoes because you can't spray them.
- PERSON084 has two opinions on pesticides and the use of pesticides.
- Pesticides are useful and necessary and without them it would be difficult to feed 6 billion people.
- The industry is focusing on the major crops, the 'big five', rice, corn, maize, soya beans and cotton.
- The Committee on Industry has made a number of good suggestions for protection of minor crops and introducing incentives to switch to sustainable products.
- The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States.
- The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied the proposal to replace Article 37(2) and Article 175(1) with Article 152(4)(b) on health protection.
- The Committee is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 152 (4) and the purpose of the proposal is the protection of human health.
- PERSON086 is the draftswoman of her Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market.
- She believes the regulation should strike a balance between the interests of consumers and farmers.
- She also believes that carcinogenic substances must be banned.
- PERSON086 is against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose a requirement for farmers to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before applying plant protection products.
- The Committee is seeking greater harmonisation.
- The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones.
- Thematic Strategy on a Thematic Strategy is a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face.
- Member States will be responsible for setting their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used.
- The elimination of the use of toxic or dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
- Buffer zones are important to protect the aquatic environment.
- Mr Kyprianou criticises the Commission's proposal concerning zone division.
- It will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and reduce their levels of consumer protection.
- Denmark has reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s.
- If the proposal is implemented, Denmark will have to double the number of pesticides permitted.
- According to the Commission's proposals, every country will approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
- This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled.
- The Committee on the Environment has adopted a compromise that allows mutual obligatory approval of data and gives countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so.
- There is a clear need to harmonise the rules on pesticides in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union.
- ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, while recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality.
- They co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.
- For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area.
- It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children's playgrounds and school areas.
- The use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary, or even prohibited, and non-chemical methods should be prioritised.
- The European Commission's proposal for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified is acceptable.
- Member States should determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it.
- The European Union is trying to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants.
- In past years the quality of pesticides was much worse and they were used in much higher doses.
- The pollution in the environment is a consequence of activities in years past.
- The EU needs to supplement existing legislation with a directive on the deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides.
- PERSON092 congratulates Ms Breyer on the outcome of the European Parliament's vote on pesticides.
- She believes it is vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances.
- France is the European Union's number one pesticide user.
- Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into the environment in France.
- Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides is a document on the need for sustainable competitive agricultural production in Europe and promoting the use of pesticides only where there is minimum adverse effect on human health and the environment.
- The most important result of the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on the human health deriving from pesticide use.
- The strategy deals with this only marginally.
- Pesticide policy should be based on reducing the use rather than reducing the quantity of pesticides.
- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86%.
- The introduction of buffer zones around watercourses around 35% of agricultural land is a problem for a country with a lot of water.
- The EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land.
- EU support schemes have been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.
- There is a general suspicion among consumers that farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products.
- PERSON097 objects to a proposal like the 10-metre rule on pesticide use in agriculture.
- Pesticides must be controlled, but the measures must be based on sound science and practical at farm and street level.
- The strident codes of practice governing the use in his country are adequate.
- The task of the Commissioner is to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production.
- The greatest challenge is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and environment.
- The Commissioner is concerned with the health of farmers and their families who come into contact with pesticides.
- Long-term evaluations provided in Directive 91/414 have not been carried out.
- There are major differences between the Member States in their practice and their policy approach to pesticides.
- The Commission should encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region.
- It should also facilitate inter-regional exchanges of experience and ensure that European laws are properly applied.
- According to PERSON100, plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture.
- The EU Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk of the use of plant protection agents.
- PERSON100 argues for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for their use.
- There is a vote on plant protection regulations in the European Parliament.
- The aim of the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices.
- The Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have satisfied the expectations of all interested parties.
- If the amendments are accepted, the consequences could be unpredictable.
- Tomorrow morning PERSON102 is going to buy bottled drinking water.
- In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground: clean groundwater.
- It's healthier than bottled water, tastes better and it's cheaper.
- It also prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water, so PERSON102 proposes an amendment to permit protection zones.
- It has received support from a large majority in Parliament and from the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, but not from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture.
- The proposal for a regulation to replace Directive 91/414/CE is unjustifiably overhauling measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.
- Farmers and consumers will suffer as a result.
- The proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991 to 148.
- Of those 148 substances, 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides.
- The Committee on the Environment will vote tomorrow on the three reports on the use of pesticides in farming.
- The majority of farmers want the European Union to help them change their practices.
- Bee-keepers all over Europe are calling for strict legislation to stop the sale of pesticides that have not been evaluated for their impact on bees.
- PERSON105 is in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment and introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health.
- Pesticides are poisoning both the water and the soil.
- All three reports require the personnel involved in all phases of pesticide handling to be highly qualified.
- Action plans, integrated management and strict import measures are positive in all the reports.
- The bans on aerial application and the quantitative use reduction are not clearly defined.
- The Slovak Republic applies on average less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare, while other countries apply as much as 8 kg.
- There is a need to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides.
- It is also a good idea to put some of it into effect immediately.
- The aim is to reduce pesticide use based on a risk-based approach and non-spray zones around watercourses.
- The Parliament is opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours.
- Today's debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection.
- The Commission should provide periodic training and educational programmes financed at least in part by companies that manufacture pesticides.
- There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection with regard to the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment.
- The import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned.
- Agricultural practices that promote the use of low doses of pesticides should be encouraged.
- PERSON110 believes that plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe.
- UKIP will vote against the EU's pestilent regulations.
- UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985.
- Syngenta says farmers should not be denied the tools they need.
- According to the Klaß report, it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid.
- Every Member State should consider what it can do itself to reduce the overall volume.
- Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach.
- PERSON113 supports the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety's proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe and the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research.
- PERSON114 supports the proposal for a risk-based assessment based on science and a 10-metre buffer zone.
- Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products is challenging legislative projects.
- The Directive should take the differences between Member States into consideration.
- Buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commission's proposals are the right way forward for the Directive on Plant Protection Products.
- There are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from fellow members of the European Parliament.
- The common European reduction target should be 20%, but this may mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others.
- The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans.
- There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market.
- In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50% since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness.
- PERSON117 supports the proposal of the Breyer report co-rapporteur Erna Hennicot-Schoepges.
- She thinks the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work.
- She also supports Mrs Breyer's proposal on the proposal on zoning.
- The 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.
- The Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of farmland, 35% of agricultural area.
- Pesticide residues are everywhere, in food, water, in the air, in our body tissue and breast milk and in the bodies of unborn children.
- Pesticides are linked to various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage to our immune systems, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system.
- Aerial spraying is commonplace, particularly in forests and vineyards.
- It is essential that growers should issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close by and are potentially exposed.
- The key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
- Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
- Poland and other new members of the EU have a different level of agricultural development.
- In Poland, enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air.
- Parliament's responsibility is to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.
- PERSON121 is pleased with the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides and the proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use.
- The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides.
- Laying down an overall, permanent target for the reduction of pesticides use at EU level is not necessary.
- PERSON121: The Commission would prefer Member States to have a margin of flexibility and set the appropriate width for buffer zones in line with their own geographical features.
- The Commission agrees to take measures to protect populations living close to fields where aerial spraying is carried out, but considers a complete ban on the use of pesticides in so-called 'sensitive' areas is disproportionate.
- The Commission can accept 121 of the 166 amendments to the Directive on Pesticides.
- It can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part.
- The Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty.
- There is no effective system for differentiating tax rates according to the risk posed by pesticides.
- The EU's current policy is to promote and support healthy eating.
- The Commission's proposal succeeds in tackling this dual challenge in a balanced fashion.
- MEPs are willing to accept the amendment to the definition of vulnerable groups.
- Imported products are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues.
- PERSON122 believes that the new proposal has been misconstrued.
- The new proposal will introduce stricter criteria, to be implemented on a zonal basis.
- Expert from other Member States will play an active part in the licensing procedure.
- The Commission would not accept amendments relating to the system of approval on a zone-by-zone basis.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 17, 26, 49, 52, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 76, 94, 95, 97, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 115 and 117.
- It cannot accept Amendments 1, 5, 16, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 32, 37, 40, 41, 46, 55, 57, 58, 69, 72, 73, 77, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 96, 98, 99, 102, 104, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 127, 132, 138, 139, 157, The Commission reserves its position on Amendment 166.
- The Commission can accept, or accept subject to rewording, Amendments 9, 11, 20, 22, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 36, 41, 43, 45, 49, 51, 56, 57, 64, 67, 75, 78, 79.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 34, 39, 46, 50, 53, 54, 59, 61, 62, 63, 66, 76, 77, 80, 87, 89, 94, 95, 98, 99, 100, 108, 109, 115, 116, 121, 122, 123, 133, 134, 136, 149, 163, 169, 175, 176, 177, 180, 183, 188, 189, 193, 199, 209, 218, 225, 233, 243, 244, 248, 251, 252, 268, 279, 284, Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals, as they are designed to kill and released deliberately into the environment and onto food.
- Only about 1% of a pesticide actually reaches its target.
- Farmers want to have a high harvest and good quality products with low costs.
- Citizens want safe, cheap products and pesticide-free drinking water.
- Using less and safer pesticides is in everyone's interests.
- There will be a vote tomorrow on the legislative package on plant protection products.
- The current rules in individual Member States differ widely.
- Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades.
- The compromise draft text would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600.
- Pesticides are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds.
- They must be used in accordance with set rules.
- A shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices.
- PPE-DE will vote for the reports adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety if the amendments by her political group are adopted.
