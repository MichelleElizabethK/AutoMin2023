SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the report by Christa Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides.
- The European Parliament is discussing a proposal on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive on the human health and environmental due to pesticides.
- The EU's policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have made significant progress in reducing the risks of pesticides.
- Integrated management and pest control are the most effective way to achieve this goal.
- The European Parliament and the Council are debating the issue of plant protection products.
- The legislation in force dates from 1991 and needs to be updated.
- The Commission's proposal supplements the internal market and protects the environment and human and animal health.
- The proposal will also reduce administrative costs and make the procedure shorter.
- Commissioner Dimas welcomes the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides.
- Differing rules in the European Union create divergent safety standards and distort competition.
- The global population is growing and food is becoming scarcer worldwide.
- Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place.
- Pesticides are essential to safeguard harvests.
- PERSON079 took part in the discussions on various reports in the Committee on the Environment.
- He thinks that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.
- Most of his group opposed the position to which she refers.
- Pesticide use is not decreasing.
- 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides.
- Pesticides are linked to the development of malignant tumours or immunological and other neurotoxic defects.
- Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk.
- The aim of the report is to minimise the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from pesticide use.
- Parliament will vote on a new pesticide regulation tomorrow.
- The aim is to eradicate high-risk pesticides and reduce the use of less dangerous ones.
- Pesticides with high levels of carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic properties should not be marketed any more.
- The substitution principle is to be enshrined in the proposed regulation.
- The proposal also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance and better protection of sensitive groups.
- PERSON084 and PERSON085 give their views on the use of pesticides and the proposed Directive for a Directive on Agricultural Policy and Health Protection.
- The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied the proposals.
- It is unanimous that there is no need for the two-fold legal basis for the Directive.
- PERSON086 is draftswoman of her Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market.
- She is against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose strict licensing criteria.
- She also opposes the Commission's proposed public information clause.
- The Committee is seeking greater harmonisation and 27 national licensing zones.
- Thematic Strategy on a Thematic Strategy is a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face.
- Member States will be responsible for setting their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used.
- The elimination of the use of toxic or dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
- Buffer zones are important to protect the aquatic environment.
- Mr Kyprianou criticises the Commission's proposal concerning zone division.
- The proposal will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and reduce their levels of consumer protection.
- Denmark has reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s.
- In Hungary 57 active substances are used, while in Poland 37 are used.
- In the UK a maize pesticide containing around 15 active substances is used.
- There is a need to harmonise the rules on pesticide use in the EU to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union.
- The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, while recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality.
- It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children's playgrounds and school areas, but the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary.
- PERSON092 congratulates Ms Breyer on the outcome of her report on the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
- She hopes that the European Parliament will support the most forward-looking positions on this question in the future.
- She also welcomes the fact that the report incorporates the amendment on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem.
- PERSON095 is sceptical about the policy based on reducing pesticide use.
- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86%.
- The introduction of buffer zones around watercourses has been approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- The EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land.
- PERSON098 is disappointed that representatives of the agricultural sector did not take part in the debate on the CAP reform.
- The greatest challenge is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and environment.
- People are concerned about the health of farmers and their families, who come into contact with pesticides.
- The intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry have been disgraceful.
- PERSON100 and PERSON101 are concerned about the impact of the legislation on plant protection agents on agriculture.
- They argue for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for the use of plant protection products.
- The EU agricultural sector's main objective is to supply good quality food at affordable prices.
- Tomorrow morning PERSON102 is going to buy bottled drinking water.
- In Denmark we have a rich vein of clean groundwater.
- It is healthier than bottled water, tastes better and is cheaper.
- It also prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water, so PERSON102 wants to continue with an amendment to permit protection zones.
- The Commissioner for Agriculture and Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries would rather support the farmers' opportunity to ruin our drinking water than protect the environment.
- There is a debate on the use of pesticides in Europe's farming tomorrow.
- The Committee on the Environment will vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer, Christa Klaß and Irena Belohorská.
- The majority of farmers want the European Union to help them change their practices so they don't have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability.
- PERSON108 proposes a further reduction in pesticide use and non-spray zones around watercourses.
- She is in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones.
- She believes the farmers' guiding principle should be: "As few pesticides as possible, just those that are essential".
- UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985.
- UKIP will vote against the EU's pestilent regulations.
- UKIP supports the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety's proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20%.
- UKIP also supports the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research.
- PERSON114 supports the proposal for a risk-based assessment based on science and a 10-metre buffer zone.
- Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects.
- The Directive should take into account the differences between Member States and should be left to Member States.
- There are three misunderstandings about the reduction target, the zones and the cut-off criteria for particularly sensitive substances, according to PERSON116.
- PERSON117 supports the co-rapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPE-DE Group, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges.
- The 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the green heart of the Netherlands.
- People are concerned about the long-term consequences of pesticide residues.
- They include various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage to our immune systems, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system.
- People suffering from respiratory conditions could be severely affected if they have no advance notice of pesticide spraying.
- The key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
- Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
- Poland and other new members of the EU have a different level of agricultural development.
- In Poland, enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air.
- Parliament's responsibility is to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.
- The European Commission is satisfied with the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides and the Belohorská report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- The Commission can accept 121 of the 166 amendments to the framework directive.
- It can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues, such as technical training and certification.
- It cannot endorse the elimination of Amendment 86 of the proposal.
- PERSON122 supports the Commission's proposal to promote and support healthy eating and to ensure that fruit and vegetables are safe for consumption.
- The Commission's main aim is to protect the health of citizens and the environment.
- The proposal will introduce stricter criteria to be implemented on a zonal basis.
- Experts from other Member States will play an active part in the licensing procedure.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 17, 26, 49, 52, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 76, 94, 95, 97, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 115 and 117.
- The Commission can't accept Amendments 1, 5, 16, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 32, 37, 40, 41, 46, 55, 57, 58, 69, 72, 73, 77, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 96, 98, 99, 102, 104, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 127, 132, 138, 139 Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals.
- They are released deliberately into the environment and onto food.
- Pesticides kill only about 1% of their target.
- People's health is at stake and economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence.
- The draft legislation is based on compromise in many respects and meets many demands.
- Pesticides are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds.
- They must be used in accordance with set rules.
- A shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices.
- PPE-DE will vote for the reports adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety if the amendments by her political group are adopted.
