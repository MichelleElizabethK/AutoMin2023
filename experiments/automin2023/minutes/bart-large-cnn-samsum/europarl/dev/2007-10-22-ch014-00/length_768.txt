SUMMARY
- PERSON076 thanks the European Parliament and rapporteurs for their thorough work on the proposal for a regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market - C6-0245/2006.
- The main elements of the Commission's proposal for the framework directive are as follows: Each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides.
- Professional pesticide users will need to have access to appropriate training.
- Aerial spraying will be prohibited.
- Special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network.
- The implementation of integrated pest control ought to become compulsory from 2014.
- There is a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market.
- The European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive on plant protection products.
- The legislation in force dates from 1991.
- The Commission has carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.
- The first priority is to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health and for the environment.
- The proposal will create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
- The procedure will be shorter and more efficient.
- Member States will no longer be working in isolation.
- The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.
- Commissioner Dimas welcomes the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides.
- Differing rules create divergent safety standards and distort competition.
- The global population is growing and food is becoming scarcer worldwide.
- Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place and new pests are appearing.
- Natural disasters decimate harvests.
- The use of plant protection agents helps to safeguard harvesters.
- The stringent regulation on authorisation has been reduced to absurdity.
- PERSON078 and PERSON080 are against the use of crop spraying helicopters in sensitive areas.
- They are also against the establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies.
- They support the Commission's proposal to harmonise the rules on plant protection agents.
- They want the same protection and same standard throughout the EU.
- Today 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides.
- Pesticides are linked to the development of malignant tumours, immunological and other neurotoxic defects.
- Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk from pesticides.
- Global warming will bring more pests, so we cannot increase the amount of pesticides used.
- PERSON081 supports the ban on aerial spraying and the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses.
- He thinks the Strategy is not directed against farmers.
- Amendment 3 proposes to add the term 'urban' to the Thematic Strategy to exclude people who live in rural areas.
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on a report on the regulation of pesticides in Europe.
- The aim is eradication of high-risk pesticides.
- Less dangerous ones should not be marketed any more.
- The substitution principle should be enshrined in the proposed regulation.
- Pesticides should be authorised for a period not exceeding five years.
- The proposal also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance.
- There are new rules on labelling of food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006/215.
- Pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when.
- Consumers will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products.
- PERSON083 and PERSON084 give their views on the use of pesticides and food production in Europe.
- Pesticides are useful and necessary, but they should be regulated on a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH.
- The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States.
- The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied the proposal to replace Article 37(2) and Article 175(1) with Article 152(4)(b) on health protection.
- The Committee is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 152 (4) and the purpose of the proposal is the protection of human health.
- PERSON086 is the draftswoman of her Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market.
- She is against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- She also opposes the Commission's proposed public information clause.
- The Committee is seeking greater harmonisation and 27 national licensing zones.
- The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development should not be taking part in the debate on the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides.
- The aim of the new regulations is to improve the situation regarding public health, but there is no clear illustration of the dangers of plant diseases and weeds which pesticides are used to try and prevent.
- The elimination of the use of toxic or dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
- Member States should set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used.
- Mr Kyprianou criticises the Commission's proposal concerning zone division.
- It will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and reduce their levels of consumer protection.
- Denmark has reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s.
- If the proposal is implemented, Denmark will have to double the number of pesticides permitted.
- According to the Commission's proposals, every country will approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
- This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled.
- The Committee on the Environment has adopted a compromise that allows mutual obligatory approval of data and gives countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so.
- There is a need to harmonise the rules on pesticide use in the EU to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union.
- The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, while recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality.
- ALDE co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.
- The European Union is trying to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants.
- The quality of pesticides used in the past was much worse and they were used in much higher doses.
- The EU needs to supplement existing legislation with a directive on deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides.
- PERSON094 congratulates the rapporteur on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
- She is sceptical about the proposal that the policy should be based on reducing use of pesticides.
- The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and found it to reduce the environmental risk by 86%.
- The EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land.
- The EU support schemes have been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.
- Without controlled use of pesticides in agriculture, we will drive more food production to less regulated regions.
- PERSON098 is disappointed that representatives of the agricultural sector did not take part in the debate on the CAP reform.
- The greatest challenge is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and environment.
- People are concerned about the health of farmers and their families, who come into contact with pesticides.
- The intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry have been disgraceful.
- According to PERSON100, plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture.
- The EU Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk of the use of plant protection agents.
- PERSON100 argues for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for their use.
- There is a vote on plant protection regulations in the European Parliament.
- The aim of the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices.
- The Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have satisfied the expectations of all interested parties.
- If the amendments are accepted, the consequences could be unpredictable.
- Tomorrow morning PERSON102 is going to buy bottled drinking water.
- In Denmark we have a rich vein of clean groundwater.
- It is healthier than bottled water, tastes better and is cheaper.
- It also prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water, so PERSON102 wants to continue with an amendment to permit protection zones.
- The Commissioner for Agriculture and Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries would rather support the farmers' opportunity to ruin our drinking water than protect the environment.
- The Committee on the Environment will vote tomorrow on the three reports on the use of pesticides in farming.
- The majority of farmers want the European Union to help them change their practices so they don't have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability.
- The use of plant protection products is essential in certain circumstances in Poland.
- PERSON107, Commissioner 108 and Commissioner 108 discuss the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides.
- They argue for a reduction in pesticide use based on a risk-based approach and for non-spray zones around watercourses.
- They are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones.
- Today's debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection.
- The guiding principle of producers and distributors should be the precautionary principle.
- Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect the crop.
- The 10-metre buffer zones will be disastrous for the Netherlands and others.
- PERSON112 thanks rapporteurs and shadow rapporteur for their work on the legislative package.
- He supports the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety's proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe and the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research.
- PERSON114 supports the proposal for a risk-based assessment based on science and a 10-metre buffer zone.
- Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects.
- The Directive should take into account the differences between Member States and should be left to Member States.
- There are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from fellow members of the European Parliament.
- The common European reduction target should be 20%, but this may mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others.
- The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans.
- There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market.
- In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50% since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness.
- PERSON117 supports the proposal of the Breyer report co-rapporteur Erna Hennicot-Schoepges.
- She thinks the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work.
- She also supports Mrs Breyer's proposal on the proposal on zoning.
- The 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.
- The Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of farmland, 35% of agricultural area.
- PERSON119 supports the Breyer report on pesticide use.
- PPE Group recommends that people living near areas to be treated with pesticides should be notified of the spraying.
- The key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
- Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
- The directive speaks about the farmer's level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use.
- PERSON121 is pleased with the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides and the proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use.
- The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides.
- Laying down an overall, permanent target for the reduction of pesticides use at EU level is not necessary.
- The European Commission can accept 121 of the 166 amendments to the Pest Management Directive.
- It can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part of the amendments.
- The Commission cannot endorse the elimination of Amendment 86 of the proposal.
- It cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty.
- It is clear that the proposed directive is focused on environmental protection.
- The EU's current policy is to promote and support healthy eating.
- The Commission's proposal succeeds in tackling this dual challenge in a balanced fashion.
- MEPs are willing to accept the amendment to the definition of vulnerable groups.
- Imported products are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues.
- PERSON122 believes that the new proposal has been misconstrued.
- The new proposal will introduce stricter criteria, to be implemented on a zonal basis.
- Expert from other Member States will play an active part in the licensing procedure.
- The Commission would not accept amendments relating to the system of approval on a zone-by-zone basis.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 17, 26, 49, 52, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 76, 94, 95, 97, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 115 and 117.
- It cannot accept Amendments 1, 5, 16, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 32, 37, 40, 41, 46, 55, 57, 58, 69, 72, 73, 77, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 96, 98, 99, 102, 104, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 127, 132, 138, 139, 157, The Commission reserves its position on Amendment 166.
- The Commission can accept Amendments 9, 11, 20, 22, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 36, 41, 43, 45, 49, 51, 56, 57, 64, 67, 75, 78, 79, 82, 84, 92, 93, 96.
- Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals.
- They are released deliberately into the environment and onto food.
- Pesticides kill only about 1% of their target.
- People's health is at stake and economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence.
- The draft legislation is based on compromise in many respects and meets many demands.
- Pesticides are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds.
- They must be used in accordance with set rules.
- A shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices.
- PPE-DE will vote for the reports adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety if the amendments by her political group are adopted.
