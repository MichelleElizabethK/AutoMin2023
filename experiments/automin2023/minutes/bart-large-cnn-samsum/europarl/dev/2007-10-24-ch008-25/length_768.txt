ATTENDEES : PERSON157, PERSON159, PERSON160


SUMMARY
- PERSON157 wants Parliament to note that the Commission has forwarded a communication on loss relief, rather than "welcomes" it, as work on the report on that topic is in progress in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
- Mrs Wagenknecht wants to withdraw her name from the report and appeal to everyone in the House to vote against it.
