SUMMARY

- The text is available for the honourable Members in all languages.

- PERSON100 wants the President to act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
- The text of the Socialist resolution has been subject to a substantial amendment that should have been voted on by a show of hands and not by roll-call vote.
- The President is listening to all the arguments expressed so that he can act in the most appropriate manner.
- PERSON102 asks Mr President to vote on a joint resolution by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and the Groups of the Greens/EFA and the GUE/NGL Group.
- PERSON105 votes the wrong way because of the roll-call vote.
- PERSON108 wants the chairmen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to respond to what the President said.
- Mr President was elected by a large majority and has the right to lead every vote, whether he likes it or not.

- Two months remain of his mandate in this Parliament.
- Mr Poettering defends the honour of the President of the European Parliament.
- The President will consult the members of the Bureau on the technical issues relating to the three problems raised during the speeches.
- The Presidency will then announce its decision and the President will take the decision he considers appropriate.
- The Resolution presented by the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE groups is ready to be voted on in the version subject to the latest amendment.
- The Bureau accepted the last-minute amendments yesterday without subjecting them to any formal amendment procedure.
- Some Members voted the second time without being aware of precisely what was being voted on.
- The result of the second round is the same as the first.
