SUMMARY
- PERSON078 and Pervenche Berès are taking part in a debate on the management of the crisis on the financial markets.
- The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a great deal of work on the analysis of the European financial system and the implications of consolidation in financial services.
- The present system of financial supervision in the European Union is not capable of ensuring the proper supervision of large multinational financial groups.
- The European Union's financial system is characterised by diversity and by the wealth of operators operating across frontiers, on both sides of the Atlantic and on the global stage.
- The issue of European excellence in regulatory matters has a transatlantic dimension and it is time to move forward.
- Mrs Berès has raised a number of important issues in her speech.
- The European financial system plays a pivotal role in strengthening the financial-stability framework in the EU.
- The Council stressed the importance of fair and non-discriminatory national supervisory practices to achieve a level playing field within the EU and an adequate and independent financial supervision to ensure financial stability.
- The Financial Services Committee has been asked to monitor the progress achieved by the three level 3 committees in implementing the various tools.
- The FSC has also been instructed to monitor convergence of supervisory powers at an adequate level.
- Parliament and the Council agreed on the text of the Directive on the supervisory assessment of acquisitions in the financial sector as early as March.
- The European financial sector has changed dramatically over the last few years.
- The Commission has created European committees of supervisors in the areas of securities, banking and insurance.
- It has already led to greater supervisory cooperation and more convergence in supervisory practices.
- In investment services, there is the principle of more central control with some limited exceptions for branches.
- There will be a Commission conference on 26 June.

- The Commission will produce its own assessment of the way in which the Lamfoulussy process works towards the end of the year.
- Mrs Berès' question on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is being discussed and answered here today.
- The crisis simulation with a view to reviewing financial stability in the EU has revealed shortcomings.
- Consumer protection, an effective financial industry and stable financial markets constitute the supreme objective of financial supervision.
- Good supervision must be guided by the existing risks and take a principle-based approach instead of devoting itself to detailed individual analysis.
- Parliament has adopted a report on the supervision of European financial markets.
- The report questions whether the present system ensures the effective supervision of large groups that operate in various countries and sectors.
- Parliament agreed on the need for a committee of experts to study these implications and report back with their recommendations.
- The Financial Services Action Plan is now more or less complete.
- The focus is now on implementation and supervisory convergence.
- The development of financial supervision is of critical importance.
- A stable financial environment is a prerequisite for the economic growth that the EU needs, and the protection of consumers.
