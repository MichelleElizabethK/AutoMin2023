SUMMARY
- PERSON119 thanks Mr Costa for the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions and Regulation No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.
- The Commission will in future prefer the so-called 'omnibus approach' to reduce administrative burden.
- PERSON121: The basic Regulation dates back to 1960, when our countries were separate and there were different rules on hygiene and food.
- It is a good idea for us to divest ourselves of these rules and adapt them.
- The committee chairing the committee on Transport and Tourism, which he chairs, accepted his report unanimously.
- PERSON125 congratulates the Commission on the report that seeks to cut regulation for small businesses.
- The debate is closed and the vote will take place on Tuesday.
- PERSON126 thinks the amendments needed to be made and go in the right direction.
- PERSON127 wants to repeat what he said in committee tomorrow in the hope of achieving the same outcome.
