SUMMARY
- The next item is the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions.
- The report is by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
- The European Parliament has divided into two parts the so-called 'omnibus proposal' for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending both Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions and Regulation No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs.
- The simplified system being proposed by the Commission will significantly ease the administrative burden on some 300 000 European haulage companies.
- The basic Regulation dates back to 1960, when our countries were separate, and it was necessary to indicate which road to take and where to cross borders.
- Since much of this no longer serves any purpose it is a good idea for us to divest ourselves of these rules and adapt them.
- The committee chairing the report accepted it unanimously.
- The House will do the same tomorrow.
- Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions needed updating.
- The European Parliament intends to reduce by 25% the administrative burden on enterprises by the year 2012.
- The Committee on Transport and Tourism voted unanimously in favor of the proposal put forward by rapporteur Costa.
- PERSON125 congratulates the Commission on the report that seeks to cut regulation for small businesses.
- The debate is closed and the vote will take place on Tuesday.
- PERSON126 thinks the amendments needed to be made and go in the right direction.
- PERSON127 wants to repeat what he said in committee tomorrow in the hope of achieving the same outcome.
