ATTENDEES : PERSON118, PERSON120, PERSON123, PERSON124


SUMMARY
- PERSON118 informs his colleagues in the PPE-DE Group that there is a mistake in the second part of the split vote and the right decision is 'no', not 'yes'.
- PERSON120 will read out in English: 'Welcomes as a positive step towards reform of the criminal justice system in Uzbekistan the approval by the Parliament of the laws on the abolition of the death penalty and the authorisation of courts to issue arrest warrants' PERSON123 is bewildered because all of her yellow neighbours have disappeared.
