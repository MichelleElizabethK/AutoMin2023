SUMMARY
- The next item is the report on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
- Jacek Protasiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, will present it to the committee on the next item PERSON080.
- There have been several months of discussions in the European Parliament on the issue of modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
- The publication of the Green Paper has given rise to wide public debate throughout the European Union.
- Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation, arguing that this will increase employment and reduce unemployment.
- Others support a greater protective function for labour law.
- The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs.
- It proposed clauses giving a positive assessment of the influence of 'atypical' forms of employment on job creation in the European Union and challenged Member States to apply active employment policy methods and support adaptability.
- According to PERSON081, 490 amendments to the report on the reform of the labour market were put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg.
- Almost half of the amendments support the approach of creating new jobs.
- The Green Paper on improving labour law elicited a huge response from a broad range of interested parties.
- It contains useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by cross-border mobility and the expansion of international trade throughout the EU.
- Some of the problems emerged during the course of the public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions.
- Labour law and collective bargaining are intrinsically linked.
- There is a wide variety of opinion on how to move forward from the Green Paper on labour law reform.
- The report in principle advocates an examination of flexibility and security as mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality.
- The principles of non-discrimination, gender equality, flexible working time for the purposes of reconciling work and family life and opportunities to gain education and vocational training are the cornerstones of employment security.
- There is a fear that increased cross-border mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis.
- The European Parliament is giving a good account of itself.
- Sustainable development requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time.
- The relationship between flexibility and security is a two-way relationship.
- PERSON084 is pleased with the debate but not with the method.
- The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees.
- Both Parliament's report and the European Trade Union are critical of the Green Paper.
- If one party in social consultation levels criticism of this kind, then we owe it to them to give them a decent answer.
- The rapporteur Protasiewicz's report on the reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century is unbalanced.
- The text rests on a conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict.
- A clear expression of the balance would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers.
- PERSON087 thanks rapporteur Mr Protasiewicz for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report.
- The EU needs to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and create sustainable growth with more and better jobs.
- Labour law has a crucial role to play in this area.
- Security of employment promotes flexibility, employment and competitiveness.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commission's narrow focus on individual labour law.
- The text adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship.
- A more flexible contract responds to a need for flexibility in response to peaks in demand and to production supply needs.
- It must not be an inappropriate instrument for introducing forms of discrimination on costs and safeguards.
- The Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report discussed is a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world.
- Every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services, and to guaranteed health services.
- The Commission's Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping and will lead to Euroscepticism.
- According to PERSON091, Europe concerns itself too little with employment problems.
- Job insecurity is a major social tragedy.
- Europe considers employment to be the basis of democracy and social cohesion.
- Europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work: stable employment, for an unlimited period, protected by contracts and with the role of the trade unions.
- The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy.
- The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise.
- The rapporteur's first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and reduce the regulations meant to protect workers.
- The second draft has been toned down.
- PERSON093 wants to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and withdraw the UK from EU employment and social legislation.
- The debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m. PERSON094 wants to know if the Commission's proposal on modernising labour law is legally defensible.
