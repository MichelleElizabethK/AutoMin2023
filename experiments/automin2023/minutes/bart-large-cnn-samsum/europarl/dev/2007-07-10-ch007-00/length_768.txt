SUMMARY
- Jacek Protasiewicz's report on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century has been discussed in the European Parliament for several months.
- There were four main challenges: positive and negative consequences on European economies of globalisation, rapid development of the service sector, sea change in technology and demographic change.
- Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation, while others support a greater protective function for labour law.
- There are over 60 amendments to the report in its present form.
- Almost half of them support the approach of creating new jobs.
- The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs.
- The result of the negotiations was put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg.
- The Green Paper on improving labour law elicited a huge response from a broad range of interested parties.
- It contains useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by cross-border mobility and the expansion of international trade throughout the EU.
- Some of the problems emerged during the course of the public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions.
- Labour law and collective bargaining are intrinsically linked.
- There were sharp divisions during Parliament's negotiations on the report and in parallel negotiations at EU and national levels.
- The report in principle advocates an examination of flexibility and security as mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality.
- The principles of non-discrimination, gender equality, flexible working time for the purposes of reconciling work and family life and the opportunities to gain education and vocational training are the cornerstones of employment security.
- The European Parliament is giving a good account of itself.
- Sustainable development requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time.
- The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees.
- Both Parliament's report and the European Trade Union are critical of the Green Paper on Employment and Social Affairs.
- The rapporteur Protasiewicz's report on the reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century is unbalanced.
- The text rests on a conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict.
- A clear expression of the balance would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers.
- PERSON087 thanks rapporteur Mr Protasiewicz for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report.
- The EU needs to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and create sustainable growth with more and better jobs.
- Labour law has a crucial role to play in this area.
- Security of employment promotes flexibility, employment and competitiveness.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commission's narrow focus on individual labour law.
- The text adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship.
- It is necessary for these forms of contract to be finalised in order to protect the needs of companies.
- It must not be an inappropriate instrument for introducing discrimination on costs and safeguards.
- Every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services.
- There are European areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives.
- The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of time today.
- In the field of services, liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations.
- Everybody expects the Commission to support workers' rights.
- Instead, the Commission's Green Paper talks about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping.
- This has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism.
- According to PERSON091, job insecurity is a major social problem in Europe.
- Europe considers the right to work to be the basis of democracy and social cohesion.
- The text submitted to Parliament is a compromise and has ambiguous points, but important elements.
- People091 is not convinced by the concept of flexicurity, of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits.
- The rapporteur's first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which, in fact, cause unemployment.
- It is the policy of the British Conservative Party to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and withdraw the UK from EU employment and social legislation.
- The debate is now suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
