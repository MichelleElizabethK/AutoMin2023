SUMMARY
- Jacek Protasiewicz's report on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century has been discussed in the European Parliament for several months.
- There were four main challenges: positive and negative consequences on European economies of globalisation, rapid development of the service sector, sea change in technology and demographic change.
- Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation, while others support a greater protective function for labour law.
- PERSON081 proposes to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape.
- The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs.
- The heated debate and 490 amendments proposed to the original text were subjected to further discussion and negotiations with all political groups.
- The result of the negotiations was put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg.
- Almost half of the amendments to the report in its present form support the approach of creating new jobs.
- There were sharp divisions during Parliament's negotiations on the report on the Green Paper on employment policies.
- The report in principle advocates an examination of flexibility and security as mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality.
- The European Parliament is giving a good account of itself.
- PERSON084 is pleased with the debate but not with the method.
- The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees.
- The text of the report shows no signs of spirit and shows no evidence of reform capability.
- People on the lowest incomes will be the first victims if the proposal is adopted intact.
- PERSON087 thanks the rapporteur, Mr Protasiewicz, for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commission's narrow focus on individual labour law.
- The text adopted is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship that today exist.
- The Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report discussed is a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world.
- Every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services, and to guaranteed health services.
- The Commission's Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping and will lead to Euroscepticism.
- PERSON091 and PERSON092 are critical of the European Commission's proposed changes to the European Union's Employment Act.
- They argue that job insecurity is a major social problem in Europe.
- They also argue that the text submitted to Parliament is a compromise and should not be rejected.
- PERSON093 wants to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and withdraw the UK from EU employment and social legislation.
- The debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m. PERSON094 wants to know if the Commission's proposal on modernising labour law is legally defensible.
