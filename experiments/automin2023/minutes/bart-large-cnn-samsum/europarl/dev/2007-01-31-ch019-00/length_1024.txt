- The European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data.
- The Commission is not aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector.
- The fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, but it cannot undermine or limit customers' right to have their personal financial data protected.

- The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has put forward proposals.
- The European Central Bank, for its part, has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent.

- I have never, under any circumstances, either denied or concealed any information that I could have given to the committee and to Parliament.
- If Europe wants to be a leader on the world political stage, it must achieve a global balance between the right to pursue and investigate terrorists and the duty to protect fundamental rights, such as the privacy of personal data.
