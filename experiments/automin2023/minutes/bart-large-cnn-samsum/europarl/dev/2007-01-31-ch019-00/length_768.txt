SUMMARY
- The next item is the debate on the oral question by Pervenche Ber√®s and Jean-Marie Cavada to the Council on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0002/2007.
- Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the U.S. enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems.
- In May 2006, the European Court of Justice declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data.
- The interim agreement is due to expire on 3 July this year.
- The EU's negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency, which the Commission endorses, was discussed by COREPER today.
- The Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February.
- The German Presidency of the Council will be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data.
- The Council and the Commission are still investigating the SWIFT data exchange between the U.S. and EU authorities.
- The Commission is expected to make a statement on the matter soon.
- The Council cannot answer the question as to whether these matters will impact Regulation 1781 of 15 November 2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds.
- The temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year.
- The Vice-President of the Commission recommends that the Council authorises the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives.
- He hopes that by mid-February they will get a negotiating mandate.
- The right to privacy is non-negotiable.
- Legal certainty is also important for air-carriers.
- The negotiations will present a real challenge for Europe.
- PERSON117 wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT.
- Only seven Member States have so far replied to his request for clarification.
- In many cases, central banks had been informed by the US Treasury of the transfer of data from SWIFT Europe to SWIFT United States.
- The national data protection authorities are investigating the issue.
- The Automated Targeting System would not be used for processing SWIFT data as it is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
- The European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data.
- The Commission is not aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector.
- The fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, but it cannot undermine or limit customers' right to have their personal financial data protected.
- After September 11, relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition.
- Neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to attend the hearing.
- Central Bank bore very little responsibility for what had happened in the PNR case, but it is clear that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner SWIFT transferred information to US Treasury.
- The European Central Bank has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent.
- Parliament wants to discuss the transfer of data via SWIFT with the U.S. President-in-Office of the Council.
- SWIFT is a Belgian company, but it is in a legal vacuum as it is a European-level body.
- In a few months time, the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire.
- The previous agreement was annulled by the Court.
- The data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004, the 'push' system, is not yet operational.
- The Commission should have applied more pressure to ensure that the push system was implemented by airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors.
- PERSON120 and PERSON121 express their views on the PNR, SWIFT system and American authorities' access to data relating to financial transfers.
- They are concerned about the protection of European citizens' rights and the credibility of their partnership with the United States.
- The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire.
- There is a well-founded suspicion that access to the data held in the SWIFT System could represent an illegal intrusion into personal privacy.
- PERSON122 wants to ask the Commission, the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman if accessing the data in SWIFT represents a violation of the provisions on data protection.
- There is an urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of trans-Atlantic relations.
- Europe is in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement, but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens' privacy.
- The European Parliament must be fully involved in this process.
- The Belgian data protection authorities and the 'Article 29' Working Group believe SWIFT's transmission of personal and banking data to the US law enforcement authorities is a violation of the Belgian and European rules on data protection.
- The European Commission has held a dialogue with the American Treasury department with a view to finding a solution to the SWIFT data transfer issue.

- The SWIFT system has cut short some atrocious terrorist initiatives and helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005.
- However, when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law, it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards.

- Mrs in 't Veld is still in excellent form verbally.
