SUMMARY
- The next item is the debate on the oral question by Pervenche Ber√®s and Jean-Marie Cavada to the Council on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B6-0001/2007.
- The next item of the agenda is a debate on an oral question on the PNR and on the question on civil liberties and the economic affairs.
- After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the U.S. enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems.
- In May 2006, the European Court of Justice declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to US authorities.
- The interim agreement is due to expire on 3 July this year.
- The EU's negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency, which the Commission endorses, was discussed by COREPER today.
- The Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February.
- The German Presidency of the Council will be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data.
- The Council and the Commission are still investigating the SWIFT-U.S. exchange of information between SWIFT and the American authorities.
- No new group has been appointed with this purpose in mind.
- The Presidency is considering how the work on this at Council level might be organised.
- The Commission is considering submitting a proposal for the amendment of the Regulation.
- The Commission's function is to monitor the implementation of Community law in the Member States and take appropriate action when a Member State fails to discharge its obligations under EC law.
- The Council believes that good work is being done within the international framework for combating terrorism.
- The working party on money laundering and the funding of terrorism's recommendations are addressed to banks and financial institutions.
- The temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year.
- The Commission recommends that the Council authorises the Presidency to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives.
- PERSON117 hopes that by mid-February they will get a negotiating mandate to open the negotiations.
- The negotiations for a new agreement with the United States on PNR data are a key priority for the Commission and for PERSON117 personally.
- PERSON117 is in favour of finding a European solution to the SWIFT issue.
- He would like to see the Parliament and the US Congress make a joint political commitment for the negotiations.
- PERSON117 is concerned with legal protection for personal data transferred and legal certainty for all parties concerned.
- The purpose of the transfers must be restricted solely to terrorism investigations and preventing the funding of terrorism.
- There should be no non-specific transfers of data without suspects who warrant further investigation first being identified.
- Only seven Member States have so far replied to PERSON117's request for clarification.
- Banks normally use personal data for the sole purpose of executing payment orders.
- They were not informed that personal data are transferred to the US Treasury by SWIFT.
- In many cases, central banks had been informed by US Treasury of the transfer.
- The Automated Targeting System would not be used for processing SWIFT data as it is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
- The European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data.
- The Commission is not aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector.
- The fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, but it cannot undermine or limit customers' right to have their personal financial data protected.
- After September 11, relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition.
- The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has begun to put forward proposals.
- This is the first time there has been a specific debate on SWIFT in the Chamber.
- The Central Bank has sent a letter to Mr Cavada and me.
- It confirms what they had said at the hearing.
- The memorandum between SWIFT and the US Treasury in April 2004 shows that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner in which SWIFT transferred information to US Treasury.
- The 1995 Directive had not been complied with.
- The European Central Bank has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent.
- Parliament wants to discuss the transfer of data via SWIFT with the U.S. President-in-Office of the Council.
- SWIFT is a Belgian company, but it is in a legal vacuum as it is a European-level body.
- In a few months time, the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire.
- The previous agreement was annulled by the Court.
- The data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004, the 'push' system, is not yet operational.
- The Commission should have applied more pressure to ensure that the push system was implemented by airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors.
- PERSON120 and PERSON121 express their views on the PNR, SWIFT system and American authorities' access to data relating to financial transfers.
- They are concerned about the protection of European citizens' rights and the credibility of their partnership with the United States.
- The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire.
- There is a well-founded suspicion that access to the data held in the SWIFT System could represent an illegal intrusion into personal privacy.
- PERSON122 wants to ask the Commission, the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman if accessing the data in SWIFT represents a violation of the provisions on data protection.
- There is an urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of trans-Atlantic relations.
- Europe is in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement, but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens' privacy.

- PERSON124 wants the President to consult Parliament on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT.
- She also wants to know if the Commission and Council are aware of other categories of data being accessed by the US authorities, including passenger data, SWIFT data, telecommunications records and social security records.
- PERSON124 wants to know about the switch from push to pull, which was scheduled for December 2005, then for December 2006, and now January 2007.
- She would also like reassurances about profiling and data-mining, and about storage periods and about purpose limitation.
- The SWIFT system has cut short some atrocious terrorist initiatives and helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005.
- However, when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law, it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards.
- The European Central Bank played a leading role in this instrument.
- Mrs in 't Veld is still in excellent form verbally.
- MEPs want to know what data are being collected of their citizens in all kinds of areas.

- This is good for civil liberties.
- The recent elections in the USA give the European Union the chance to negotiate a new PNR agreement.
- The EU should insist on protection of personal data and ban the use of data for purposes unrelated to the fight against terrorism.
- It should also ban direct access to airline company files.
- SWIFT transferred European citizens' data to Washington without the knowledge of the European Parliament, the national parliaments or the individuals concerned.

- PERSON132 and PERSON133 are critical of the way SWIFT was treated.
- They also question the absence of the Americans from the hearing.
- They support the European Parliament's involvement in monitoring the routine transfer of European Union citizens' personal data to the United States.
- The future agreement must be based on the push system.
- The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used.
- The future agreement should be given full democratic legitimacy.
- The rules governing personal data need urgently to be protected under the third pillar.

- Europe must remain the defender of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.
- Europe needs a framework decision on data protection.
- The EU needs to negotiate and get an agreement on information exchange between the EU and the US in order to safeguard the respect of the European regulatory framework.
- The ECB is subject to the data privacy requirements of EU law, but it does not seem to take any responsibility for what it might have in this information exchange.
- The Council is negotiating with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data.
- It would be unacceptable to them as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens and non-Americans.
- Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner and the European Commission are negotiating a transatlantic partnership.
- They are standing with their back to the wall and with a pistol pointed at their chest.
- Credibility is undermined by their hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved.
- European citizens are aware that, when they board an aircraft, 34 items of data are transferred.
- There is a clear dividing line between the European and American positions on the SWIFT issue.
