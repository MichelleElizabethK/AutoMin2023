SUMMARY
- The report on the Horn of Africa: EU Regional political partnership for peace, security and development is the European Parliament's response to the European Commission's communiqué of last November.
- It is based on the assumption that without lasting peace there can be no development and without development there can't be lasting peace.
- The strategy proposed by the Commission aims to tackle the underlying causes of the instability in the region and bring closer regional cooperation.
- Regional integration must focus on issues such as water resources, desertification, food security, and not simply on ethnic divisions and conflicts.
- European Union has a key role to play by importing its own tried-and-tested model of integration.
- The aim of the report is to flesh out the ideas of the Commission's communiqué and to develop a regional strategy for the region.
- Mr Kaczmarek's report confirms most of the priorities proposed by the Commission, especially with regard to functional cooperation and regional cooperation.
- The current situation in the Horn of Africa demands far more vigorous and unanimous action from the entire international community.
- The aim is to tackle from the root the problems that affect the countries in the region by addressing common development problems that have an impact on security and stability.
- The Commission organised a conference on 23 April with Heads of State or Government in the Horn of Africa.
- The report that you will adopt tomorrow will be a source of inspiration and direction for conducting the dialogue that will take place over the next few months.
- The strategy for the Horn proposed by the Commission is not intended to supplant the strategies prepared in the context of the 10th European Development Fund.
- It is there, in a way, to supplement them.
- In the Horn of Africa, there is a lethal cocktail of conflict and poverty, where rule of law barely exists and there is no concept of democracy and human rights.
- Five out of seven of the countries of the region are in conflict with their neighbours.
- In Darfur, the UN says that 200 000 people have died and two million have been displaced since the conflict began in 2003.
- The border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia remain unresolved.
- There is intense fighting in Somalia, where about a thousand people died and where Ethiopian troops have been active.
- The Eritreans, meanwhile, back Islamist militias.
- The EU supports the transitional government in Somalia.
- The EU provides 55% of the world's development cooperation humanitarian aid to the Horn of Africa.
- The African Strategy and Articles 8 and 11 of the Kotonu Agreement are not working.
- The Somali peninsula is one of the least developed regions in the world.
- The most important thing for the European Union is to build institutions that would guarantee an end to armed conflict in the Somali peninsula.
- The European Commission is committed to the Horn of Africa.
- The Commission made available EUR 15 million to the Ugandan stabilisation force in Somalia without conditions attached.
- President Youssouf promised to organise a national congress of reconciliation in Somalia, but he hasn't done it yet.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
- The first point of view tends to be held by the European Union and the second by the United States.
- The European Union has to coordinate its actions with the other major decision-makers, but it also needs to take up its own position on matters such as Somalia.
