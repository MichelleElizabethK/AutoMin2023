SUMMARY
- The report on the Horn of Africa: EU Regional political partnership for peace, security and development is the European Parliament's response to the European Commission's communiqu√© of last November.

- The strategy proposed by the Commission aims to tackle the underlying causes of the instability in the horn of Africa and to bring about closer regional cooperation.
- Mr Kaczmarek's report confirms most of the priorities proposed by the Commission, especially with regard to functional cooperation and regional cooperation.

- The EU provides 55% of the world's development cooperation humanitarian aid.
- PERSON195 congratulates Mr Kaczmarek on preparing the report on the Somali peninsula.
- The most important thing for the European Union at the present time is to build institutions that would guarantee an end to armed conflict in the peninsula, protect a minimum of human rights and lead to governments based on rule of law.
- PERSON196 is more cautious about the involvement of the Commission and of the EU in the Horn of Africa.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
- The first point of view tends to be held by the European Union and the second by the United States.
