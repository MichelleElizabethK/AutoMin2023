SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Filip Kaczmarek, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the Horn of Africa: EU Regional political partnership for peace, security and development.
- It is titled "The EU Regional Political Partnership for Peace, Security and Development".
- The report on the strategy of the European Union in Africa and the EU political partnership in the Horn of Africa will be the European Parliament's response to the European Commission's communiqué of last November.
- The aim is to create a regional political partnership as the basis for a comprehensive approach to preventing conflict in the region.
- Regional integration must focus on issues such as water resources, desertification, food security, and not simply on ethnic divisions and conflicts.
- European Union has a key role to play by importing its own tried-and-tested model of integration.
- The aim of the report is to flesh out the ideas of the Commission's communiqué and to develop a regional strategy for the region.
- Mr Kaczmarek's report confirms most of the priorities proposed by the Commission, especially with regard to functional cooperation and regional cooperation.
- The current situation in the Horn of Africa demands far more vigorous and unanimous action from the entire international community.
- The aim is to tackle from the root the problems that affect the countries in the region by addressing common development problems that have an impact on security and stability.
- The Commission organised a conference on 23 April with Heads of State or Government in the Horn of Africa.
- The report that you will adopt tomorrow will be a source of inspiration and direction for conducting the dialogue that will take place over the next few months.
- The strategy for the Horn proposed by the Commission is not intended to supplant the strategies prepared in the context of the 10th European Development Fund.
- It is there, in a way, to supplement them.
- In the Horn of Africa, there is a lethal cocktail of conflict and poverty, where the rule of law barely exists and there is no concept of democracy and human rights.
- Five out of seven of the countries of the region are in conflict with their neighbours.
- In Darfur, the UN says that some 200 000 people have died and two million have been displaced since the conflict began in 2003.
- The border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia remain unresolved.
- Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders refuse to give the people the right to choose their own government and respect elections.
- There is intense fighting in Somalia, where about a thousand people have died.
- Ethiopian troops have been fighting on behalf of the transitional government in Somalia with covert assistance from the U.S.
- The Eritreans, meanwhile, back the Islamist militias.
- The EU has offered support to the Somali transitional government.
- The Commissioner should be held accountable for his actions.
- Neither the African Strategy nor Articles 8 and 11 of the Kotonu Agreement are working in the Horn of Africa.
- The EU provides 55% of the world's development cooperation humanitarian aid.
- China, India and the USA must create a special crisis management model for the Horn.
- The Somali peninsula is one of the least developed regions in the whole world.
- The most important thing for the European Union is to build institutions that would guarantee an end to armed conflict in the peninsula, protect a minimum of human rights and lead to governments based on rule of law.
- The European Union should also help African countries to establish regional institutions of cooperation.
- The European Commission is wholly committed to the Horn of Africa, which is the region of which PERSON196 spends most time.
- PERSON196 is concerned about Ethiopia's political prisoners.
- He is working on bilateral relations with Ethiopia's prime minister on this matter almost daily basis.
- PERSON196 made available EUR 15 million to the Ugandan stabilisation force in Somalia without conditions attached.
- President Youssouf promised to organise a national congress of reconciliation, but they are still waiting for it.
- Somalia is not considered in the context of the Horn of Africa as a whole.
- There are two points of view in the international community: one held by the European Union and the other by the United States.
- European Union is not in a position to act in a truly autonomous manner.
- EU should be able to have greater strategic autonomy and more independence.
- PERSON196 has been working on political dialogue in the Horn of Africa for the past few months.
- He believes that the European Union is not entitled to refrain from taking the initiative in this matter.
- He has also sent a letter to President Youssouf in order to remind him of his commitment to inclusivity in resolving this conflict.
