SUMMARY
- The vote adapts the procedures to take full advantage of the new powers of the European Parliament.
- The interinstitutional agreement negotiated by Mr Daul and myself secured new powers earlier this year.
- This is the most important increase in the powers since the Treaty of Nice and probably the only significant increase during this legislature.
