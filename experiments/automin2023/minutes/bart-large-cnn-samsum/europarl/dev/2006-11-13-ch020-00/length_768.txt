SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0237/2006.
- PERSON162 is a member of the Commission.
- He is concerned about certain aspects of the Council agreement on direct payments and market-related expenditure.
- He agrees that the exemption of EUR 320 million for Portugal from the requirement of national cofinancing should be an exception in rural development.
- The Commission proposed to shift 20% of agricultural direct payments from the first pillar of CAP to the second, so that they could be spent without mandatory co-funding.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected the proposal with only three dissenting votes.
- Parliament will play a full part in the review of the Community budget post-2013.
- There will be a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The Council has offered no response to the legitimate concerns of Europe's farmers.
- The renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds.
- Parliament should have a decisive role in the debate.
- Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development gave unanimous approval to the additional aid for rural development in Portugal.
- The committee made it clear that Parliament has suspended its verdict with regard to voluntary modulation.
- The Commission has only followed the Council's 'orders', for want of a better word.
- Parliament has approved the financial perspectives, which contain precise figures.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets reject the Commission's proposal to increase non-mandatory expenditure on rural development by billions of euros.
- The Commissioner should have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted.
- There is no provision for cofinancing on the part of the Member States.
- The average earnings of farmers in the constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10,000 or EUR 14,000.
- Prime Minister Blair proposes to slash 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of the existing 5% compulsory modulation.
- British farmers will lose roughly 33% of their subsidy, which for many is a vital lifeline.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the legislative text of the Commission regulation on voluntary modulation.
- They agree in principle with the Commission proposals for defining the measure on a multiannual basis at national level and retaining the limits which exist in the Rural Development Fund, but they do not consider them adequate.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- The Commission did not go along with this proposal.
- Voluntary modulation would mean moving funds from the EU budget's compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure, so the Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement.
- Mr Mulder objects to the proposal to take 20% out of the first pillar and use it to top up what they have taken away from the second pillar.
- The Commission and the House are responsible for rural development falling EUR 20 billion short of the budget proposal made by this House and the Commission.
- Mr Mulder wants to know what the Commissioner proposes to do about it.
- PERSON170 supports the Commission's proposal to exempt Portugal from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million, in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement.
- PERSON171 congratulates Mr Goepel on his excellent report and supports compulsory modulation of direct payments for farmers.
- PERSON172 supports the proposal and rejects it.
- The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States.
- Portugal returns more second-pillar funding to Brussels than any other country.
- The Minister for Agriculture in Portugal has already announced the intention to adopt 20% modulation.
- Taking back money from farmers in order to fund the State budget would not be the best solution for farmers.
- PERSON174 supports Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
- The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers' incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States.
- R rapporteur criticises the method by which rural development funds are distributed under the current rules.
- The proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers.
- Polish MEPs warned of the consequences of approving an EU budget of just 1% of GNP and cutting rural development funds.
- PERSON178 congratulates Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports.
- He rejects the proposal to hijack a maximum of 20% or even 25% of farmers' single farm payments.
- It will erode the concept of the family farm, which is the backbone of Northern Ireland's industry.
- The proposal will be referred back to committee.
- PERSON179 voted against the agreement on the new financial perspective for the rural development package.
- The proposal for voluntary additional modulation does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy.
- PERSON180 is calling on the Commission to propose an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States.
- UK rural development funding has been restricted in recent years.
- PERSON181 wants to focus more closely on Mr Mulder's report on the mechanism of funding designated for areas inhabited by some 20% of the population of the European Union.
- The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Regional Development should also serve this purpose.
- The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas.
- The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of Council decisions aimed at offsetting the difficulties faced by Portuguese farmers in relation to the CAP.
- The Goepel report is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it.
- The Commissioner is not alone in defending this position in Parliament.
- The European Parliament will vote tomorrow on a proposal to change the Single Farm Payment Scheme and give the government more rural development money to squander.
- There is no support for the proposal from the Labour Party on the Socialist benches.
- The cotton regime was scrapped after a ruling by the European Court of Justice.
- PERSON185 questions the use of the current Community payments.
- Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement.
- The proposal to finance direct payments in the first pillar is a bad proposal and will be rejected by the European Parliament.
- The Commission is trying to get rules applied and is insisting that they be implemented.
- The proposal to cut 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development is unacceptable.
- It also represents renationalisation of the common agricultural policy and regionalising.
- The Commission's proposal is consistent with the European Council's request.
- The vote on the proposal will be tomorrow.
