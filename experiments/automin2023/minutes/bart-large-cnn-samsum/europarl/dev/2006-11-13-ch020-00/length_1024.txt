SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report by Jan Mulder on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development regarding a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0237/2006.
- Lutz Goepel's report is on the submission relating to the Regulation of the Council establishing the principles for the voluntary modulation of direct payments set out in Regulation No 1782/2003.
- The Committee on Agriculture rejects the proposal concerning voluntary modulation and calls on the Commission to withdraw the proposal.
- The Commission proposed to shift 20% of agricultural direct payments from the first pillar of CAP to the second, so that they could be spent without mandatory co-funding.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected the proposal with only three dissenting votes.
- Parliament will play a full part in the review of the Community budget post-2013.
- There will be a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The Council has offered no response to the legitimate concerns of Europe's farmers.
- The renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds.
- Parliament should have a decisive role in the debate.
- Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favor of additional aid for rural development in Portugal as part of a package of measures passed by the Council in December.
- The Committee on Budgets voted against the Commission's proposal on voluntary modulation.
- The Commissioner has not carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted.
- The average earnings of farmers in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10,000, or EUR 14,000.
- The Commission proposes to slash 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of the existing 5% compulsory modulation.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the proposal.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- The Commission did not go along with this proposal.
- Voluntary modulation would mean moving funds from the EU budget's compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure, so the Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement.
- PERSON169 wants Commissioner Mulder to reconsider his proposal to take 20% out of the first pillar and use it to top up what they have taken away from the second pillar.
- PERSON170 also wants Portugal to be exempt from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million.
- PERSON171 congratulates Mr Goepel on his excellent report.
- The proposed modulation of direct payments is a cause for concern among farmers in the new Member States.
- They fear a partial re-nationalisation of agricultural policy, which the new, poorer Member States will not be able to afford.
- The old members think of the future of agriculture in their own countries, rather than in the enlarged European Union.
- Rejecting the Commission's proposal is the most appropriate course of action.
- PERSON174 supports Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
- The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers' incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States.
- The proposal for so-called voluntary modulation of direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers.
- PERSON177 congratulates Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports.
- PERSON178 rejects the proposal to reduce direct payments for farmers by one third from 2008.
- The proposal will only be implemented in the United Kingdom.
- It will erode the concept of the family farm, which is the backbone of Polish industry.
- PERSON179 voted against the agreement on the new financial perspective of the 2003 CAP reform.
- The rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal.
- The proposal for voluntary additional modulation does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy.
- UK rural development funding has restricted its availability in the UK.
- PERSON182 wants to maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%.
- The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas.
- The new financial perspective adopted for 2007-2013 cut the rural development funds by 20 billion euro compared to what was proposed by the Commission.
- The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one.
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on a proposal to change the Single Farm Payment Scheme.
- The British Government is about to be fined for not meeting the deadline for the payment.
- The cotton regime was scrapped after a ruling by the European Court of Justice.
- The use of the current Community payments raises questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
- PERSON186, PERSON187 and PERSON189 are critical of the proposal to cut 20% of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development.
- PERSON188's travel arrangements got in the way and he couldn't attend the debate.
- The proposal will be rejected by the European Parliament.
