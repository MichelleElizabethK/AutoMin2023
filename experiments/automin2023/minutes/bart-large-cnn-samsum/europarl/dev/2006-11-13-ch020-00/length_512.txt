SUMMARY
- The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0237/2006.
- PERSON162 is a member of the Commission.
- He has concerns about certain aspects of the Council agreement on direct payments and market-related expenditure.
- Both the single farm payment and rural development expenditure are considered as non-trade distorting under the WTO rules.
- He does not share the argument that voluntary modulation would distort competition.
- There is no proper impact assessment of the proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.
- The text reflects the non-cofinancing requirement for an amount of EUR 320 million as part of the Rural Development Fund allocation to Portugal, which was agreed at last December's Council meeting.
- I agree that the exemption for Portugal from the requirement of national cofinancing is an exception in rural development.
- The Commission proposed to shift 20% of agricultural direct payments from the first pillar of CAP to the second, so that they could be spent without mandatory co-funding.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected the proposal with only three votes.
- The House has already expressed strong misgivings about this proposal.
- As part of the Budget compromise, all institutions agreed that all the Community's outgoings should be subject to review.
- Now, the Council wants to remodel the agricultural funding without any prior consultation with Parliament.
- The proposal is questionable in terms of financial policy and there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal.
- There will be a reduction in payments of one-third over against what they were in 2003.
- The Council has offered no response whatever to the legitimate concerns of Europe's farmers.
- The renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds.
- The next Council meeting is on 14 November.
- The BÃ¶ge report on rural areas' financial problems has been rejected by the Council.
- The proposal is wide of the mark legally, in terms of its substance and as policy, and solves none of the problems that rural areas have.
- The Council should reject it if it wants to take part in future debates on the valuation of the agricultural budget.
- Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development gave unanimous approval to the additional aid for rural development in Portugal.
- It was part of a package of measures passed by the Council in December.
- The committee made it clear that Parliament has suspended its verdict with regard to voluntary modulation.
- It is surprising that the Commission should come up with a proposal so promptly.
- The European Parliament has the right to enact the Budget.
- If voluntary modulation were to be implemented, it would have an impact on the financial perspectives.
- I am not certain Parliament will go along with this.
- I will be voting against the Commission's proposals on voluntary modulation.
- The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets reject the Commission's proposal to increase non-mandatory expenditure on rural development by billions of euros.
- The Commissioner should have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted.
- There is no provision for cofinancing on the part of the Member States.
- The average earnings of farmers in the constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10,000 or EUR 14,000.
- Prime Minister Blair proposes to slash 20% off farmers' single-farm payments, on top of the existing 5% compulsory modulation.
- British farmers will lose roughly 33% of their subsidy, which for many is a vital lifeline.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote against the legislative text of the Commission regulation on voluntary modulation.
- They agree in principle with the Commission proposals for defining the measure on a multiannual basis at national level and retaining the limits which exist in the Rural Development Fund, but they do not consider them adequate.
- The European Council decided that a Member State may cut a farmer's direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20%.
- The Commission did not go along with this proposal.
- Voluntary modulation would mean moving funds from the EU budget's compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure, so the Council would be in violation of the interinsitutional agreement.
- Mr Mulder objects to the proposal to take 20% out of the first pillar and use it to top up what they have taken away from the second pillar.
- The proposal is not easy to justify on the basis of the money involved, but the offer being made to us is improper.
- PERSON169 and PERSON170 want the Commissioner to reconsider his proposal to limit the co-funding of the second pillar to 20%.
- They want Portugal to be exempt from the requirement to co-finance the amount of EUR 320 million in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement.
- PERSON171 congratulates Mr Goepel on his excellent report.
- The proposed modulation of agricultural policy affects the old Member States and concerns farmers in the new Member States.
- They fear that it will lead to a partial re-nationalisation of the agricultural policy, which the new, poorer Member States will not be able to afford.
- Today's debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments highlights the different ways in which the old and the new Member States understand the common agricultural policy.
- Rejecting the Commission's proposal is the most appropriate course of action.
- The poorer states, who receive much lower payments, are forced to compete on unequal terms.
- New Member States paid as much as 75% to the first pillar in 2004, while the old members benefit from 100% EU support.
- The Council's decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States.
- Portugal returns more second-pillar funding to Brussels than any other country.
- The Minister for Agriculture in Portugal has already announced the intention to adopt 20% modulation.
- Taking back money from farmers in order to fund the State budget would not be the best solution for farmers.
- PERSON174 supports Mr Mulder's draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million.
- The rapporteur criticises the method by which rural development funds are distributed under the current rules.
- The new Member States are characterised by significant under-investment in the farming sector and their farmers' incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States.
- Permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds takes the floor in the debate on the modification of the ceilings on EAFRD development support.
- He regrets the fact that the European Parliament is being forced to change the ceilings that it has already adopted.
- He also regrets that there is no real strategy for Christmas gifts to Portugal.
- The proposal for so-called 'voluntary modulation' by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20% in the funds paid out to farmers.
- Polish MEPs warned of the consequences of approving an EU budget of just 1% of GNP and cutting rural development funds.
- PERSON178 congratulates Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports.
- He rejects the proposal to hijack a maximum of 20% or even 25% of farmers' single farm payments.
- It will erode the concept of the family farm, which is the backbone of Northern Ireland's industry.
- The proposal will be referred back to committee.
- According to the 2003 CAP reform, the rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal.
- The proposal for voluntary additional modulation does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy.
- The risk of distorted competition is too great if certain Member States choose to deduct 20% from direct aid and not from other types of aid.
- PERSON180 speaks on behalf of the UK delegation in his group.
- He calls on the Commission to find a way of redressing the imbalances in the allocation of rural development funding for 2007 to 2013 in the UK.
- He asks that the Commission and colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture take account of the fact that the levels are of concern not only to Member States but to administrations at sub-state level.
- According to Mr. President, we must maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States and not introduce the additional modulation of 20%.
- The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas.
- Rural areas in European Union countries, including Poland, are poorer than the cities and need more jobs, development of services and better environmental protection.
- The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of Council decisions aimed at offsetting the difficulties faced by Portuguese farmers in relation to the CAP.
- The Goepel report is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it.
- The Commissioner is not alone in defending this position in Parliament.
- The European Parliament will vote tomorrow on a proposal to change the Single Farm Payment Scheme and give the government more rural development money to squander.
- There is no support for the proposal from the Labour Party on the Socialist benches.
- The cotton regime was scrapped after a ruling by the European Court of Justice.
- Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement, which raises questions about the budgetary decision-making process.
- In future, no Member State should be allowed to benefit from special treatment solely in order to persuade it to support a particular agreement.
- Equality and transparency are fundamental criteria that should be observed in all circumstances.
- PERSON186 is critical of the proposal to change the rules on rural development.
- The proposal is a bad idea and will be rejected.
- The Commission is trying to get rules applied and is insisting that they be implemented, but it is excluding market support measures.
- It is difficult to make something good out of a poor suggestion.
- The proposal to cut 20% of direct aid to farmers is unacceptable.
- It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy.
- The proposal by the Spanish Government to the Council goes further and includes renationalising and regionalising.
- It is part of the disintegratory madness of the socialist Spanish President.
- The presidents who signed the financial perspectives and accept this change do not care about competitiveness of the European agricultural sector.
- PERSON188 didn't come to the debate as his travel arrangements went awry.
- The vote on the proposal to change the rural development policy will be tomorrow.
- If the European Parliament rejects it, the Commissioner will raise the issue with his fellow Commissioners to consider their position carefully.
