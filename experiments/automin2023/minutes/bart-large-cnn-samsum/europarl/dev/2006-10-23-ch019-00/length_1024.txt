SUMMARY
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on two measures proposed by the Commission.
- They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive.
- Parliament has made several proposals to the Commission for improving the text.
- The Commission is ready to accept most of them.
- PERSON148 asks the President to stick to the January 2008 deadline to define what equivalence will be, so as to make the ultimate time limit of 1 January 2009 a strict time limit.
- The Parliament has helped to strengthen the methodology and scrutinise the approach involved in the transatlantic negotiations.
- The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a draft report on the implementing provisions of the transparency directive.
- The committee succeeded in getting the Commission to accept some of its core demands.
- However, there are still areas where the Commission has not done as Parliament would wish.
- PERSON150 appeals to the Members of this House to vote 'yes' tomorrow.
- The number of globally-active enterprises is on the increase.
- The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone in the creation of an integrated single financial market and in the harmonisation of accountancy in Europe.
- Developed economies with a high degree of share capitalisation and high stock exchange turnovers achieve more growth and create more jobs.
- The European Commission should look for ways to harmonise the standards.
- PERSON154 points out that the new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area, but it will be applicable to new amendments in the future.
- The Board of Trustees signals to the effect that a critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether convergence is achievable.
- The main question has to do with how, in future, we are to devise further standards for SMEs.
- PERSON156 thanks her colleagues for their work on the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives.
- She was the rapporteur for the MiFID procedure.
- The European Parliament needs to have confidence in comitology, especially after the July decision.
- The equivalence decision is right to postpone it.
- The Commission will monitor the implementation of the transparency directive.
- The debate is closed and the vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
- The motion for resolution has not been passed.
- The vote will be held according to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, as stated by PERSON158.
