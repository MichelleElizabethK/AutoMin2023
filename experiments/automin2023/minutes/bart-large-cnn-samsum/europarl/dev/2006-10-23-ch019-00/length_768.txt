SUMMARY
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on two measures proposed by the Commission.
- They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive.
- Parliament has made several proposals to the Commission for improving the text.
- The Commission is ready to accept most of them.
- The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are essentially a European project incorporating a principles-based system of accounting.
- Until now European companies had to adapt to US general accounting principles while they accepted US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Europe.
- With IFRS, European accounts will be accepted without adjustment in the US and other consenting third countries.
- Parliament and the Commission have two years to get the transatlantic capital market between the US and Europe right.
- Parliament has helped to strengthen the methodology and scrutinise the approach involved in this particular battle.
- Parliament wants to ensure that investors are protected and the right information is communicated to them in a relevant and timely manner.
- Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a draft report on the basis of which the plenary will adopt a resolution of its own tomorrow.
- The committee has succeeded in getting the Commission to accept some of its core demands.
- Parliament's success on this front has been limited, however, as the Commission hasn't done as Parliament would wish.
- Professor Lauk had an operation on his shoulder.
- Professor Lauk is the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
- The committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the draft resolution unanimously.
- The number of globally-active enterprises is on the increase.
- The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone.
- The European Parliament is discussing international financial accounting standards.
- Developed and developed countries are competing with each other for the same standards.
- The European Commission should look for ways to harmonise the standards or encourage harmonisation of the standards at the level of appropriate bodies.
- It is out of the question for the European Parliament to make decisions without consulting Parliament and players in financial markets.
- PERSON154 points out that the new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area, but it will be applicable to new amendments in the future.
- The Board of Trustees signals to the effect that a critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether convergence is achievable.
- The main question has to do with how, in future, we are to devise further standards for SMEs.
- PERSON156 thanks his colleagues for their work on the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives.
- He was the rapporteur for the MiFID procedure.
- The European Parliament needs to have confidence in comitology, especially after the July decision.
- The Commission and the European Parliament should march together on the single market issues.
- PERSON157: It's right to postpone the IFRS equivalence decision to promote the use of IFRS.
- Mr Skinner's point on the transparency directive is not the subject of today's debate.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
