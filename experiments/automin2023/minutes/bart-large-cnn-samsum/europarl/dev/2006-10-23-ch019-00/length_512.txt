SUMMARY
- Parliament will vote tomorrow on two measures proposed by the Commission.
- They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive.
- The rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have worked very constructively with the Commission and all parties concerned.
- The draft measures are balanced and efficient.
- Before 1 January 2008, Parliament will have decided on both a definition of equivalence and the equivalence mechanism.
- Exemption for issuers of professional securities from the need to provide narrative description of differences between third country GAAPs and IFRS remains an issue of concern.
- Transparency Directive is a step towards integrated European financial markets that investors and the public can trust.
- Parliament has made several proposals to the Commission for improving this text.
- The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are essentially a European project incorporating a principles-based system of accounting.
- Until now European companies had to adapt to US general accounting principles while they accepted US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Europe.
- With IFRS, European accounts will be accepted without adjustment in the US and other consenting third countries.
- PERSON149 welcomes the Commissioner and thanks him for his words about the report.
- He believes the close working relationship between Parliament, its various groups and the Commission has helped to steady the rudder on this one.
- The Commissioner is right to point this out not only to the USA but also to other third countries.
- He is positive that Parliament has put forward the right legislation.
- Personnel149 wants to know what the Commissioner will do about the voluntary initiatives to help companies report what they pay governments around the world in the extractive industries.
- He also wants to hear again what his predecessor gave as a promise some years ago to support that initiative.
- Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a draft report on the basis of which the plenary will adopt a resolution of its own tomorrow.
- The committee has succeeded in getting the Commission to accept some of its core demands.
- Parliament's success on this front has been limited, however, as the Commission hasn't done as Parliament would wish.
- Professor Lauk had an operation on his shoulder.
- Professor Lauk is the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
- He is standing in for him in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
- The committee adopted the draft resolution unanimously.
- Commissioner McCreevy has incorporated the essential points in his draft of the implementing Directive and made further modifications.
- The number of globally-active enterprises is on the increase.
- The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone in the creation of an integrated single financial market and in the harmonisation of accountancy in Europe.
- SEC should recognise year-end accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS by January 2009 at the latest.
- The European Parliament is discussing international financial accounting standards.
- Developed and developed countries are competing with each other for the same standards.
- The European Commission should look for ways to harmonise the standards or encourage harmonisation of the standards at the level of appropriate bodies.
- It is out of the question for the European Parliament to make decisions without consulting Parliament and players in financial markets.
- The new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area, but it will be applicable to new amendments in the future.
- The Board of Trustees signals to the effect that a critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether convergence is achievable.
- The main question has to do with how, in future, we are to devise further IFRS standards for SMEs.
- The wheels are turning and discussions are in progress in the relevant bodies.
- The rapporteur urges the Commission to monitor the process rigorously.
- The Parliament is in a position to review the way IFRS have been implemented.
- The greatest caution must be exercised in relation to this matter.
- The Parliament ensured that there was genuine equivalence during the equivalence negotiations.
- The issue is all about negotiation.
- Mr McCreevy has succeeded in getting the Americans to commit themselves to reconciliation at the end of the time period.
- PERSON156 thanks his colleagues for their work on the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives.
- He was the rapporteur for the MiFID procedure.
- The European Parliament needs to have confidence in comitology, especially after the July decision.
- The Commission and the European Parliament should march together on the single market issues.
- It is right to postpone the equivalence decision on IFRS.
- It gives us leverage in our efforts to obtain the removal of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad.
- It ensures that EU markets remain attractive to foreign issuers.
- It will benefit EU investors and issuers alike.
- A clear roadmap has been set out.
- If there is goodwill on all sides we will reach a satisfactory end.
- PERSON157: Worldwide more people are moving to the IFRS accounting standards adopted as from last year.
- PERSON158: On the transparency directive, I will deal with the point raised by Mr Skinner.
- The debate is closed.
- The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
