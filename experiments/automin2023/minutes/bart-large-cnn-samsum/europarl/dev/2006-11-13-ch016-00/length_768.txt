SUMMARY
- José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil reports on the 2006 annual report on the euro area (2006/2239).
- It is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on economic situation in the euro zone.
- The report is divided into several sections: macroeconomic policy, reforms, with special emphasis on the internal market, and institutional issues.
- PERSON065 wants to improve the way the European Economic Union operates.
- He wants a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament quarterly and a roadmap showing which way the euro zone will be heading in the next two years.
- He is pleased that the Member States spoke with one voice at the international institutions in Singapore.
- Member of the Commission presents the first Commission Annual Report on the Euro Area to the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
- The predictions for growth in the euro zone for this year and the following two years have significantly improved.
- Economic indicators are pointing in the right direction, with rising economic growth, falling unemployment, stable inflation and clear reduction in public deficits.
- The Commission will present the Annual Economic Report to the Commission on 22 November.
- The report will include an evaluation of the degree to which each of the Member States has put these reforms into practice.
- The integration of the financial system is also a top priority for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
- The European Central Bank is one of the most transparent central banks in the world.
- According to Christian Democrats and European Democrats, the euro is the EU's most potent response to globalisation and all EU Member States need to join the euro zone.
- The Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket and the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy.
- PERSON069 welcomes the debate in plenary to review the operation of the euro zone.
- The report presents an opportunity for review at a time when the Stability Pact has been revised.
- The euro zone has been operating for six years and its first enlargement revealed that the Maastricht criteria established more than a decade ago no longer correspond to the reality of the enlarging EU and the developing global economy.
- PERSON071 thanks rapporteur García-Margallo y Marfil for the report on the situation in the euro zone.
- He is disturbed by the fact that from 2007, macro-economic policy coordination and the internal market will involve all 27 Member States.

- Growth in the euro zone has been the lowest in the world for many years.
- The European Central Bank is trying to impose harmonisation of budgetary and tax policies in the Member States.

- PERSON078 supports the proposal by the opposition in the European Parliament concerning the 2006 declaration on the anniversary of the euro zone.
- He believes the varying rates of inflation among euro zone Member States do not reflect different approaches to macroeconomic policy, but are the result of structural factors.
- The new Member States are more susceptible to fluctuations in the price of energy and raw materials.
- The current approach to assessing inflation criteria is inappropriate and may in the long run diminish the chances of new member states gaining entry to the Eurozone.
- The European Parliament has received a report on the economic situation of the euro zone.
- The Commission's macroeconomic policy affects the daily lives of millions of Europeans whose purchasing power is threatened by stagnating salaries and an increase in the cost of living.
- The practical response offered by the Commission and the European Central Bank is to fight inflation through budgetary austerity and wage cuts.
- The euro zone's economic report is perhaps a little better this year, but its social and political performance remains as bad as ever.
- The value of the euro is rising, but there are still 100 million people living below the poverty line in Europe and 75% of daily transactions are below the 5 euro line.
