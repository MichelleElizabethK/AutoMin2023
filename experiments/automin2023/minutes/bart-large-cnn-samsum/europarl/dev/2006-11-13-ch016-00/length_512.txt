SUMMARY
- José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil reports on the 2006 annual report on the euro area (2006/2239).
- It is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on economic situation in the euro zone.
- The report is divided into several sections: macroeconomic policy, reforms, with special emphasis on the internal market, and institutional issues.
- According to the report, monetary policy may be losing the momentum and budgetary policy must take up the torch.
- The Commission should adhere to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact and Member States should work harder at cutting their deficits.
- The report also calls for greater coordination of Member States' fiscal calendars and of the economic forecasts.

- Member of the Commission presents the first Commission Annual Report on the Euro Area to the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
- The predictions for growth in the euro zone for this year and the following two years have significantly improved.
- The economic indicators are pointing in the right direction.
- The existence of the euro zone has contributed to a favourable climate for families and businesses, thanks to the current level of interest rates and the protection the euro has provided against the turbulence of the financial markets.
- The Commission report on measures that should enable us to improve the operation of the area, according to Mr García-Margallo's report, recommends going further with structural reforms and consolidating the single market.
- The Annual Economic Report will be presented to the Commission on 22 November.
- The report will include an evaluation of the degree to which each of the Member States has put these reforms into practice.
- The integration of the financial system is also a top priority for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
- The European Central Bank is one of the most transparent central banks in the world.
- According to Christian Democrats and European Democrats, the euro is the EU's most potent response to globalisation and all EU Member States need to join the euro zone.
- The Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket and the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy.
- PERSON069 welcomes the debate in plenary to review the operation of the euro zone.
- The report presents an opportunity for review at a time when the Stability Pact has been revised and all agree that the commitments made by the Member States need to be better differentiated from those made outside of the zone.
- There is a need to link macro-economic analysis more closely with developments on the financial markets.
- The euro zone has been operating for six years and its first enlargement revealed that the Maastricht criteria no longer correspond to the reality of the enlarging EU and the developing global economy.
- The European Commission and the European Central Bank are applying different criteria of price stability to the euro zone.
- The stability of prices is established by considering more than just the rate of inflation.
- According to the rapporteur, prognoses for the euro zone look better than they have done for a long time.

- In the 2006 annual report on the situation in the euro zone, there is a much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment than in the USA and in the emerging markets such as China and India.
- The new Member States have even greater reservations about joining the euro, even though they are working hard to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria.
- The common currency and the policy of the ECB are serving the interests of finance capital at the cost of businessmen, consumers and the Member States' national budgets.

- PERSON078 supports the proposal by the opposition in the European Parliament concerning the 2006 declaration on the anniversary of the euro zone.

- The euro has risen from 0.87 cents to the dollar to 1.30.
- No country which does not have proprietary products can sell to the US.
- According to PERSON082, the lack of social system in the U.S. must not be left out of the equation when comparing the growth rate of the euro zone with that of the USA.
- People082 wants to get on top of the explosive growth of black-market work and cut down the bureaucratic hurdles that face small and medium-sized businesses.

- Europe is falling further behind the United States and Japan.
- Unresolved structural problems lie at the root of European stagnation.

- The macroeconomic policy in the euro zone needs to be improved.
- The common currency requires fiscal discipline and coordination of fiscal policy among the Member States.
