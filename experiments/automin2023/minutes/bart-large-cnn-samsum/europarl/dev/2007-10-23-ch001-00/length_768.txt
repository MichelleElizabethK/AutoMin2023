SUMMARY
- Neither the Socialist Group in the European Parliament nor the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) nor any of the other groups were informed about the wish for them to adopt a resolution on Russia this time, even though this has been rejected in the Conference of Presidents.
- The Socialist Group will be voting on it in any case and I believe the EPP has a similar idea.
- The PSE Group didn't know about this.
- They ask the President to postpone the vote to the next part-session.
