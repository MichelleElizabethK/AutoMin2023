SUMMARY
- PERSON181 presents the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers.
- It is a report of almost 400 pages.
- It has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive type-approval framework for all categories of motor cars, trailers and major component systems.
- The new type-approval directive brings into play the bus directive that many of us worked on.
- It will be brought into play as the single homologation approval framework for buses across the European Union.
- The new scheme of type approvals for after-market parts affected the environmental and safety systems of vehicles.
- The lower volume vehicle limit was raised to a thousand vehicles for simplified type approval.
- Wheelchair accessible vehicles were modified to allow access by wheelchair passengers.
- The producers of those vehicles are pleased to be recognised.
- Tomorrow the Council will vote on a new directive on the type approval of cars, lorries, buses and trailers.
- The German Presidency congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, on his report and thanks him for his work.
- The directive extends the European type approval, that has hitherto been foreseen for passenger cars, to lorry, bus and trailer trailers.
- All new vehicles in the European Union will have to meet the same safety standards.
- New vehicles will have to comply with a series of directives on technical harmonisation in the field of vehicle safety.
- Small and medium-sized enterprises will have easier access to the internal market.
- Manufacturers of special purpose vehicles or small series vehicles and body-builders will benefit from simplified procedures, which will not involve too much red tape.
- PERSON185 and PERSON186 support the compromise on access to vehicle repair information for independent garages.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament also supports the agreement reached between the three European Union institutions at the second reading.
- The vote on the compromise will take place tomorrow.
