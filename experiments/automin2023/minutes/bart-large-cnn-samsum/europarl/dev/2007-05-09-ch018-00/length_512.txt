SUMMARY
- The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles.
- PERSON182 presents the report on behalf of the committee tonight.
- It is a report of almost 400 pages and it is one of the biggest reports to come before this Parliament.
- It has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive type-approval framework for all categories of motor vehicles, trailers, major component systems and critical components.
- This is a notable achievement on Europe Day.
- The new type-approval directive brings into play the bus directive that many of us worked on.
- It will be brought into play as the single homologation approval framework for buses across the European Union.
- The new scheme of type approvals for after-market parts affected the environmental and safety systems of vehicles.
- The lower volume vehicle limit was raised to a thousand vehicles for simplified type approval.
- Wheelchair accessible vehicles were modified to allow access by wheelchair passengers.
- The producers of those vehicles are pleased to be recognised.
- Tomorrow the Council will vote on a new directive on the type approval of cars, lorries, buses and their trailers.
- The German Presidency reached an agreement with the European Parliament on the remaining outstanding issues.
- All new vehicles in the European Union will have to meet the same high safety standards.
- The proposal for a directive is intended to speed up the process of placing vehicles on the market in the Member States.
- Since 1996, the directive on the type approval of motor vehicles has been the European Community's most important legal instrument for creating the internal market.
- In 2006, two million new vans and more than a quarter of a million new lorries of over 16 tonnes were licensed in the Community.
- New vehicles will have to comply with a series of directives on technical harmonisation in the field of vehicle safety.
- Small and medium-sized enterprises will have easier access to the internal market.
- Manufacturers of special purpose vehicles or small series vehicles and body-builders will benefit from simplified procedures, which will not involve too much red tape.
- PERSON185 supports the compromise that has been negotiated with the Presidency on access to vehicle repair information for independent garages.
- He also appeals to Commissioner Verheugen to ensure that the political will of Parliament and the Council is respected in the negotiations on technical implementation of Euro 5.
- PERSON186 and PERSON187 are happy that an agreement has been reached between the three European Union institutions at the second reading.
- The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to have these provisions implemented very quickly.
- The text clarifies the technical administrative provisions on type approval and extends them at Community level to all motor vehicles including buses and commercial vehicles.
- The provisions on adapting vehicles to the needs of people with disabilities have also been improved.
