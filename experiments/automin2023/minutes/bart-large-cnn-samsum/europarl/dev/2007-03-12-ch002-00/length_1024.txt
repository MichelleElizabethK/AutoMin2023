ATTENDEES : PERSON006, PERSON007


SUMMARY
- There was a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism before the plenary sitting this afternoon.
- PERSON006 had no advance notice of this event.
- The sitting was chaired before 3 p.m. by Mr Cavada, the chairman of this House's home affairs committee, and rapporteur was Mr Sifunakis, who is a member of PERSON006's group.
- PERSON007 was unable to keep a very important appointment at half past three, so the whole thing lasted until just before 4 pm.
