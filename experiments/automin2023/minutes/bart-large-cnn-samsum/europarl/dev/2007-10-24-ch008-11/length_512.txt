ATTENDEES : PERSON114, PERSON115, PERSON116


SUMMARY
- PERSON114 wants the report by Mrs Wallis on Mr Gobbo to be referred back to the committee on the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
- She believes that the rapporteur and the committee are confused over the difference between Article 9 and Article 10 of the Protocol.
- PERSON115 thinks Parliament is not competent to express a view on the facts alleged against Gian Paolo Gobbo because he was not a Member of the European Parliament at the time of the facts.
- PERSON116 confirms there was a full debate in committee before the report was presented in plenary and the majority voted in favour of it.
