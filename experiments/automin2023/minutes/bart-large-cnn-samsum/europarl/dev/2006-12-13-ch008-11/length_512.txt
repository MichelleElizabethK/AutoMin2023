SUMMARY
- The International Fund for Ireland has contributed EUR 803 million of funding and leveraged a further EUR 1.46 billion in supporting 5700 projects and the creation of 55 000 direct and indirect jobs.
- It is also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tensions and bridging the divisions between the two traditions on the island.
- This will be the last time that the EU will ask for funding for this programme, as the International Fund will cease in 2010.
