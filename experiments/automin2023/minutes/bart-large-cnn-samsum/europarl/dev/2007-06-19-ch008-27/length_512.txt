SUMMARY
- The report represents 18 months of work of a committee of inquiry of this House.
- This morning colleagues from various groups asked for a roll-call vote on the report.
- Mr President will consider the request.
- The vote should have taken place yesterday, but the number of colleagues who asked for it now makes it unlikely.
