SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the reports on the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005 and on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013) C 6-0158/2006.
- The modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
- The present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992.
- It has not kept pace with the changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate.
- The Commission's proposal for a modernised Customs Code, the proposals on the Council table and e-customs will make customs work better, faster and cheaper.
- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are discussing the modernised Customs Code, 'paperless Customs', and 'Customs 2013 programme'.
- They discuss the importance of customs and their role in the European Union's desire for competitiveness and efficiency.
- The Customs Code dates from 1992.
- The new Code includes 200 articles.
- The most controversial points concern the customs representative, the authorised economic operator, centralised customs clearance and comitology.
- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted amendments to the Customs 2013 programme.
- The programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges and simplify and speed up customs procedures.
- PERSON146 congratulates Commissioner on the modernisation of customs legislation.
- He also congratulates Mrs Fourtou on her work on the issue of international trade.
- People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats withdraw their amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee on Internal Market.
- PERSON148 is pleased with the progress of the reform of the Customs Code.
- He is in favour of the amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the economic operators authorised and on free electronic customs processing.
- He believes it would be a good thing to simplify customs procedures, which hinder the internal market.
- The Community Customs Code is a modernisation of the Customs Code in force since 1992.
- It is designed to benefit commercial entities and customs administrations, reduce the cost of customs formalities and respond to commercial challenges involving safety and protection, detecting counterfeits and money laundering, and also protecting health and the environment.
- The document is inextricably linked to the report on computerisation of Customs procedures.
- Trans-European information networks are provided for, to facilitate the completion of Customs formalities.
- The Customs Union has been considered a cornerstone of the European Community.
- The proposal is to create a customs and trade environment based on improved effectiveness of customs clearance procedures through information exchange, elimination of the administrative burden, and facilitation of trade at European and international levels.
- The code currently in force dates back to 1992.
- It must be modernised to reflect the changes that have taken place and must address those changes.
- Security needs to be increased at various levels to protect public health, to ensure food safety and to combat crimes such as money laundering, counterfeiting and fraud more effectively.
- Turkey has failed to implement the Ankara Protocol.
- Turkey promised the European Union 18 months ago that it would do so.
- PERSON155 supports the speech of the previous speaker and the proposal submitted today by the European Parliament.
- The European Union's customs system should serve two main purposes: protecting economic and financial interests and facilitating legal trade exchanges.
- Unfortunately, despite the existence of the Customs 2007 Programme and the allocation of almost EUR 150 million, these aims have not been fully achieved.
- The Commission has given appropriate consideration to Parliament's 58 amendments to the Modernised Customs Code and found 32 acceptable, 9 acceptable in principle or in part, and 17 unacceptable.
- The Commission supports all the amendments proposed by Parliament and hopes that the report by Mrs Fourtou will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority.
