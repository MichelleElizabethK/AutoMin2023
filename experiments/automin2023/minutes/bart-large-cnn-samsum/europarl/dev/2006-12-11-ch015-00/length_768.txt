SUMMARY
- There is a debate on the reports on the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005 and on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013).
- The present Customs Code was adapted in 1992.
- It has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate.
- The Competitiveness Council showed keen interest in the key elements of the reform on 4 December.
- Ministers gave strong support to the Commission's proposals on the single window, on centralised clearance and on customs agents.
- There was no debate on the e-customs proposal tonight.
- Parliament and the Committee on the Internal Market have full support for an ambitious Commission proposal.
- Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are discussing the modernised Customs Code, 'paperless Customs', and 'Customs 2013 programme'.
- They discuss the importance of customs and their role in the European Union's desire for competitiveness and efficiency.
- The Customs Code dates from 1992.
- The new Code includes 200 articles.
- The most controversial points concern the customs representative, the authorised economic operator, centralised customs clearance and comitology.
- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted amendments to the Customs 2013 programme.
- The programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges and simplify and speed up customs procedures.
- PERSON146 congratulates Commissioner and Mrs Fourtou on their work in modernising customs legislation.
- He wants to end the rivalry between the Committees on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on International Trade.
- He regrets that Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure has been violated in respect of strengthened cooperation between committees.
- He hopes that the European Commission will be forced to use the new comitology procedure with scrutiny.
- The Community Customs Code is an important project, which will remove persisting hurdles in the European internal market.
- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has reached a good compromise on Article 14 on authorised economic operators.
- The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will withdraw its Amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee.
- The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is presenting amendments to simplify customs procedures.
- The first group of amendments raises no difficulties as it adapts the comitology proposals to the new comittology agreement between Parliament and the other institutions.
- There are still issues outstanding, such as the issue of representatives at customs.
- PERSON149 thanks rapporteur Mrs Fourtou for her work.
- The European Union and its territories should be able to introduce special exemptions for their trade with the European Union.
- It is important for the EU to respond to the population's special needs and not get hung up on standard solutions that are appropriate for many but not for everyone.
- The reform of the Customs Code aims to simplify customs legislation and procedure.
- Mr President is pleased about the reports on customs codification.
- The World Customs Organisation in Brussels and the World Trade Organisation in Geneva are working on a global customs code.

- Security-related issues are becoming a priority and the proposal focuses on this area.
- PERSON154 thanks rapporteur for her work on the issue regarding customs policies.
- The biggest problem currently facing the EU is the unwillingness of Turkey to implement the Ankara Protocol.

- Turkey has failed to honour this political commitment.
- Up to eight chapters of Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU may be suspended this week.
- The European Union's customs system should serve two main purposes: to protect the Community's economic and financial interests and to facilitate legal trade exchanges.
- Unfortunately, despite the existence of the Customs 2007 Programme and the allocation of almost EUR 150 million, these aims have not been fully achieved.
- Customs brokers provide the necessary guarantee of knowledge and experience for the execution of customs operations.
- The Commission has given appropriate consideration to Parliament's 58 amendments to the Modernised Customs Code and found the majority acceptable, 9 acceptable in principle or in part and 17 unacceptable.

- PERSON158: The Commission cannot agree with Amendments 23 and 25 relating to customs fees.
- Amendment 30, 40 and 41 aim at granting benefits to railway companies.
- The Commission is confident that practical and appropriate solutions will be found so that the Modernised Customs Code can enter into force as planned in 2009.
