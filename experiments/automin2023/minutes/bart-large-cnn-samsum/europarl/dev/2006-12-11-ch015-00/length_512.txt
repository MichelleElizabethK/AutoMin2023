SUMMARY
- The next item is the joint debate on the reports on the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005 and on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013) C 6-0158/2006.
- The modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
- The present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992.
- It has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate.
- The current customs procedure and processes are unnecessarily complicated and do not reflect the changing focus of customs work.
- The Competitiveness Council showed keen interest in the key elements of the reform on 4 December.
- Ministers gave strong support to the Commission's proposals on the single window, on centralised clearance and on customs agents.
- The Commission's position on the accreditation of professional customs agents is not a matter for the Customs Code.
- There is no debate on the e-customs proposal tonight.
- PERSON145 presents the modernised Customs Code and the Customs 2013 programme reports to the European Parliament and the Council.

- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted an amendment that provides for recognition of the existence of practical standards of competence or professional qualifications in order to satisfy those Member States for whom the abolition of this monopoly is difficult to accept.
- Centralised customs clearance is a facilitation that, in principle, has been well received but Member States are wondering about collection of customs duties.
- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted a radical position in demanding that electronic customs clearance operations should be free of charge and that customs-offices should be open 24 hours a day.
- The Committee on International Trade adopted amendments for the codecision procedure for certain provisions that would normally fall within their competence.
- The Customs 2013 programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years.

- The amendments adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection are in line with the work of the Council.
- PERSON146 congratulates Commissioner and Mrs Fourtou on their work in modernising customs legislation.
- He wants to end the rivalry between the Committees on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on International Trade.
- He regrets that Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure has been violated in respect of strengthened cooperation between committees.
- He hopes that the European Commission will be forced to use the new comitology procedure with scrutiny.

- The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has reached a good compromise on Article 14 on authorised economic operators.
- The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will withdraw its Amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee.
- There have been no disputes among MEPs on the issue of the Amendment 57.

- The Ã…land Islands, Channel Islands, the Canaries, Agios Oros in Greece and overseas French departments should have special exemptions for their trade with the EU.
