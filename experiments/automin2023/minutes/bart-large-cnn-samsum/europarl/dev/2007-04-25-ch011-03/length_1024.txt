SUMMARY
- The Committee on Transport and Tourism originally approved Amendment 46 and Amendment 50.
- The services have noted that there is some incompatibility between them, with regard to certain dates.
- The best solution is an oral amendment to Amendment 46 that consists of a simple addition: 'and in any case not later than 1 July 2008'.
- This would not change the meaning of either of the amendments and would provide a legal solution to this conflict.
