SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
- It is titled "CARS 21" and it is on the topic "A Competitive Automobile Regulatory Framework".
- On 19 December, the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
- Verheugen has just been debating and voting on the report presented by his colleague Chris Davies.
- The CARS 21 report also covers many aspects that have nothing to do with CO2.
- The industry is one of the cornerstones of Europe's economy and is a key factor for European competitiveness.
- Europe has been setting the standard at international level and 80% of the world's top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe.
- The significance of CARS 21 extends beyond the automotive sector.
- It is the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
- The European car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the European Commission has put forward in its proposal.
- The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
- The European Commission is about to start a consultation on CO2 emissions regulations.
- The Commission wants to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry.
- The introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive.
- The automotive industry in Europe is under attack from international competitors.
- PERSON072 was responsible for drafting the relevant report for the INTA Committee.
- The automotive industry provides the European economy with a significant number of jobs.
- 2.3 million people work directly in it and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors.
- The Employment and Social Committee congratulates Jorgo Chatzimarkakis for preparing the report.
- There are 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars.
- Mr Ferber of the CSU threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDU/CSU Group would not support a second mandate if he continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry.
- Mr Verheugen is cross with Mr Sarkozy.
- Mr Chatzimarkakis' report falls behind what Chris Davies produced.
- PERSON076 wants Commissioner Verheugen to take a message to Mr Dimas to explain how the process he is using to develop the regulation is compatible with the CARS 21 proposal.
- Member States are missing from the debate.
- Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARs 21 initiative, but questions their commitment.
- PERSON079 congratulates Commissioner Verheugen on setting up the CARS 21 high-level group to examine the European automotive industry.
- Jorgo Chatzimarkakis recommends greater investment in research and development in the automotive sector and the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts.
- PERSON081 welcomes the proposal to set a target of 125 g/km of CO2 by 2015.
- He is sorry that the target values should be based on weight, because it removes an incentive to reduce the weight of cars.
- He apologises for saying that Michael O'Leary did not give a toss for the environment, but he wants to work with the car industry to reduce CO2.
- Car emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions.
- Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
- The European automotive industry is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2.
- Car manufacturing employs 12 million people in Europe.
- The proposed CO2 regulation is hostile to innovation.
- PERSON086 congratulates Rapporteur for the work on the report on the European Union's car industry.
- He supports the target of 125 g of CO2 emissions per vehicle, which is acceptable and a step forward.
- The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledge-based economy only if it invests enough in research and integration of research into industrial production.
- PERSON090 congratulates Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report.
- He urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions and the protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry.
- He highlights the importance of road safety objectives, vehicle technology improvements, infrastructure measures, and education and information.
- Tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage.
- The European car industry is one of the most important sectors of the European Union's economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year and creating 2.3 million jobs.
- PERSON093 and Mr Turmes are critical of the auto lobby's efforts to delay important environmental measures until 2015.
- Mr Verheugen said that the rules that we are laying down for the car industry would mean the relocation of European industry.
- The regulations will apply equally to all motor manufacturers worldwide.
- PERSON097 thanks his fellow Members for fair and open debate on climate protection, innovation and job security.
- Claude Turmes' remarks about Mrs Liotard were unfair.
- People's Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Chris Davies, is proud of his colleague Chris Davies for calling for practical limits and deadlines in his report.
