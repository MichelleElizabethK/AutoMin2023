- On 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
- Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, presents a report on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework for the 21st Century.
- It is important for the European Parliament to be consistent in its decision-making on the issue.

- The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States.
- Europe needs to strengthen its position in the market and invest more in vehicle research.
- The significance of CARS 21 extends beyond the automotive sector.
- It is the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
- The European car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the European Commission has put forward in its proposal.
- The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
- The European Commission is about to start a consultation on CO2 emissions regulations.
- The Commission wants to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry.
- Everything that they have already agreed on by way of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards will make European motor cars much more expensive.
- The introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be expensive.

- 2.3 million people work directly in the car industry and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors.
- 7 percent of all people working in the industrial sector of the Community could lose their jobs due to structural changes.
- There are 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars.
- Mr Ferber of the CSU threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDU/CSU Group would not support a second mandate if he continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry.
- Mr Verheugen is cross with Mr Sarkozy.
- Mr Chatzimarkakis' report falls behind what Chris Davies produced.
- PERSON076 wants Commissioner Verheugen to take a message to Mr Dimas and ask him to explain how the process that he is using to develop the regulation is compatible with the CARS 21 proposal.
- Member States are missing from the debate on the report.
- They are the ones who behave idiosyncratically in their national regulations.

- The Commission could take more action on intellectual property rights.
- The automotive sector is a source of jobs, competitiveness, growth and innovation.
- The targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions are in line with the Davies report adopted in October.
- Malcolm Harbour is the shadow rapporteur for the report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- He is convinced that preserving and increasing the competitiveness of the European automotive industry is closely tied to the question of how eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable vehicles stamped 'made in Europe' will be in the future.
- He welcomes the implementation of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles.
- He thinks that a set-up time of 12 years would be sufficient to achieve the 120 g/km target by 2012 and the introduction of CO2 legislation by 2015.
- PERSON081 welcomes the proposal to set a target of 125 g by 2015 for the car industry.
- He is sorry that the rapporteur proposed that the target values should be based on weight, because it removes an incentive to reduce the weight of cars.
- The industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields.
- There are more than 200 regulations in existence today.
- PERSON083 thanks rapporteur Chatzimarkakis for his report on the regulation of the automotive industry.
- The European Parliament believes car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 g/km by 2015.
- Transport emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions.
- Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
- European industry is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2.
- PERSON085: Car manufacturing employs 12 million people in Europe and is one of Europe's key industries.
- It is important to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness, but there is a fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions.
- Lifestyle criticism has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate.
- The proposed CO2 regulation is hostile to innovation, for the money that car manufacturers will have to pay is needed for research.
- PERSON087 congratulates the rapporteur for his work on the report on climate change and the European Union's investment in research and development of the EU's car industry.
- He believes the EU car industry can cope with targets set at high levels through research, development and development.
- PERSON090 congratulates Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report.

- Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by a large majority.
- People's Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is concerned about the increase in CO2 emissions of motor traffic.
