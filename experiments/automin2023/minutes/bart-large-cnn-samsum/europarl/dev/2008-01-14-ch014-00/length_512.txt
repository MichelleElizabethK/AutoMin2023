SUMMARY
- The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework.
- On 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
- The public is interested to see how the European Parliament will react to this proposal.
- 80% of the world's top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe.
- CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century.
- The aim of the exercise was to identify the adjustments that would have to be made to the automotive industry in order to keep this sector competitive in the years ahead.
- PERSON070: Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts, equal safety standards for the automotive tuning sector and an EU-wide type-approval system for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere.
- The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States.
- Europe needs to strengthen its position in the market and invest more in vehicle research.
- The significance of CARS 21 extends far beyond the automotive sector.
- It is also the model for Europe's future industrial policy.
- The European car industry is a key industry for Europe, for technological development, for growth and, last but not least, for employment.
- The car is part of our European way of life.
- It must be affordable, it must be safe and reliable.
- The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre.
- This is not inconsistent with the 125 grams mentioned by Mr Chatzimarkakis.
- 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of bio-fuels.
- Car industry will benefit from the legislator-driven innovation surge.
- The European Commission is about to start a consultation on CO2 emissions regulations.
- The Commission wants to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry.
- Everything that they have already agreed on by way of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards will make European motor cars much more expensive.
- The introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be expensive.
- The small and medium-sized vehicle market is under attack from international competitors.
- I am concerned for the future of a large number of European manufacturers.
- I believe it is absolutely vital for all industrial products, including the motor cars, to be taken to the maximum level of eco-friendly development that is technically feasible.
- PERSON072 was responsible for drafting the report for the INTA Committee.
- The automotive industry is the world's largest producer of cars and second biggest producer of lorries.
- It needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements, increasing productivity, improving safety and benefiting the environment.
- There are 2.3 million people working in the car industry and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors in the Community.
- 7 percent of all people work in the industrial sector.
- Community funds allocated for enterprises undergoing reconstruction should reach the employees.
- It is also necessary to support those who want to start their own business.
- There are 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars.
- Last week Tata Motors brought out a cut-price motor car that averages five litres per hundred kilometres.
- Hundreds of millions of private cars will appear on the roads of the emergent nations.
- Mr Ferber of the CSU threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDU/CSU Group would not support a second mandate if he continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry.
- Mr Verheugen is cross with Mr Sarkozy because he and Mr Prodi wrote a letter that sought to ensure that the Commission would not set the growth curve at 80.
- Mr Chatzimarkakis' report falls behind what Chris Davies produced.
- Mr Verheugen is calling for a solid framework to set an energy efficient target for 2020.
- There is no mention of this in the Commission's proposal or in his report.
- Parliament should produce a proposal on energy efficiency by 2020.
- PERSON076 wants Commissioner Verheugen to explain to Mr Dimas how the process he is using to develop the regulation is compatible with the CARS 21 proposal.
- Member States are missing from the debate.
- They are the ones who undermine the achievement of the stable framework and the internal market.
- PERSON077 has a few suggestions in the opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century.
- The Commission has disregarded the CARS 21 Group's integrated approach to reducing emissions.
- Biofuels should be promoted in order to achieve the aim of increasing the use of biofuels.
- The Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative, but questions Member States' commitment to the integrated approach.
- They would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution and the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive.
- They also want to improve cross-border inspections and enforcement of traffic rules.
- PERSON079 congratulates Commissioner Verheugen on creating a high-level group, CARS 21, to examine the European automotive industry.
- He would like to see representation that gives greater consideration to the diversity of professions covered by the sector and greater involvement of the European Parliament.
- Malcolm Harbour is the shadow rapporteur for the report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
- He is convinced that preserving and increasing the competitiveness of the European automotive industry is closely tied to the question of how eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable vehicles stamped 'made in Europe' will be in the future.
- He welcomes the implementation of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles.
- He thinks that a set-up time of 12 years would be sufficient to achieve the 120 g/km target by 2012 and the introduction of CO2 legislation by 2015.
- The car industry should have reduced its emissions by a great deal more than it has, but it takes time to achieve change economically.
- The rapporteur's proposal to set a target of 125 g by 2015 is ambitious, but achievable.
- The Commission's proposal for a gradual phase-in of penalties after 2012 is not consistent with the vote in October.
- PERSON082 supports the report on emissions reduction in the automotive industry.
- The industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields.
- There are more than 200 regulations in existence today affecting the industry, so reducing emissions in this industry will be a difficult task.
- PERSON083 thanks rapporteur Chatzimarkakis for his excellent report on the European Parliament's report.
- He questions the European Commission's proposal to set emission standards for new private cars.
- He also questions the time within which the European automotive industry is able to meet the technologically ambitious emissions targets.
- Car emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions.
- Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars.
- The European automotive industry is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2.
- The CARS 21 High Level Group was dominated by a conservative branch of industry.
- Car manufacturing employs some 12 million people and is one of Europe's key industries.
- Mr President wants to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness.
- Lifestyle criticism has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate.
- Mr Verheugen has said that he doesn't want to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism.
- The car of today is different from the car of 100 years ago.
- Europe needs a competitive car industry to contribute to the global agenda and to better standards for the environment in the global economy.
- The target of 125 g is acceptable and a step forward.
- Small and big cars play different roles in different parts of the Union.
- The report makes a good contribution towards that.
- PERSON087 congratulates Rapporteur for the work on the report on climate change.
- 70% of European citizens expect the Union to show active involvement in dealing with pollution and traffic problems.
- The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledge-based economy only if it invests enough in research.
- The development of the European automotive industry will lead to the preservation and creation of jobs.
- Member States should devise tax incentives for end-users to encourage them to invest in greener cars.
- Such a system was introduced in Romania as early as 2003.
- The Commission proposes far-reaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhausts, improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels.
- The rapporteur has misgivings about targets which are difficult for industry to attain.
- The EU car industry can cope with high levels of ambition through research and development.
- PERSON089 thanks the rapporteur for the excellent report they are discussing.
- He believes Europe should focus on research to develop engines that run at a significantly higher temperature and more widespread use of software for control purposes to reduce CO2 emissions.
- He thinks Europe should be able to achieve the objectives it has set itself and become the leading industry within the automotive sector.
- PERSON090 congratulates Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report that urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets for the EU's automotive industry.
- He highlights the importance of road safety objectives, integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions, appropriate lead-times and protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry.
- Tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage.
- European and other medium-sized cars already meet the new standard of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
- The Seventh Framework Programme contains over EUR 4 billion of loans for the transport sector.
- Parliament wants more loans to be earmarked for research into new technologies.
- There is a proposal before the Commission to couple vehicle tax to the emission of harmful substances.
- The European Union's car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year and creating 2.3 million jobs.
- A further 10 million jobs are indirectly dependent on the industry.
- The EU has a EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation.
- However, the European car industry faces some serious challenges.
- Individual Member States apply different tax regimes concerning cars perpetuating the inequalities between consumers.
- European intellectual property has to be protected.
- There must be a maximum 120 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometre by 2012.
- Mr Verheugen said the rules for the car industry would as good as mean the relocation of European industry.
- The regulations will apply equally to all motor manufacturers worldwide.
- The Japanese car industry will have to comply with these rules.
- PERSON095's comment on the connection between industrial policy and environmental policy was not related in any way to the car industry.
- He believes Europe has the opportunity and obligation to establish Europe as the lead market for environmentally-friendly cars.
- The few hundred Chinese cars that are currently to be found in Europe are of dubious quality.
- The only working hydrogen-powered cars in the world are to be found in Europe.
- Nobody else is spending more on research in this area than Europe.
- European car manufacturers and the European automotive suppliers have been working on a series of technological breakthroughs that will enable them to achieve their objectives.
- Commissioner responsible for industry would be happy to support such a proposal.
- PERSON097 thanks his fellow Members for a fair and open debate on climate protection, innovation and job security.
- Claude Turmes' remarks about Mrs Liotard were unfair.
- Chris Davies is greener and more ecologically minded than anyone else in the ALDE Group.
- Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by a large majority.
- People's Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is concerned about the increase in CO2 emissions of motor traffic.
- The car manufacturers' voluntary agreements on emissions reduction are not working and the Union's regulations are powerless.
- The only success is that the average consumption by cars was 12.4% less in 2004 than in 1995.
