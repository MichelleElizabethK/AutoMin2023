ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-

  There call last week integration, new NMTAPI.
  There will deliverable in December.
  There questions from PERSON12 navigation, list produced by empty system.
  agree to provide separate PERSON1 set annotation of purpose translations.
  current findings quality estimation worsens user confidence, also worsens translation quality.
 -PERSON14, PERSON9 writing paper for NASEL.
  quality estimation module used in previous experiments is not best one.
  Czech systems as expected , student one is faster, users confident.
 -PERSON9 , PERSON14, PERSON2 discussing results of analysis.
  users confident if get response faster , it is faster.
 -PERSON2 does not understand second graph.
 -PERSON9 explains to fastest system allows for twice as many actions.
 -PERSON2, PERSON9 discuss pros, cons of fast system, slow one.
 -PERSON1, PERSON2 showing graph with back translated data.
  data is monolingual back translated from Chinese to English.
  pretraining is performed on mix of eh , back transla Monolingual Back translated data, parallel back of PERSON1, PERSON2 explain to performance of system improved after fine tuning.
 -PERSON1, PERSON2 discussing pros, cons of using monolingual data for training.
  There is difference between red, blue curve in case of fully monolingual data for synthetic data.
  If have less 50 % of monolinguistic data , blue curve is better , if have 50 % , red one is better.
 -PERSON1 wants to fine tune models on currently best pretrained models.
  will talk to PERSON7 as well.
 -PERSON2 suggests using data, using text to mark source , instead of fine tuning.
 -PERSON1 thinks it is good idea to start with training on back translation, continue with fine tuning on on open data.
 -PERSON1 wants to finish monolingual part of research as soon as possible , continue with multingual part.
 -PERSON2 translating from English to Czech, got worst Bleu scores.
 -PERSON11 wants to run constraints lemmatized constraints.
 -Person6 wants to check behavior of stem changes when constraints provided as as lemmas.
 -Person2 wants to generate possible word forms from constraints, give system set PERSON6, PERSON2 discuss ideas to improve computer program.
 -PERSON6, PERSON11 trying to solve problem with LMT system.
  want to know if using lemmas as hard constraint might help them improve system.
 -PERSON11 is travelling to Czech Republic tonight.
  She will take plane to first city tomorrow, second one on Wednesday.
 -PERSON13 asked to book flight ticket to Czech Republic can discuss it later week.
  flight is usually cheapest on New PERSON2 , PERSON6 , PERSON11, PERSON10 going to meet on Friday one one p.
  will discuss what to do next for list discussedion.
 -PERSON10, PERSON11 working on system based on negative constraints.
 -PERSON6 , PERSON4 , PERSON2 , PERSON13, PERSON1 going to discuss on Friday whether not to give ORGANIZATION5 vouchers pay Czech people with money.
 -PERSON1, PERSON2 do not know is in charge of project.
  do not have inputs for people.
  will send them email addresses, will distribute work to towards them.
  contract still needs to negotiated.
  would bad if PERSON2 does not like idea of sending vouchers to PERSON4, PERSON13.
 -Person1 thinks it would faster to send them to PERSON13 has information financial matters.
