SUMMARY-
 -PERSON16 and PERSON4 are on a conference call.
  There is a deadline in six days and he has a lot of work to do.
  There are issues with confidentiality of the transcripts and the access to their talks before the event.
 -PERSON16 spent a whole day yesterday fixing a bug in Organization 2's servers.
  Organization2 couldn't connect to the machines at all.
  Organization 2 had a spare backup copy of their segmenter system, but it was not fully functional.
 -PERSON15, who is responsible for Organization 2 On Friday PERSON9 collected data on the first attempt to evaluate spoken language translation.
 -PERSON4 wants to try some modifications of the Rainbow model to improve performance on ASR.
 -PERSON4, PERSON6, PERSON9, PERSON16 and PERSON19 will prepare the baseline workers and the domain adapted ones for the demo.
 -PERSON16 has sent the short three minute transcript to PERSON4.
 -PERSON4 will correct it and send it to PERSON11.
 -PERSON11 will prepare the videos in English and Czech.
  The deadline for the demo is for this Friday or next Friday.
 -PERSON4, PERSON16 and PERSON22 will prepare a demo for the demo on Thursday.
  They need the data from PERSON12 and the speech transcript from PERSON19 to create a talk level adaptation sub drive.
 -PERSON4, PERSON9, PERSON21 and PERSON22 will train their own ORGANIZATION4 system.
  The system was provided by PERSON21, but it was just a system run.
 -PERSON4 wants to make three identical copies of the same thing.
  The platform is free to downgrade to more generic models, and that could change the behaviour of the pipeline.
  When I use domain adapted and lauch a worker that very fingerprint should have a unique signature.
