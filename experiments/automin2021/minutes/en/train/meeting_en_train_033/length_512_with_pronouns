ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-
 -PERSON9, PERSON13, PERSON8, PERSON11, PERSON16, and PERSON4 are having a test run tomorrow in the afternoon.
  Thursday is national holiday in Germany and Friday off, so Thursday is the only day of the week that people can work.
  The test run will PERSON3 can start the systems today.
 -PERSON9, PERSON11, PERSON17 and PERSON12 will set up a second mediator for the test session.
 -PERSON17 wants to set up a second instance machine and use a different set of ports, so the switch should be extremely fast.
  The details of the mediator will be available here in the ORGANIZATION8 Document, where I asked PERSON13 to enter the details.
  The PERSON9 asks PERSON11 to highlight the languages that can be supported in the subtitling platform.
  There is a problem with the streaming of slides to the presentation platform of Organization 2.
 -PERSON2 will take care of it tomorrow and Friday.
 -PERSON9, PERSON16, PERSON10, PERSON8 and PERSON16 are on a conference call.
  They discusseded the critical observations from the document.
 -PERSON16 will make sure that the recording is happening.
 -PERSON9 and PERSON16 have collected their logs from the PROJECT1 session.
  They will record the audio as a basis of a test set.
  They will work on the audio over the coming months to polish the pipeline.
  They will make sure to let everybody know when the document ORGANIZATION8 document is up to date with all the requests.
  The incremental ASR wasn't working as it was described by Organization 5.
  The timestamps were missing, so it was impossible to tell the The timestamps for each token are in the packages, but they are not in the WG session.
  If you request unsegmented text, you receive a token again that overlaps the previous one.
  When you request the same language that is spoken by the text client, you PERSON14 advises PERSON8 to use the real time mode.
  It didn't work in the dry run.
 -PERSON16 uses two clients, one for one instance of the client and one for the other.
  The second client doesn't send timestamps to the first one.
  They and PERSON8 are having problems with the ASR worker.
  They need to change the client and measure the times when they receive the messages.
  They also need to monitor the sound channels.
 -PERSON16, PERSON2 and PERSON8 are trying to solve a problem with the presentation layer of the platform.
  They need to record to the ASR and archive it.
 -PERSON17 worked on a newer version of the published worker.
  There is a problem with empty deliverance some output was number segment and there is not enough space into subtitle window so they need to change the subtitling window.
  The presentation platform is not big enough to display a PERSON17 explains to PERSON16 how the presentation platform works.
 -PERSON16, PERSON17, PERSON2 and PERSON9 discussed the results of the experiment.
  They, PERSON8 and PERSON17 discusseded the implementation of a presentation.
  They discussed some technical issues with it.
  The server doesn't notice that the socket is closed, because it takes a long time to shutdown.
  The interpreter interpreters want to see the whole output but only some specific times.
  The congress is in May next year.
  There are PERSON16 is debugging all the subtitles until he's shown output.
 -PERSON8, PERSON14 and PERSON16 discussed the issue of the timestamps.
 -PERSON14 explains to PERSON8 and PERSON16 how to get immediate results from the client.
  The timestamps from the ASR are lost.
 -PERSON8 needs them in order to know when the text is being updated, when it's transmitting from unstable to stable, otherwise they have to resort.
 -PERSON9 did some distinguishing of of partial, not partial hypothesis in his chapter.
  They doesn't understand why the empty worker can't access the timing information from ASR.
 -PERSON14 explains the difference between ASR and MT.
 -PERSON8 and PERSON14 don't understand why they don't get the time offset from the audio.
  They explains to PERSON14 and PERSON17 how the pipeline works.
  They and PERSON14 are arguing about the timestamps in the log file from Project1 live demo.
  The log file is not accurate, because the timing information does not come from any audio information.
 -PERSON14, PERSON3 and PERSON8 are trying to figure out why the timestamps were not recorded properly during the dry run.
  They suspect it might be related to the multiple clients that PERSON2 was talking about.
  They and PERSON17 agree that in principle it should work in principle, but they need to address the issue between the and text on the presentation platform.
 -PERSON17, PERSON8 and PERSON16 worked on a project.
  At the moment, they do not have access to the correct timestamps for the dry run, so they cannot decide what to translate.
  They are also having problems with the intermediate steps.
