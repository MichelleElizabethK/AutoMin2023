ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-
 -PERSON9 is PhD student in ORGANIZATION3.
  She is going to clear labels for pipeline.
 -PERSON5 , PERSON9 , PERSON7 , PERSON3, PERSON8 want to test different versions of ASR worker also of machine translation worker.
 -PERSON9, PERSON8 discussing to label workers in way it is obvious when somebody changes worker to different version can test it.
  discuss to name workers , name fingerprints of workers, put version in name PERSON9, PERSON8 have two conflicting goals : workers not have to know what exact version of previous pipeline is run, empty workers not need to change input fingerprints.
  not possible to have goals time.
  API PERSON8 wants to extend cloud library.
  There is way to specify full path in communication protocol.
  Changing workers is manual process , of doctorisation.
 -PERSON8 , PERSON9, PERSON5 have to run test set over possible ASR workers , segmentation workers, empty workers on later tester.
  There is way to specify version of workers , need to run tests PERSON3 , PERSON8 , PERSON9, PERSON5 discussing changes to mediator, workers.
  mediator is supposed to automatic, provide control over workers , it is not possible to do in short period of time.
  ORGANIZATION5 mediator has not used for long time.
  There is restriction on making new public IP addresses.
 -People can run as many mediators as need , have to make sure workers want to test connected to PERSON3 , PERSON8, PERSON9 want to create pipeline will use output of one ASR worker from one mediator, one empty worker from another mediator.
  want to test it with two workers from different mediators.
  need to make PERSON8, PERSON9 working on solution to solve problem of working with multiple versions of workers in service architecture.
 -PERSON9 , PERSON5, PERSON8 going to meet in couple of days to discuss issue of multiple output fingerprints.
 -PERSON9 suggests to start client, explicitly request of intermediate fingerprints , including last field , is for information, versioning.
 -PERSON8, PERSON9 trying to set system allows them to request multiple fingerprints from client.
  problem is English to German workers running.
  solution is to change translation workers.
 -PERSON8 wants to investigate to extend ehm ensloud communication protocol in order to specify full path.
 -PERSON4 , PERSON8, PERSON9 agree it is okay, useful for others to have multiple workers have version of model.
 -PERSON4 would like to see Organization 3 worker for English in mediator soon , on first of December is metaphorum, on third is another meeting of ORGANIZATION1 preparation group.
 -PERSON9 suggests to PERSON4 also request as output intermediary fingerprints.
  intermediary is one is not input output.
  If fingerprint matching on service is strict , sound file will processed with one ASR, translated to French PERSON9, PERSON7 discussing possible failures of examle for examp.
 -PERSON8 shares with PERSON4 fingerprint text file created together with , is useful to have look.
 -PERSON5, PERSON6 need to bookmark it.
 -PERSON9 wants to investigate to separate different versions of workers.
 -PERSON4 , PERSON8, ORGANIZATION7 want to keep record of versions of workers.
  also want to have deterministic behaviour for evaluation purposes.
 -PERSON8, PERSON4 want to know description, service name of PROJECT2 test set.
  want to label outputs with service name.
  There is way to do it.
  client knows session ID of service does not know PERSON9 wants to know is difference between using description, version in fingerprint, noting version of fingerprint.
 -PERSON4 explains two PROJECT1 NMT systems.
  One of machines from cluster has different GPU card, PERSON9 , PERSON4, PERSON7 arguing implementation of protocol.
 -PERSON9 wants PERSON4 , PERSON5, PERSON4 to make sure test is done, know answer.
 -Person9 wants every partner to label workers with date of department.
 -PERSON8 , PERSON5, PERSON9 going to schedule test together next week.
 -PERSON8, PERSON9 working on new client bug procedure in Java , it does not share pipeline with clients.
  mediator does not use instance of ASR for te ASR output, machine translation , test ca not PERSON8 , PERSON5 , PERSON3, PERSON9 going to make hands on session, simulate use case in order to design intermediate solution.
