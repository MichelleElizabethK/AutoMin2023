ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-
 -PERSON9 is PhD student master in Organizedation3.
  She adding profile in ORGANIZATION4 database , does not want to listed as master student on organisation website.
  She thinks fingerprinting , workers, PERSON9 , PERSON3 , PERSON7, PERSON8 discussing to test different versions of ASR worker also of machine translation worker.
 -PERSON9, PERSON8 trying to solve issue of versioning in ASR system.
  have two conflicting goals : of workers not have to know what exact version of previous pipeline is run , able to request specific versions PERSON8 , PERSON9, PERSON5 explain to group to improve accuracy of transcription, translation.
  have to run test set over possible ASR workers , segmentation workers, empty workers.
  need to change fingerprints of workers PERSON3 , PERSON5 , PERSON8, PERSON9 arguing design of mediator.
  mediator is supposed to automatic, provide control to workers , it is not possible to do in short period of time.
  There is PERSON8, PERSON3 discussing to improve service architecture.
 -PERSON8, PERSON9 will meet in couple of days to discuss possible solutions to problem of working with multiple versions of workers.
 -PERSON9 suggests to start client, explicitly request of intermediate fingerprints , including last field , is for information, versioning.
  client can request one output fingerprint , can influence client to request multiple fingerprints.
 -PERSON9 wants to know if English to German workers running.
  There English to French workers , enEU , it is not easy to control.
 -PERSON4 , PERSON8, PERSON9 agree it is okay, useful for others to have multiple workers have version of model.
 -PERSON4 would like to see ORGANIZATION3 worker for English in mediator soon , on first of December is dryrun, on third is another meeting of Organization preparation group.
 -PERSON9 can request multiple inputs to client.
  If fingerprint matching on service is strict , sound will processed with one ASR, translated to French.
  If it is not strict , client will receive two ASRs, another ASR.
  PERSON9 , PERSON4 , PERSON5, PERSON6 want to know to control ASR workers.
 -PERSON8 shares with them fingerprint text file created long time ago.
 -PERSON9 suggests changing fingerprints right , changing it is not big deal PERSON8, PERSON4 asking questions integration of system.
  want to know model is, version of model gets propagated to version of worker.
  also need to know name of service , client does not know PERSON9, PERSON4 discuss differences between using description, noting version in fingerprint, using fingerprint with description.
 -PERSON9 wants PERSON4, PERSON5 to make sure test is done, use case works.
  going to evaluate individual components as well as full paths.
 -PERSON8, PERSON9 working on new ASR for English.
  Organized 7 uses instance of ASR , for te ASR output, machine translation.
  Organization 7 has access to Swisscode of mobile technology PERSON9 , PERSON5 , PERSON3, PERSON8 going to make hands on session, make simulation together to simulate use case in order to design possible intermediate solution.
