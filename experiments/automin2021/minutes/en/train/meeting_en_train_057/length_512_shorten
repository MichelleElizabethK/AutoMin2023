  runs for years PROJECT4, aims good publications.
 -PERSON9 would like to on grant formally.
  There problems with Cosine similarity measure.
  easy to calculate cosine similarity when have two vectors , it is not reasonable, interesting relation with similarity want.
 -PERSON9 focused on basic research , basic questions, analysis of what network is.
  She focus less on shared task, on technical, implementation work.
 -PERSON8, PERSON2 writing research paper.
  want to know if it is late to start writing paper , even if it is survey.
 -PERSON9 thinks it is better to switch cameras.
 -PERSON2, PERSON9 experiment.
  want results by end of week.
 -PERSON2, PERSON9 have paper on automatic matrix.

 -PERSON9 wants to know if separate scales for extractive, abstractive aspects of model.
 -PERSON2 , PERSON9, PERSON8 discuss difference between abstractive, extractive methods for summarizing information.
  decide to come with measure, automatic measure tells them whether given summary is abstractive extractive.
 -PERSON9, PERSON2 meeting.

 -PERSON5 will present user interface for annotation interface.
  There many versions of There three sub folders on disc : annotations , minutes, transcripts.
  An annotator can edit minutes add , add new minutes.
  dialog adds connected with first minute, highlighted with code colour.
  transcripts plain text with optional speaker.
  player synchron PERSON5 explains to PERSON8, PERSON9 program works.

  also have to prepare automatic minuting task.
 -PERSON6 explains in detail four stages of task.
  According to PERSON6 , main objective is to have minutes of entire transcript, filled agenda with minutes sentences matched to agenda topics.
  data scarcity problem solved by ORGANIZATION7, PROJECT1 corpora , processed in 2005, According to PERSON2 , ideal case would to launch shared task with data set PROJECT1, ORGANIZATION7.
  problem with two data sets format in XML.
  code to convert XML content into text content is in GitHub first stage of minuting pipeline is segmentation.
  task resembles sentence compression task.
  objective is to improve text quality.
  task is to preserve grammatical correctness of of clusters, to generate decisions from decisions phrases sentences.
  extractive approach is easier, convenient abstractive PERSON6 wants to produce software tool will read transcript, produce demonstrator based on it.
 -PERSON6 has presentation with different steps for dialog summarizations, scheme.
 -PERSON6 has data , code, code in GitHub , do not have working basic prototype.
  have to improve quality of text segmentation, dialog summarization.
 -PERSON8 wants to know much of task is actually implemented.
 -PERSON6 explains automatic evaluation is partial, needs to followed by human evaluation.
 -PERSON2, PERSON6 going to present slides for user, advisory board meeting next Wednesday.
 -Person2 wants to see outputs of experiments.
 -PERSON2 , PERSON6 , PERSON8, PERSON9 discussing details of manual evaluation measure for agenda completion.
 -PERSON2 explains to PERSON6 output of task five point three is already something annotators.
 -PERSON6 will put together reference minutes from ORGANIZATION7, PROJECT1, put them in alignment together.
 -PERSON8 wants to compare outputs of PERSON7, PERSON9 on ORGANIZATION7 corpus with manual summaries have.
  results not grammatically correct , semantically correct.
  Rouge scores low, also quality differences PERSON6 , PERSON8 , PERSON7, PERSON9 going to meet in September to discuss methods of manual evaluation of summaries.
 -PERSON6 explains to PERSON9 different methods for semantic evaluation.
  discuss differences between them, Rouge metric , is word-based metric based on Cosine similarity.
 -PERSON6 performed basic steps like tokenization with Stanford, Coroner LP.
  used unsupervised clustering methods for text segmentation.
  For task five three , he used transformer based models.
