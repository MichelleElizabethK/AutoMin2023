ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-
 -PERSON2 is recording the sound of the first meeting of the team.
  The purpose of the meeting is to get to know each other and explain to all others what they can expect from each other.
  Her task was to work with, automatic, transcripts and anno and correct them.
  She supervises the annotators who work on the data.
  He has a doctorate in machine translation.
 -PERSON2 supervises a research and innovation action called PROJECT4.
  The overall level of performance is insufficient for the application, but the task is clearly defined.
  There is another source of funding, which is basic research and it runs for more years, two more years than PROJECT PERSON2 and PERSON8 worked on a project.
  They need to create a measure that reflects the properties of the vector spaces and the analysis of what the network is doing.
  It is a technical and implementation work.
 -PERSON9 should focus more on the basic research questions and PERSON9, PERSON2 and PERSON7 are doing experiments on Organization 3 Meet.
  The results will be available by the end of this week.
 -PERSON2, PERSON9 and PERSON6 have a paper on automatic matrix.
  They discussed how to construct embeddings for each of the varying lengths of units.
 -PERSON2 and PERSON9 discusseded the difference between abstractive and extractive methods of summarizing information.
 -PERSON9 worked on a project that will measure whether people prefer to create abstractive style or extractive style for their summaries.
  There are problems with models that can talk in a semantic sense, like Botch and the universal encoder, but not in a meaningful way.
 -PERSON7 from the Indian institute of technology will be joining the team from September onwards.
  Her research so far has involved the documents processing.
  She is also preparing her own submission to the shared task.
 -PERSON2 and PERSON6 are in a meeting.
  The workshop confirmed the proposals in live.
  They will organise their own workshop on summarization and have a shared task.
 -PERSON2 and PERSON7 discusseded the shared task in a nonnative, speech recognition for nonnative English.
  The shared task is limited to 160 hours of training, which is ten times less than what people would like to have in English only settings.
 -PERSON2 wants to PERSON2 and PERSON7 will put up their own proposal for workshop on the 5th of October.
 -PERSON6 will introduce himself and introduce the background that is relevant for meeting summarization.
 -PERSON2 wants to know more about the Python workbench that PERSON6 worked on.
 -PERSON5 is creating the user interface for the annotators.
 -PERSON4 worked on a speech processing task.
 -PERSON2, who is in charge of the project, asks PERSON5 to present the annotation interface, PERSON6 to present slides and then PERSON8 to present data sets.
  The last person on the call is not officially employed on the project.
  He did an internship in LOCATION1 PERSON5 has been working on a new user interface for the transcript and minutes of the meeting.
  There are several panels that are important for the annotators.
  They can choose which transcript and which minutes to work with and which dialog adds to annotate them with the minute.
 -PERSON5 explains to PERSON8 and PERSON9 how the interface works.
  The main purpose of the interface is to link the minutes with the transcripts.
 -PERSON5 is creating an interface to link minutes and transcripts with the minutes and the transcripts.
  It will be useful for the annotators.
  The interface is not versioned yet, but it will be published in the PROJECT4 repository.
 -PERSON2, PERSON3, PERSON4, PERSON5, PERSON6, PERSON7, PERSON8 and PERSON9 are in a meeting.
 -PERSON6 wants to share his screen with the rest of the group, but he needs permission to do it.
  The meeting was set up by PERSON6 presents the slides from the PROJECT4 proposal.
  The presentation explains the full pipeline of the project.
  The participants will talk in different languages and their voices will be automatically translated into English.
  The system will probably use techniques like centred boundaries identification and other tema that remove PERSON6 explains in detail the four stages of a meeting preparation.
 -PERSON6 worked on a project to create a publishable corpus that can be used by the corporate community.
  The data set they worked on is an ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 corpora, both processed in 2005 and the most popular in the literature.
  The first step is to identify the speaker.
  The next step is the segment summarization.
  The final stage is the final deliverable.
 -PERSON6 and PERSON8 worked on a project.
  They want to produce a software tool that will read the transcript and produce the summary and active agenda in real time.
 -PERSON6 has all the data, the code and the code in GitHub repo, but they don't have the working basic prototype.
  They have to improve the quality of the text segmentation and the dialog summarization.
  The first experiments that they run with PERSON4 produced bad results.
 -PERSON2 would like to see the full outputs of the work package and the results of the experiments.
  They would also like to know how each of the components worked on the meetings.
  The slides are basic and will be extended in the future.
 -PERSON6 explains to PERSON2 the basic prototype of the evaluator's system.
  The evaluators will check on the available the summaries and the generated one.
  They will have to to evaluate the scale at which they match each other.
  The summary of the whole meeting PERSON2 wants to know the current status of the implementation and experiments.
 -PERSON6 is happy with the segmentation, but not satisfied with the results of task five point three.
  He will try to put together the reference minutes from ORGANIZATION7 and PROJECT1 and PERSON8 wants to compare the outputs of the ORGANIZATION7 corpus with the manual summaries.
  The results are not grammatically correct, but they are semantically correct.
  The Rouge scores are low and also the quality differences are significant.
  The manual summarizations are not correct PERSON9 wants to compare two minutes from semantically using an automatic metric.
 -PERSON6 suggests using Rouge or Gather like at One or Recall.
 -PERSON2 suggests a survey of methods of manual evalution of summaries.
 -PERSON9 wants to know if they used Stanford NLP library for text segmentation.
 -PERSON6 used transformer based models for task five three.
 -PERSON8 and PERSON9 worked on the data set.
  They have about one hundred and thirty-four hours of English and Czech transcripts, sixty four of their meetings transcribed, twenty-five of them double transcribed and twenty-four of them are double minuted.
  They PERSON2 wants PERSON10 to get some capacity for PROJECT4 within two months from now.
  She also wants PERSON8, PERSON9 and PERSON6 to help her with the paperwork.
  She wants them to retrain their pipeline on Sume Sumek and try it on the PERSON2 and Ed Howe will a joint corpora workshop.
  They will work on the similarity, abstractiveness and extractiveness of the data.
 -PERSON2 and PERSON9 had a successful first meeting.
  They will meet again in early September.
  It will be the official review of the PROJECT4 project on the 8th of September.
  They need to prepare slides for twenty minutes per work package.
 -PERSON8 needs to go out to take care of her children for half an hour.
  The agreement with all remote colleagues is that they will meet every day at some particular slot in the day, where there is one person from the LOCATION1 team.
