  They want to increase the number of segments from 2B to 2C.
 -PERSON11, PERSON8 and PERSON4 want to know when the next conference is and who will work on the analysis of the data.
 -PERSON4, PERSON11 and PERSON8 will write two papers with slightly different data.
  They have to ask Estonians and Czechians to assess the translation or evaluate the results.
 -PERSON4, PERSON7, PERSON8 and PERSON11 want to postpone the paper.
 -PERSON7, PERSON11, PERSON8 and PERSON4 will try to meet the deadline for Organizing 7.
  If they miss it, then the next one would be the January PROJECT8.

  They have a blue score of 27.
  They will train for a couple of data sets PERSON6, PERSON7 and PERSON8 are trying to figure out how to compare the different approaches.
 -PERSON6 suggests using TFIDF for all the variants and then using the three left references as the source of the constraints.
 -PERSON7 and PERSON8 are considering a system that restricts the system and pushes it to produce an output similar to the other references.
  They need to select a small set of the options and evaluate them manually in an annotation exercise.
  One of them has 50 references per sentence.
  The other one has four thousand three hundred references for each sentence.
 -PERSON6 is thinking about how to measure how many constraints work.
