SUMMARY-
 -PERSON4, PERSON6 and PERSON1 discusseded the guidelines for using the interface.
  The interface is not selecting text files into the interface, it is selecting only the folder or the files.
 -PERSON4, PERSON3 and PERSON6 are having problems with the interface.
  It took a lot of time to install and it's not uploading the minutes.
  It turns out that not all the annotators have the same kind of operating system, so they need to have a session with PERSON1 will ask five people to start working with alignment.
  The interface should run with at least two or three meetings, and then they would be able to see the output.
 -PERSON1, PERSON4 and PERSON3 worked on a shared task.
  They need to annotate, prepare a table and divide the data for the shared task as soon as possible.
 -PERSON4 has organized the data in the ORGANIZATION1 corpus in form of dates, in which day they occured.
  There are no minutes for the meeting that took place on 17th of January 2000.
  The minutes are in the form of chapters.
  The chapters are blank PERSON4 is trying to split a minute into the corresponding chapters.
  It's impossible to do manually, because the chapters are alt and the numbers are anywhere in the document.
 -PERSON1 and PERSON2 think it's easier to do it automatically, but it takes a lot of time.
