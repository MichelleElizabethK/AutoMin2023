ATTENDEES : PERSON13, PERSON10, PERSON18, PERSON3, PERSON19, PERSON6


SUMMARY-
 -PERSON6 , PERSON3 , PERSON5, PERSON7 working on presentation.
  presentation is shared task in minuting , in automatic summarization, prepare data for it , exact definition of what task what is inputs, outputs.
 -PERSON7 wants to know if is system for generating automatic minutes for meetings.
  There is , is system for summarizing minutes.
  One of annotators is machine translation model trained on large data sets.
 -PERSON6 wants to show horrible outputs of summarization training data to PERSON7, PERSON5.
  current training data is mainly from available data sets, domain is different.
  results poor, ultimate goal is to design automatic minuting system.
  ultimate goal is to create automatic system will automatically summarize meetings.
  However , moment do not have good starting point, do not know what done with word.
  One option is to start with summaries, generate fake meetings, train model on PERSON7 wrote mail.
 -PERSON5 will develop shared task, PERSON6 will develop deep neural network for generating summaries.
 -PERSON6 explains to PERSON7 if want to adopt abstractive style , need to train sequences to sequences deep network , see network finds data similar to what have in minutes.
  If choose extractive approach , need PERSON3, PERSON6 discuss differences between minutes of annotators A, B.
  discuss need to break task into smaller units.
 -PERSON6 , PERSON6, PERSON7 have original transcript , ASR transcript, corrected transcript.
  need to write number for of A, B summaries.
  also need to come with method for scoring.
  assignment is fluid, is strict assignment.
  annotators given transcript , first listen to sound, revise text , create minutes.
  second round of annotators reads transcripts, creates minutes A, B.

  discuss different minutes can look like.
  also discuss to personalize summaries.
 -PERSON6 wants to specify task of automatic meeting summarization.
  task annotators given is pretty hard.
 -PERSON6 , PERSON7, PERSON5 discussing minuting word package.
  discuss constraints of task, to fulfil assignment.
  One extreme way to do it is to create summary for everyone.
 -PERSON6 does not know to write good summary.
  does not want to constrain minds of students.
 -PERSON3 thinks it is better if define assignment for after have seen meetings.
 -PERSON5 asks professor PERSON6 for timeline for share task, when want to do it.
  project ends with end of 2021.
  call for proposal conference would start in September, submition would October November PERSON6 , PERSON5, PERSON3 want to prepare presentation on text summarization for workshop PROJECT3.
 -PERSON4 attended workshop in Luxembourg last year on topic.
 -PERSON6, PERSON7 planning internal workshop on available summarization models for Tuesday 11th of August.
 -PERSON5 ca not come as he will working from 1st of August , he ca not join.
 -PERSON6, PERSON7 will meet on 11th of August.
  assignment is to create summary of ehm of meeting, take notes on techniques use.
 -PERSON6 will send invite for call workshop on 11th of August.
 -PERSON3 will take notes from call, make summary of meeting.
 -PERSON6, PERSON7 going to make decision call for sharetask.
 -PERSON3 , PERSON7, PERSON5 trying to figure to download 600 megabytes of data from Internet.
  need measure to distinguish minutes from minutes of different meetings.
 -PERSON5, PERSON3 will switch to ORGANIZATION2 Meet.
 -Person3 will send them link to concrete data have.
 -PERSON3 will send texts , audio of meeting, summ summaries to PERSON5, PERSON7.
 -PERSON3 will share with them guidelines for annotating texts.
 -Person5 will use email instead of email.
 -Person7 will send request to Organization 1 PERSON7 is talking PROJECT2 ORGANIZATION1 PRO Project2 personals.
 -PERSON3 wants to know if can automatically find measure to distinguish minutes from different minutes meetings.
