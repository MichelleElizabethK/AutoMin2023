SUMMARY-
 -PERSON3 had a Organization12 call this morning, but it didn't work.
  The kids took all his electronic devices, so he left with his cellphone only.
  People who didn't have the experience with Organization12 calls last summer will be able to participate this time.
  Organizing7 wants to use it for the meeting summarization purposes.
  They want to process the data within the team.
  They will be anonymizing these calls, so they will be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholder names PERSON3, PERSON11, PERSON14 and PERSON3 are planning a demo event for the PROJECT5 project.
  They will use the next year's ORGANIZATION7 as their main demo event.
 -PERSON11 has been working on collecting monoli monolingual data for the PERSON11 is looking for an algorithm for mining parallel data in one hundred l languages.
  They have been looking at the data from PROJECT6.
  The trained models on their testing data are not much better than the best Edinburgh model, probably because they didn't train on spoken data.
 -PERSON3 wants PERSON11 and PERSON8 to help him with the evaluation of the PROJECT3 and PROJECT5 test set.
 -PERSON8 wants to run PROJECT2 on data for around one hour and make some minor changes.
  They want to make PROJECT5 a standard evaluation tool for spoken language translation and also for machine translation.
  They want to have the evaluation of the PROJECT2 on PROJECT5 test set as a demonstration paper for a conference in January.
 -PERSON3 wants to talk with PERSON8 and PERSON14 next week.
 -PERSON14 doesn't know what to work on and who to work with.
  They want to talk to PERSON10 separately and help him with the evaluation of all the systems running through PROJECT5 test set.
 -PERSON3, PERSON8, PERSON12, PERSON14, PERSON10 and possibly PERSON15 should have a separate technical call on the design of a censorship tool.
 -PERSON4 has worked on multitarget machine translation for his master thesis.
  Now he worked on PROJECT5 to develop multi source models.
  His task is to generate synthetic multisource train set.
  When he gets access to the system and the cluster, he will check it out.
 -PERSON10, PERSON3 and PERSON15 are waiting for their cluster.
 -PERSON7 worked on data augmentation for PROJECT4.
 -PERSON3's model is only for offline processing.
  If the model is good, it will be integrated into PROJECT5 test set.
  If it's not good, they will use the cascaded model from PERSON4's thesis.
 -PERSON7, PERSON15, and PERSON16 will PERSON3 will continue training on the multisource data.
 -PERSON10 suggests to transfer learning on on of double encoder model on small GPus.
 -PERSON3 is making PERSON7 the host of the call.
 -PERSON14 has to leave, her lecture is ongoing and she has already said her part.
 -PERSON7 worked on the same task as the ORGANIZATION14 challenge.
  The task was due on the 20th of September.
  The data set is partially nonnative, partially native and contains information about age and gender.
  The main objective of the Organization 4 Toolkit is to train a robust English PROJECT4.
 -PERSON 15 is still at home and doesn't have much time to work.
 -PERSON7 will probably be in Prague next week.
  They and PERSON15 need to check if they can use the data from the ORGANIZATION14 challenge.
 -PERSON15 wants PERSON7 to share the data set with her.
  They will leave a message for PERSON7 on mail.
