            "Yeah, okay, okay, okay.",
            "You have nice machines there.",
            "Yeah, I got it built on during the And it came one and half or two months ago actually. Yeah.",
            "Okay, it seems that I like I need to disconnect first, and then reconnect so, okay. I'll be here in few seconds.",
            "Uh, okay, okay.",
            "Hi good to see you.",
            "Hi, hi, hi PERSON12, how are you?",
            "So welcome",
            "But it was, uh, uh. So now I'm actually back to work and that actually improved my mood.",
            "Yeah, okay. And my holidays were also not kind of like that fun. As the New Year is king of expected of but filled more with assignments, projects, these kinds of stuff you know. But that was still fun stuff so you cannot complain.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So are you actually staying in Mannheim in the dorms or in uh, uh, uh.",
            "No, this is this is my private private apartment.",
            "And is it in Barbican city or is it the other side. There there was, uh, like",
            "you mean.",
            "yes.",
            "Yes so this is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "It is more like a kind of village kind of part of the city. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. So I see that PERSON5 is here and as well. So PERSON7 any news about your electricity or is it?",
            "Yes, it's back.",
            "It's back yeah. Yeah, it is, yeah. Uh, there is some, some noise cancellation. Uh, uh, uh, And so hopefully that will work out. Okay, so let's get started, because we want to, uh, cut this shortest uh, uh, so yeah. So we fit into the half hour and PERSON3 is hopefully answering. So, uh, my to dos. Or the items, that I want, to, bring up, uh, are the two sessions that we have. So one is PROJECT13 and the other is PROJECT6. So PROJECT13 is the Holocaust survivor's session And the PROJECT6 has been postponed by a month. So that gives us, uh, some extra time, which is, uh, which is good. Um, I've started documents with \"to do\" lists. This is is mainly on PERSON7. But I would like to ask anyone who could help. So PERSON13 you or you said that, you would be very busy and you could Uh, like, is there anything you can help with or, uh, or, uh.",
            "I, I would not make any like false promise like, make, a, promise now, and otherwise not do it. So I am, I'm like I will be quite honest because I'm like slumbered with the homework, the assignments and exams approaching. I'm on the technical calls regularly so I'm like up to date with what is like happening and who is doing what. So after a month when I get time I think I can get quickly to the project.",
            "Yeah, okay. So in case you had some extra time I suggest that you talk directly to PERSON7.",
            "Okay, I'm happy to do that.",
            "And ask if there is any like one shot of thing that you could do. Mm, it, it, could, be, any, data preparation, like, downloading for, uh, some, some, domain data you know, for the two, uh, events, or, or, something, like that. Mm, yeah. I'm happy to see PERSON14 here as well. Uh, so PERSON14 have you answered whether you would be available as a backup? Or, uh, I haven't asked you yet? Sorry, my fault. Uh, I'm I'm sending a question to PERSON14 now, so the the second event, the PROJECT6 will have two parts. One will be online, prerecorded. And that will be interleaved with a real live discussion, which will take place, in the PROJECT6. And, I'm, going to the PROJECT6 tomorrow. Uhm, for like technical meeting. So I will see where can we plug our bear ringers and actually record the sound, uh, um, on the, uh, on site.",
            "And I 'm just checking if PERSON14 would be available as a backup person in case of whatever I get sick, or something like that. For that is in February. It has been moved to the 26th of February. So we need. Yeah. .",
            "Yes, okay. I can do it.",
            "Yes, thanks. So, so I plan to do it myself. I plan to go there, but like, we need a backup person. And, uh, also for the PROJECT13 event. We need someone to take care of the recording, so the archiver person. So then we do not lose that session again. So this is, uh, these two things. And, like, the more important and still persisting topic to to work on is the ladder climbing and I've suggested here uh, in the uh, uh, in the uh, paragraph for PERSON7, uh, that we could use simple HTML tables that would be auto generated, and that would grow. And um, um, yeah, it could show that. So I think that that would be probably the easiest, uh, to just put up the tables as HTML. But it could get difficult when we want to see the differences as the perform. As like the like new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.",
            "It may be difficult to prepare these tables. So I asked PERSON3 and PERSON3 unfortunately won't be available during this call. Um, to to tell us whether the Weights and Biases, which is a web based solution. Some start up company which offers, uh, accounts for academic purposes for free, if that would help us are or not. Um, yeah, okay, so Weights and Biases this is not really, uh, recommended by PERSON3. And so so the simple HTML is probably the, uh, the way to go. So as soon as PERSON7 has these evaluations, um, cleaned up. So that means moving the few scripts to, uh, where they belong from PROJECT2 test set and some automatic runner. Then also, please create a conversion from the tables into HTML. Similarly to the tech conversion and then put these results, uh, uh, regularly to to your webpage. Or what you could even do, is to have a full, uh, Git check out, uh, directly located in this public HTML or simling from that public HTML.",
            "So that, um, it would be immediately accessible through the web. And anybody could could have a look at the current scoring, and and and like explore that. So this, this would be useful, especially for people outside of ORGANIZATION4 such as, ORGANIZATION10, uhm, we know they have like The performance was was bad for some of the files and they could directly, uh, browse it on the web. Uhm, they could also browse it actually in in on ORGANIZATION7. So if this is up to you to set it up so that it is like user friendly and and easy and easy to follow. .",
            "Okay, yeah, yeah, I'll do that.",
            "Yeah, thanks. So that is, um, myself. I'm now, uh, working on, uh, getting to update the, um, demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I 'm not mistaken. And then I have some project reports to do, and I'm starting to gather documents, ah, like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, uh, for the two sessions. Uh so there is the standard work. And then I'm pretty busy with minuting. Like not not doing anything myself, but just arranging what what people do. So this is my report. So please, uhm then proceed one by one and tell me. We have already heard from PERSON13 probably no progress over the Christmas. Yeah, that's that's fine like it is it is exam period. So, ah, so PERSON7. Uh, maybe if you could summarize your impressions from the finishing of the deliverables. Like, what is missing, and what is, um, uh, what, you, were, happy, about, and, what you were unhappy about, when doing D one point five and D six point three.",
            "I think of the one point five, uh. Okay, so we are just reporting. I mean, we are reporting the numbers of words, so, the statistics about the transcript percent, right? Oh yeah, it is a good metric, I would say to represent the numbers. But I would also say that, uh, we should also represent a language pairs. Like, uh,. let's say,",
            "Mhm, yeah.",
            "English to a German or English to Czech or vies versa, so that, um, ultimately we get, uh, enough. Originally we wanted to get an idea about, uh, the conversion, like the world ratio of two languages for a given transcript.",
            "Yeah",
            "That would also be helpful. Um. And then this would probably also, uh, help us in getting. So I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, uh, PROJECT3 and we want to remove it. Or we had to remove the empty lines, uh, due to profanity filtering. So we had to check it at the moment that, uh, whether to remove the.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So far. I'm not really sure.",
            "So what do you.",
            "I can't remember the word exactly.",
            "Yeah, uh, so let me let me take a record here, so, uh, PERSON7 will do this. And then, uh, as observations, uh, uh, of some D one point five empty, six point, uh, three preparation. So, uh, for, uh, uh, test set size. Uh, info we should at a statistic per, uh, uh, language pair. Uh, then, uh, for what was for was the second thing. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, so, for.",
            "Uh, for for PROJECT3 as well. Uh, We should add, uh, to complimentary metric, uh, actually it is more. We should add complementary met these complementary metric. Uh ,so, you mentioned one, and that is profanity filtering, uh, evaluation. Uh, so, uh, have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output, right?",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And then, uh, then, uh, rare words evaluation. Uh, and here have an explicit list of names and, uh, terms, uh, that we, uh, do want to appear in the output. Uh, scored, uh, not simply by word error rate but, scored by something which directly accounts, uh, these things, right? Yes, so I I totally agree. Uh, this involves also manual preparation of the reference, so, hm, both need manual, uh, manually created references. I have one remark from from PERSON9. So, PERSON2 has compiled, uh, some, uh, uh, translation dictionary, um, and, uh, uh, should. She should share it soon. So this could become an PROJECT9 part of the second thing of the railroad. Uh, so this would be the rare, uh, words, uh, eval for PROJECT9 and then from PROJECT13 we are also likely to get some dictionary. Uh, so that will be PROJECT13 domain obviously? And PERSON7 could I ask you to to revise the PROJECT1 domain and creates such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.",
            "So like short listing, uh, listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the PROJECT1 domain. Could you do that?.",
            "I think I still have to make a call with, uh, PERSON10. So we haven't had a call yet. So probably I will have one call with him next Monday.",
            "Mhm. And then, you know, I I can also look at it.",
            "Yeah, so you are. You are afraid you are busy. You, uh, uh, probably, can 't get get to it soon.",
            "Actually. No, I mean Not before Monday. Because tomorrow I have my test.",
            "Uh, so, let's, uh, well. Next week, uh, consider if PERSON7 would have the capacity to extract. Or we could also ask PERSON1, uh, not PERSON10, but, PERSON1, uh, uh, to extract uh, this positive plus negative lists from PROJECT1 or domain documents. So that would be the various PROJECT8, uh, uh, uh, things.",
            "Uh, there was one more thing.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So basically, it has to do with the scores that we are calculating.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So, uh, I think we need to improve our segmenter, the worlds are getting revised fine. If, uh, we improve our segmenters our score should be higher than what we are getting.",
            "Mhm, okay, so, uh, the, uh, segmenter or well, it is a problem. Um, yeah. If we improve that, yeah, uh, well, it would be much better. Okay, uh, so uh, what I miss still, and what should belong to the ladder climbing and the regular reports is PROJECT10 style of evaluation. So we will, uh, talk about this at the latest next Wednesday with partners. Uh, whether we are happy with the way of delay is being calculated. So, PERSON7 could you get us, uh, also some of the delay scores? So maybe, start with a single document. Do not do it for all of them yet. But, uh, get in touch with PERSON1 and get some delay scores for some of the files from the PROJECT2 test set. Probably from the IWPROJECT10 Dev set, uh, the, the, the Portuguese or whatever, uh, domain. So, segmenter is related tom this a lot, so that's why it occurred to me that we need that.",
            "So, uh, PERSON7 please prepare for, uh, for the, uh, Wednesday call with, uh, like, uh, other partners by, uh, getting PROJECT10 scores delay plus PROJECT7, uh, on one of the IWPROJECT10 Dev, uh, files or uh other, uh, PROJECT1 domain files. So again, with the help of PERSON1, ask him right now how to get it. The plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it just for one file. And and see, what what we get there?.",
            "Okay, sure. I'll first ask him to, uh, correct po the current PROJECT10L for the correct type we have. So the correct one is not working. I had to come almost come from the back from it.",
            "Yeah, yeah, sure.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "Okay.",
            "Mhm yeah, okay. Thank you. So yeah, I should mention that loud, that like, uh, PERSON7, has done tremendous amount of work, uh, for the deliverable. Uh, it was towards the end of the year. Luckily, he doesn't celebrate Christmas. So it was not a spoiled Christmas break for any, any European person. It would be as spoiled Christmas. So, uh, uh, they. in the end, I'm I'm happy with the tables that we put into the deliverables. But this is something which I have been asking for since August already. So you see, that like, it's is despite, it seems simple, it actually takes time, and we need to work this way. And I, uh, for the continuous, uh evaluation, for the ladder climbing I really do want to have tha, uh, uh, um, these observations being gathered like throughout the weeks and not for the deadline. Because, then you you see how stressful it was to to to get, uh, all the things together.",
            "So, uh, so let's, uh, that is for everybody. Let us keep in mind that evaluation is something which takes time. And uh, uh, like the presentation of that is also important, and we need to do it way before the deadline is approaching. So hopefully we will be more likely with, uh, like, time allocation for this, and and hopefully it will be less, uh, stressful. For both of the sessions, PROJECT13 and PROJECT6 I do already want to choose the system the the pipeline from some choices, and this has to be based on some numbers. So we haven't done that before. We have always used just some of the system and and not really thought about which one, but let's really start making an informed choice. .",
            "Oh yes. So, uh, PROJECT13 is going to be in Czech, right? Uh, yes, if I'm not mistaken. It is in Czech, right? So that actually. Yeah.",
            "You will need to be in touch with PERSON10, as you said, uh, because we need to revive, uh, the PROJECT5. And PERSON5 is trying to get PROJECT5 running for himself as well. But I 'm not sure how far he is so like, I believe.",
            "Well, uh, I finally, I finally managed to compile it.",
            "Well it was some fix I found on the internet. It was just some flag for linking. So it wasn't that bad, actually. And now I 'm trying to, uh, train the a model on common voice. And I was thinking that maybe I should revise which the data set. I will be actually using for the for the experiment.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Because of most papers, uh, actually, they are not using a common voice. So maybe maybe it is better to use some other data set. But on the other hand, um, benefit of the common voice is that we have additional information about gender and speakers. And there are also non native speakers there, many, non native speakers, mostly Indians and so on. So the question is, uh, which data set we want to use, or whether we want to use more datasets.",
            "More datasets. My answers is definitely more datasets. So I suggest that you choose what. Well, uh, there is an email that I send already before Christmas. to PERSON17 and PERSON15 so to the ORGANIZATION10 people asking about links to the data, and they still didn't respond. I sent them a reminder yesterday. If you have seen that as well, so hopefully they will respond. And I suggest that you use all they suggest, all they recommend. And, uh, also common voice. Because we really need to. So the the goal is to have the baseline, and then to do the, uh, uh, the word uh, cutting thing. Uh, but I think that already this baseline should be geared towards non native speakers. So that's why I'd definitely like the common voice to be in there. But at the same time, I'm, I'm pretty sure the common voice alone would be too small.",
            "It would not be good, uh, it would be good for comparison purposes, but it would not be good as a system for deployment. .",
            "Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. As for the system day, it it it is clear that when it is all the data since we have available. But I was thinking rather about some paper from one that might stem from from this experiment. And for that, it might be actually better to use some, uh, more frequently used the dataset, for example, ORGANIZATION2, or maybe ORGANIZATION3.",
            "Yeah. So, uh, whatever you can get easily and easily converted to the appropriate format. Please combine all that together. And, uh, so when I said that PERSON8 is owing us the list of PROJECT4 data and other links, they actually have already provided these, uh, links in some way. Uh, uh, to deliverables in the work package one. So, uh, these references are already available to some extent. And and now I do not know which is if it is D one point. Uh, let me check PROJECT2 You, deliverables, D one one and D one five. So, D one one and D one five. So, uh, the one one is, uh, publicly available. D one five. I'm sure you have that in your overleaf PERSON5.",
            "Where can I find it, exactly?",
            "So I have",
            "So I have overleaf open. So it's. So which document it is.",
            "So I 'm now, I'm now in the the search organization document. The one where we had the link. Uh, uh, for this call.",
            "Okay, I will open it.",
            "D one five.",
            "D six three.",
            "No, D one five. So I 've just pasted the link, uh, to the ORGANIZATION11 doc as well. So D one five is this one, yah, and D one one is is already published. So please browse these, there is an PROJECT3 section. And you are the one. You are actually the only one who is training PROJECT3 system, uh, at ORGANIZATION4 these days. So you should, uh, like clean or make yourself familiar with the data on our disks and put it there. So net data, and not necessarily within PROJECT2. It can be also outside of PROJECT2 it can be like you have the directory. You know, the directory where to where to put these things.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the PROJECT2 data.",
            "Yah, okay.",
            "Sorry to interrupt. I I was also thinking I would like to get in touch. I to work with PERSON5 on PROJECT5 PROJECT3 actually. Uh, I'm also thinking to do some non native speech, uh.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Uh, like, in building a non native speech, uh, automated system, for tor some languages, as a part of my, as a part of the masters thesis.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So I mean, I think the sooner I get started working on it the sooner I will be able to I, I will be able to build the Uh, I I do not know, because I haven't done this in the past. So",
            "Yeah. So is there still any benefit in uh talking to PERSON10 for the two of you PERSON13 and PERSON5? Because PERSON7 will have a call with PERSON10. So should you join that as well? So that you, like, PERSON10 has already written, like, understood some of the traces that PERSON11 left for us. So he was able to run the system, at least. And now PERSON10 has left. So we need , we need to make sure it is stored. That the knowledge is stored with someone in the team, it can be PERSON7, but it also could be PERSON13 and PERSON5.",
            "So, what I was thinking, that I should first view the video which PERSON11 had, recorded, before he left. So, once, uh, once, I, I, I, go through that, then I think, uh, me a PERSON5 can decide on when to have a call, uh, with PERSON10.",
            "Yeah. I'm two part of the of the video, or from the beginning. And um, I If I'm not mistaken that some of the paths are not existing yet. So, some things were removed, so I don't know whether we can run everything which is in in the video.  So maybe it it will be better for us to to attend the call with the PERSON10. So then we are with the most uptodate version of our remote",
            "Yeah, said the sounds. That, that actually sounds best",
            "And then we can. And then we can have call together. So because I m actually also like to work on the non native speakers so of it is actually, uh, uh, one part of my, uh, uh, of my thesis. So. Uh, but if I understand it correctly you you would like to do this model using PROJECT5",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay. Because that would be great because I 'm more fan of the of the, you know, models. So we can actually compare its performance. So that would be great to cooperate on this thing.",
            "Yeah, probably that would also uh, ease the distribution of PROJECT2 project.",
            "Okay, so uh, the call with, PERSON10, uh, should continue right after this call.",
            "So, PERSON7, when is your call.",
            "No, I will probably talk to him on Monday. That is why I'll drop send him an email today. But PERSON10 is busy and not available on Friday, so it will be probably on Monday or Tuesday.",
            "Okay, uh, PERSON7. So, uh, so please include me with the mail so I can add it to my calendar. Yeah sure, I'll I'll do and PERSON13. And probably PERSON13, PERSON13.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Great, okay. Great, so I'm happy that we have not missed this. Uh, this opportunity for sunchro, uh, for a synch. Okay, uh, thanks. So let's quickly move to PERSON14. Uh, unless there is anything very important PERSON5 uh still needs to say. Uh, no, no, I think I don't have anything.",
            "Yeah, about the call with PERSON10. Actually I wanna ask, so, uh, when do you finalise for the replacement for PERSON10. so me, the others and PERSON13 already know. Or if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that essentially he will also be training PROJECT3 systems if he is to replace PERSON10.",
            "Uh, uh, yes, you're talking about the what is his name. Sorry, I have missed that.",
            "Uh, uh, PERSON4.",
            "Vi, PERSON4.",
            "There was Yes.",
            "Vi, PERSON4, yeah, yeah, yeah. I I I need to, uh, respond to that. That's my fault, it's on my \" to do\" list.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thanks. And PERSON14, you have the summary. So please present it.",
            "Yes.",
            "And you are just missing one more thing. And that is the language, oh yes, it's there, yes.",
            "It's there. So before Christmas, I released the PROJECT11 corpus for PERSON3. And this, uh, this week, I implemented or or trained speech language identification. I have a model for Czech, German and English which kind of works on YouTube videos in Euro parliament. And I tried on PERSON6 speaking her German accented English, and it worked. It in works in online mode, with three seconds delay, and I 'm going to integrate it into the mediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it. And then I'm going to pass it to PERSON13 or anyone who can train other model the same way as me. Because maybe we need five languages of ORGANIZATION9 or anything else. And then I'm going to analyze the ASI dev data and then probably PROJECT12 training or anything else.",
            "That, the PROJECT12 that will be with PERSON3. And one topic is missing. And that is the, uh, study. Subtitler study where we are aiming for the end of the month deadline, right? Are we?",
            "Yes, probably.",
            "It should be doable. So let's. Let's give it a try, it. It would be like. It would be great if we managed to to do that. So I will write it down. So um, aiming, uh, towards ORGANIZATION8 deadline with a subtitler study paper, uh, yes, uh, and then, uh, then PROJECT12. Uh, with PERSON3 or based upon PERSON3. And for the language ID I'm curious, how do you want to integrate it exactly. Because it already involves considering multiple PROJECT3 sources, multiple channels. So, uh, what would be the use case for, uh, for the language idea. How do we plug that in? Do we plug it as.",
            "It will, it will be as audio to text worker",
            "Mhm.",
            "And it will emit time stamps like .",
            "Mhm.",
            "For for a two second window. And and and class, you can see the silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it, in, the, pipeline.",
            "That, is, that, is important. Please write this down here in the document, this briefing summary. Uh, because, uh, that is, uh, PERSON7, and also PERSON7, when you talk to PERSON16 a well and also possibly PERSON13. Uh, if we have this tool, we need to ship the audio, uh, to multiple, um, uh, PROJECT3, uh, or, multiple, uh, workers, in, the, directory. We will separately need to ship the audio to the English PROJECT3 separately. , To the German PROJECT3 and the Czech PROJECT3 for example. Depending on the. And also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs. And this is the tool which we do not have yet. That's the PROJECT12 tool, which will be preserving these text outputs and also following the time stamps. Uh, and it would emit, uh, it would probably like produce uh, separate the output into the three language channels.",
            "Producing either silent or correct PROJECT3. So we need like, uh, filters for the PROJECT3s so the PROJECT3 is silent if' it's the wrong language and it, uh, it, it is the recognized text if it is the correct language. So we need to figure out. So this is just one. Like I just made it up, this this type of setup. Another set up would be that, the same sound is shipped to PROJECT3 and this language checker and, uh, that already, like this language checker is essentially a a part of the PROJECT3 silencing the PROJECT3 if it is the wrong language. That is also an an option. So, we need to figure out, which way, um, uh, is of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes. So, please keep thinking about, uh, this, uh, like what are our pipelines. Ideally, uh, uh, I think that uh, the, the, least, uh, like, management, confusion, and, and, so on would arise if our PROJECT9 models were multilingual.",
            "If it supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input. Ah, so, we would have this multi langue multilingual, multiple PROJECT3 at the beginning all going into English and then from the English would go into all of the languages. And later, when PERSON5 would have a multilingual model of PROJECT3, uh, that language ID would not even be needed. So this is,uh, like, we, need to, uh, figure out, uh. building blocks. Yeah, so. So, like, please think about if, uh, for a while. You have seen the sessions, you know what can happen. Uh, and, uh, I think that we should have multi lingual, uh, PROJECT9 models and either multi lingual PROJECT3 or multiple PROJECT3 with this language ID all feeding into the same multi lingual PROJECT9 and then this PROJECT9 producing English.",
            "And then from English, will go to all the, uh, of the other languages. Does that make sense?.",
            "Um, I mean it kind of does, but it will like bias the translations. So.  I mean, the quality is probably going to the deteriorate.  Given the time",
            "Yeah, not necessary for the for the multilingual models. It's a, it's, um. If it is a PROJECT12 Uh, it is should. Like it's. Uh, it is not. It's not PROJECT12, uh, by having multiple concurrent inputs. It's multi, just, multilingual. Uh, I don't think, it, should deteriorate too much if it's if it's, uh, three languages, uh, at the, uh at the beginning. And we don't have.",
            "I think If I think ORGANIZATION11 or ORGANIZATION1 has done something like this. And they do not have an intermediate language. So it is direct from one language to another. Initially it was from the initial language to English and then to another language. But now they have another tool, which is essentially from one language to another language. It doesn't involve getting english in between. And, uh, it proved to be more efficient than, uh, putting English in between. So, English, as the intermediatory language. So, uh, I mean to interpret Or they talked about how the computer had learned to try, or to interprete Or it created one language on it's own. Starter  So I understand too. It was early German and Spanish.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So the machine was translating Spanish to something which only it knows and no one else. And there was converting it to German. So there was them. They were obviously a intermediate language, but that language was not, uh, manually annotated. So, uh, it is someone who knows, uh, Czech. And no, who knows Spanish and, uh, German both. So, he or she can directly translate from one language to another, withour using English as a derivatory language.",
            "Well, if if you could find a reference to, this. Please, uh, let me know. But, uh, so far what you said, it seems to me, it is like, uh, the general statement. That direct bilingual models are better, uh, than models, uh, than, output, that are pivoted. And I do not think that, this, is, uh, an, ultimately, uh, true statement. I think it very much depends on the data available. If you have good data for the language pair, then yes, it is better to go directly. But if your data is more available through English then it's it's better to go through English or synthetise the uh the data for the direct language pair. And that's probably the best quality you can get. That you create synthetic corpora, uh, based on English centric data set but you create then a direct model.",
            "Uh, so, it it was not necessarily a bilingual, it it was a multi lingual model.",
            "It was multi lingual. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, the input could be multi lingual as well as the output would be multi lingual. So I mean that's why it was interesting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I will try to find it and send it to you.",
            "Yeah, okay, thank you. Uh, so thanks, uh, PERSON14, for, uh, the write up. Yes, the the book, uh, we definitely have to have it out, in uh uh. In, the middle of the year so, uh, probably we should start meeting on that and start, uh, writing, uh, right after the subtitler study is, is a way.",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Okay. So I think that is it for the call today. I'll try to record somewhat my suggestion about how to use the language ID in theirs that we have in the document, and otherwise, uh, uh, uh, uh, have a good week and talk to you, uh, next, uh, Thursday, and be in touch, uh, with, uh, the preparations for the for the events so that is, uh and the continuous evaluation. That is the, the ladder climbing is the most urgent thing now. Okay, so thanks a lot. Thank you.",
            "Thank you. Bye.",
            "Bye bye.",

            "Hi PERSON2.",
            "Okay, it works.",
            "Yes, it works.",
            "Hello Hello.",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah, sorry, for the delay and sorry for the complications. I had a ORGANIZATION12 call  this morning with this cell phone, and it worked. Eeeh and I don´t know, why it doesn´t work at the moment. Eh I´m on  eh  Yeah, sorry. So I´m I´m I´m back. It´s The kids have taken all my eh, all my computers and I left with eh, with the cellphone only. Eh, so I can not share the the the ORGANIZATION2 doc eh, eh But Well, I hope that everybody's looking at the ORGANIZATION2 doc. And thanks to all who joined, um, so to explain to especially PERSON15and PERSON10 who didn´t And maybe PERSON7, eh, who didn´t have the experience with these calls last eh s summer. Uh. The goal is to synchronize the group, and the date and time eh, the so the day and time of the week is chosen, uh, so that it is fits to most of us.",
            "Eh, and we if we see that the uh, the the participation is is eh, falling down, because people´s schedules changed. Then we will run, or we will update that call again and we´ll choose maybe a different slot. And eh, those who cannot attend eh, for a particular week, that´s not a problem at all. Like if if randomly you can not attend, no worries, eh, instead of excusing yourself just enter your details in the shared document before the call. And that´s it. That serves as an excuse already. Eh, so, eh, otherwise these calls are very important, especially to reconnect with people eh, that, eh ere somewhat eh, like stranded alone for a longer while. So one of those is PERSON11, for example, eh, so eh I would later ask PERSON11 to eh, to to give us a brief summary of what he he has been working on for the past months actually.",
            "And what he is is he up to. And eh, there will be a lot of connection with eh, lot of connections with everything what he do. And one more eh, comment from myself. Eh, this call is being recorded, I hope you don´t mind. Uh, and eh, we are eh, hoping that that will be allowed by you have to use these calls for the meeting summarization eh, eh, so eh, the Fe if you agree now, like please keep participating in the call, and the consent that you are giving by your participation now is not to publish the data yet. It´s only consent to process the data within the team. So we will be processing the data. We´ll be anonymizing these calls, so we´ll be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholders and so. And then once the data is anonymized or pseudonymized so, it´s like full anonymization is actually not possible.",
            "Because you could be always identified by your background. But eh, eh, but the text will not contain any clear links to you. So it would be eh, pseudonymized. After this we´ll ask you again eh, to give us a permission to uh, to use this in the uh, for the sum meeting summarization purposes. Eh, so Yeah. That that´s about recording. And and the uh, the the warning that I have to say before we go into the individual ehm, individual report is that eh, there is the ORGANIZATION7 conference. Eh, I think it´s early December. So less than month from now, and we should eh, get ready for that, because eh, this ORGANIZATION7 conference will serve as a test eh, event for us. Eh, we should be as prepared as we would be for the main ORGANIZATION16 Congress. Eh, and this year we have eh, asked ORGANIZATION7 to only allow us to connect to their I think it would be ORGANIZATION12 eh, oh, eh ORGANIZATION12 to only connect and show the the subtitle somewhere on the side, quite silently without much publicity.",
            "And if the ORGANIZATION16 Congress is actually not happening. Then we will use the next year's ORGANIZATION7 as our main eh, demo event for for the PROJECT5 project. So it is an important exercise. It will be with limited or no audience this year, probably. Uh, but it´s at least like sympathetic audience. I´s all MLT researchers. So they will understand what what are the problems of the technology. But we need to get ready for that, because it´s is a serious demo. So ehm, so eh, well w we´ll be working Everyone of you will be working somehow to uh, to help with this as you are working that anyway. Eh, okay, so that´s enough from me. Eh, and I would like now eh, I would like to ask PERSON11 now to start, because he has been the most eh, eh remote  for a while. .",
            "Hm, hello. Can you hear me, see me?",
            "Yes. Yes, I don´t see you, but",
            "Okay. Eeeh.",
            "I could see you.",
            "That´s a problem.",
            "Yes, so  Actually I don´t know what was the last time when I was eh, on this call. But so eh The first thing actually that that I have been working since on this calls was the paraphrasing. Which is that I I was using the rainbow model for for paraphrasing for, for PERSON1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Eh, and the then since then I haven´t actually been working on so much. But there have been some things since I didn´t have really uh, so many instructions. So one thing that that, I have been working on is, uh, is actually actually trying to collect the data that we can use The monoli monolingual data tha that we can use eh, for for this rainbow models. And for this I have actually found I have I have a Because like the problem is that that we need the domain specific data and",
            "Mhm.",
            "I have  So, I have been thinking that that well Eh, so so so at first, I tried eh, actually filtering eh, so some some other data sets that already exists. Such as Such as common crawl and so on. But I found that that it is actually quite a problem to to find spoken data there. Since it´s Usually web pages. So, so what I thought is that I would eeh I would go over some, eh, some more pages, wer where there are actually some videos, and to download transcripts from there. And so for this, I tried eh, to go to ORGANIZATION10. And I actually di discovered that that you can scrape eh, subtitles from from these these, uh, courses, Eh, w which are actually in eh, like multiple languages. So so so",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this way I I obtained eh  Yes, so so in the free version there are some limitations. So I only obtained to scrape a small data set like one hundred thousand sentences, which could like be used for testing. But still, it´s something and and and otherwise I I didn´t find out any",
            "Mhm.",
            "Any other ideas so  So any s any suggestions would wo would be welcome.",
            "The ORGANIZATION6. ORGANIZATION6corpus.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yo are you in touch with PERSON13?",
            "Yes, so eh, so I received the e mail from him. And I didn´t look at it yet. Eeeh.",
            "Aha. Please do it.  So So yes.",
            "Yeah. So this would be an parallel corpus. Yes, so Yes, so I have to get in touch with him. But I had a a lot of to do to do in in the past week. So I kind of didn´t eh",
            "Yeah.",
            "Didn´t continue with this. So I I will write to him as soon as possible. And also what I have actually discovered is that ORGANIZATION2 It´s not ORGANIZATION2 sorry, ORGANIZATION15.",
            "ORGANIZATION15.",
            "Actually",
            "They release some data.",
            "They released a data and a model. So so what they released is eh So first what they released is actually an algorithm for mining parallel data in one hundred l languages.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Not Englishcentric. But actually between all of those uh, English languages. And only I don´t know one third of it is Englishcentric.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So I I have been looking at this, and they they have also released  Basically they haven´t released the data yet, I think, but they have also released the the trained models. And I have I have been evaluating that trained models on our testing data.",
            "Mhm",
            "And the the models are really huge. It´s like sixteen billion parameters.",
            "Uhm hm",
            "But actually, actually, I have discovered that on some, uh, on some of our testing data sets from PROJECT6. They are actually not much better than Even not better than than the best Edinburgh model. Probably probably because they didn´t train on o o on spoken data. A and also like like they they are very tricky to run, because you need like for GPUs with sixteen gigabytes of RAM at least. And it takes like up to a minutes to translate just one hundred sentences. So for us they are quite useless and What would pro probably be the most useful is is actually the data. So that we can eh, use it to to So can you So that we can adapt adapt their data collection, eh, for for some kind of spoken data. Otherwise it didn´t really wo works works so much better. Which quite quite suprised me.",
            "But but maybe eh, on on testing data in in other low research languages it will be better. I  don´t know, just.",
            "Yeah. Can you hear me it?",
            "Yes.",
            "Does it work at all? Eh, yes. You can hear me right. So this is eh, that is a long report and lot of work planned and lot of work done. So the evaluation So I would like to highlight the the high level thing, eh So we need monolingual data for eh, domain adaptation. So in the domain to create synthetic data, based on that, we need parallel data as much as possible. And there please get in touch, and really continue and finish the ORGANIZATION6corpus that was started",
            "Uhm hm.",
            "PERSON13 last year already, and we never got to finish that. And these huge models, that´s excellent. Eh, the idea that I have there is that we could use them for eh, teacher student. Eh, so we could distill smaller model from that.",
            "Uhm, yeah.",
            "So that",
            "This could totally work.",
            "Yeah, so that is something that we should,eh, we should consider this like next the possible thing to do.",
            "Uhm hm.",
            "And the evaluation is more important. So with the evaluation I would like you to em, test the evaluation eh, using PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT3 and in on the call I saw Now it doesn´t really work for me the ORGANIZATION12 is kind of stuck. But we have PERSON8 here eh, and he is overseeing the development of the PROJECT3. And eh, we have eh, so Who is now responsible most for eh for the PROJECT5 test set. It used to be PERSON9, but eh, he is giving that to Is that you PERSON15, is that you? Or are we kind of eh, in in a post phase with the PROJECT5test set.",
            "I don´t know.",
            "You´re not on that. Okay. So that is kind of in the eh, in like like hanging in the air. Because PERSON9 is moving more towards system integration. And eh, PERSON6 who has worked on the PROJECT5test set will join us only from December. Eh will rejoin us. Because he is busy with other things. Eeh, but the PROJECT5 test set is there and eeh, s so maybe if eh, PERSON8 can briefly summarize the status of the PROJECT2. And the connection to PROJECT5 test set.",
            "And maybe if someone could send me the    Actually the status of  of the test set or some links or something.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Ok, so hi everbody. About PROJECT2 PROJECT5 test set. Eh, I think the current version of First of all PERSON12 wanted to attend the call but he had problem with ORGANIZATION5 so he wrote his report there. And I will speak on behalf of him also. There So the PROJECT5 eh, the PROJECT2 is completely finished. And as I said you PERSON3, it´s now workig wi For example, it´s working eh with alignment by I mean if they are inside in PROJECT5 test set.",
            "Mhm, okay.",
            "And we created one eh, index, new index, if you see, I put the name of the next inside the call, inside the, you know, ORGANIZATION2 doc. Eh, I think front of my name I wrote if I remember. Okay so if you see, we created a new index. The name is ORGANIZATION6 for PROJECT2. And also only that files are created in another documents. It´s eh, independent from the others. So I commited it in the PROJECT5 test set. And just I wanted to wanted to ask you, if you have just you know free time, for around one hour. We can run PROJECT2 on data and see the result and eh, you know, make the final agreement if you want to do some minor changes. I can do it. And then it´s ready and we can you know publish it.",
            "Deploy  Publish it, yeah. So the Yeah, so the For everybody, the general idea behind this PROJECT5 test set and PROJECT2 is that we would like to make it the standard evaluation tool. Not just for us, and not just for the PROJECT5 project, but also for others doing a spoken language translation. And the PROJECT5 test set contains the input texts and references and also input sounds and reference transcripts. Eh th so eh, well look up that ORGANIZATION9 hub repository and eh, PROJECT2 eh is the tool, which uses eh It can use any other inputs and references eh, but it is also directly capable capable downloading what eh, files you want to evaluate on from PROJECT5 test set. Similarly ORGANIZATION17 eh, is is like now the standard for WMT evaluation of Blair and other scores. So we would like to do this for eh, the spoken language translation eh, and also including machine translation, because its broader domain.",
            "Eh, broader range of domains than what the S, eh what the ORGANIZATION17 has. So everybody who is evaluating something and that is PERSON11 with the ORGANIZATION15 models PERSON11 with eh, your previous eh, multilingual models, um, uh. Then PERSON4 with his  multilingual model that he is going to develop. Then PROJECT5 with all the the pipeline. And I'm happy also to see Sa PERSON14 here on the on the call. So PERSON14 can help with that eh, to So PERSON10 and PERSON14 to evaluate all the workers that are in the PROJECT5 pipeline. All that should go through PROJECT5 eh, be evaluated through PROJECT5 eh, test set using PROJECT2. So please, everybody get in touch with PERSON8 directly, and get it s Like eh, like find a way in which this tool will work for all of you. Eh and the mhm eh, so Now we´re doing this like stress test within the consortium.",
            "And what PERSON8 was talking about that is the plan to publish it finally at eh, at a conference. So we have already sent it once. And it was eh, like not quite finished. And we sent it for the second time, and it is also not quite finished. So uh, we have uh, another chance in January as a demo paper. Uh, so for that, we would really like to have it eh, very nicely commented in a paper. Eh, documented in a paper, and we also want to include some real evaluation in that paper to show that it is useful. And eh, PERSON8 for this moment, selected the ORGANIZATION6 eh, data. Ah, so that would be like the test case of the evaluation for the purposes of the publication of the PROJECT2. But if any of your, uh, evaluations would uh, would be like more interesting than we could switch to this other use case, so that´s In any case this is a a big request from me.",
            "Everybody who are eh, evaluating any systems, please make sure to evaluate them using PROJECT2 on PROJECT5test set. There will be bugs. There will be like strange results. But this is exactly what we want to go through. We want to fix these bugs and we want to eh, get numbers and repeated measurements so that the number stabilize, and we and we trust that. And also PERSON5 So you could also evaluate your PROJECT4 systems on PROJECT2. .",
            "Yes, it´s possible, because it´s set as PROJECT4, but PERSON3,in the current version, because I disabled there you know what´s the name   Eh, it works offline. But only with the files inside the PROJECT5 test set.",
            "Yes",
            "But you  Okay, but you you want the previous version also, because you said in your you know when we were talking You said when you were talking you said",
            "Yes.",
            "Do you prefer to have both of them?",
            "Eh, so I think it should be the same tool, and it should try to connect to the ORGANIZATION5and download it. Download the PROJECT5 test set when you ask for that. So it should be",
            "When we ask for theth.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. It´s the same way",
            "It´s a same way as ORGANIZATION17. ORGANIZATION17 also works like independently or you can ask it to provide",
            "Okay. small changes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, I see. Okay, so the the main question. Could you please check Because I arrived and I´m in Czech and I´m working on my things. But whenever you have time, I prefer to talk with you around half an hour to an hour to finalize it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I prefer next week is very  To today I I 'm  co I'm coming to university. I I will come ORGANIZATION3, I will if you are in ORGANIZATION3  I will go to ORGANIZATION3. But eh, I think next week is very suitable for me, whenever you have time",
            "Yeah. Next week will be better.",
            "Yes.",
            "for me as well.",
            "Okay, so let me",
            "Yeah, great.",
            "Eh, okay. And about the paper also as you remember I put some fears there and I´m waiting  for your feedback.",
            "Mhm. Yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "I thank you  Okay. So maybe next week, when, we see we can finalize everything",
            "Yeah, okay. Great. Yeah. So now, there is eh many of you and we have only eight minutes left",
            "Okay.",
            "I would really like to keep these calls short. So who is the most lost? Please  Who who doesn´t know what to work on. Who is most like who feels most disconnected from the eh, from the goal of Yeah.",
            "Yes, so I´m like completely lost here, because o one of my lectures is scheduled so I´m attending lecture as well as the the meeting. So I have been looking here and there. Quite many times. So",
            "Yeah.",
            "So yeah. At the moment I don´t know what I should work on, and eh, who With whom I should eh, maybe",
            "Yeah, so",
            "Work with So yeah I I´d be really happy if you just",
            "Yeah. So please talk directly to PERSON10, and help PERSON10 with all what what he is lost in. And the most urgent thing to do is getting the evaluation of the of all the systems, of all the components from the eh, mediator, all the connected workers, running through PROJECT5 test set. So we need this this cruise control. The true regular evaluation of all the systems. This is the most urgent thing. Uh, and this is what what PERSON10is now also working on.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So please talk  You you don´t have to So eh, that´s like this these conflicts with like regular lectures eh, eh, let´s eh Your lecture has a p has a priority higher priority than this call. So ehm, ehm, like we will try to accommodate to that eh, by maybe js a searching for new slot later on. Or simply having you represented only through your notes. So it´not eh, eh I don´t want you to skip any of your school duties and that implies to everybody of course.",
            "Yes.. Uhm",
            "So please get in touch with PERSON10 separately",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And eh, the urgent most thing indeed",
            "Just  Yeah.",
            "Mhm. Ebrahim, okay?",
            "I´m sorry because just PERSON12 asked me to ask you about the censorship pipeline and because he is waiting for it",
            "Mhm. Yes, yes.",
            "And if you if you have any answer for him I can tell him or you you can send email about it later.",
            "Yes. So that´s that´s another topic that is very much linked toward eh PERSON4 is like uh, putting together, and also what eh, eh what PERSON9 would be kind of doing. But eh, eh, the censorship component is something which we want to have as a one part of the pipeline after the PROJECT4. And also another one, after the machine translation. And the goal of this censorship tool is to allow to immediately hide the outputs and then show them again. So there has to be some hidden user interface in which the eh, the operator of the system  checks what are the current outputs. And he reenables those or he can also manually switch it off, when the automatic eh, trigger didn´t fire. When when it didn´ t see anything bad, but there was something bad. So it´s like It´s not really editing of the life outputs, it´s just disabling of the outputs eh, for a moment.",
            "And um, uh so I thing that the best eh, sorry because as you see, I'm unable to respond in time. So the best thing would be if if PERSON12, PERSON14, PERSON10and perhaps PERSON15 as well had a separate technical call on the design of this. and that PERSON12 implemented that tool, right?.",
            "It´s good. I think it´s the best idea. So if San PERSON14could you hear me?",
            "Yeah. I can hear you.",
            "Okay, so if it is possible please contact PERSON12 and ask him for this call and if you want I can also attend the the call to",
            "Yeah.",
            "just and for example to",
            "Yeah. And and from the management point of view, PERSON14 and PERSON10 should be the two kind of replaceable persons. Because PERSON10 is taking over what PERSON14 did. PERSON14 has limited capacity. So PERSON10 and PERSON14 are technically the same person there. They just are",
            "Okay.",
            "On totally different places different places on the Earth, but you know  But that´s that´s okay. Okay.",
            "Okay. So you said PERSON14, PERSON10, PERSON12 and?",
            "Eh, maybe PERSON15.",
            "Okay, PERSON15, PERSON15.",
            "Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "Thank you. So then is the uh, the second next lost person?",
            "Hello.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, okay, great. Hi PERSON4. So to to to give everybody brief summary. PERSON4 has worked on multitarget machine translation for his master thesis. Which has been successfully defended in eh, in the starting the summer. And eh, now he eh, is also partly parttime employed on PROJECT5 to develop multi source eh, models. To to find up the the set up. And was there any other eh, type of model that we wanted you to train, or was it just this one?",
            "Currently we wanted to eh, abandon the multitarget set up and to eh, concentrate as as you assume multi source set up. And so far I only reselected some experiments on that suspect cluster and only have just just for the ORGANIZATION3 cluster access.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So n not very much of progress so far. I have asked eh My task were so far to generate synthetic multisource train set. And for this purpose, I asked PERSON11 for model and he sent me the",
            "Great.",
            "The place where it is.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But when I will receive the cluster access I will check this out.",
            "Yeh,so they should happen soon. I´m I´m sorry bu it´s a",
            "Yeah.",
            "It´s just that still the paperwork is still in the process.",
            "Ah, it´s still in the process. Okay, because I written there considering it is probably already okay to write them. So",
            "Yeah, I´ll I´ll double check eh, today, if if if it´s already processed enough.",
            "Yeah, but just in case that",
            "Somebody",
            "To have access to the system and cluster so I can do something what I can do there.",
            "Okay. How many GPUs can you run at one, at once?",
            "It´s two GPUs per machine.",
            "Okay. So it´s not for 8 GPUs.",
            "No.",
            "Ah, well",
            "But there some larger.",
            "PERSON3? What is the What is the memory of those GPUs?",
            "Like this cluster is full. This kind of You know.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is it is hard to receive more than one GPU there.",
            "Okay, yes, so let´s wait for our cluster. I also started with multisource synthetic corpus. And I and I think we need to to do it itterative back translation on on Czech German news to have some higher quality in GermanCzech news corpus. And then we can combine it with with English Czech, which is already high quality from PROJECT1",
            "Yeah.",
            "Then we can",
            "So so the models have to be of comparable quality, so that the uh, the multisource has a chance to be useful, right? Is is that the idea?",
            "Probably yes. And also we can take a look in the And I can also send you eh how how they do this eh data collection in ORGANIZATION6, if  that would help. Or",
            "So maybe you can discuss like directly after the call. So l le let let´s keep this call running for longer, but let´s finish the the common part. For the common part I would just like to highlight the one more thing. And it´s PERSON7and PERSON15. Both of you should be working now on that multilingual PROJECT4 systems, right? Is that kind of eh, of the current summary or are you more working on eh, s whatever data augmentation for PROJECT4 or So maybe PERSON7?",
            "Um, well, I'm working on the chopped data set as already",
            "Yeah.",
            "Already told you. Yeah. So it is kind of I don´t know whether it´s strictly",
            "The data augmentation.",
            "But yeah, yeah. It´s rather data data augmentation.",
            "For better PROJECT4. And your model is only for offline processing? Eh, so eh, eh How far did you get with the onlinezation? Because that is something which we would If your model eh, evaluates well, using PROJECT2 on PROJECT5 test set, we would like to have that integrated. But I know that it´s eh, behaved differently. Eh, it doesn´t emit word by word. So eh, eh. If we have anyone with the capacity and the best person will be probably PERSON10. Then it would be great to eh, like ask someone to help you, for example PERSON10, to to help you, with the onlinezation of your model. So please keep that in mind eh, that we want to evaluate your model and if it looks good, then we want to have that integrated.",
            "Yes, eh, the question is whether we would want to use just a ORGANIZATION1as a model. The CTC eh endtoend model or we want to use the extended one, the the cascaded model from my thesis. The eh, the ORGANIZATION1, translates phonemes and then followed by transform.",
            "Whichever whichever evaluates better in the offline run.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "The the ev the evaluation of the offline runs is, is the deciding thing. And I would like eh, to ask Umar to also work on the eh, on the same data and keep training. The ORGANIZATION13 set up, right?",
            "Uhm.",
            "Yeah, so people are disappearing. Thank you for your participation. That´s okay. Thank you very much. And uh, just PERSON15 just stay here with PERSON7Peter for second. Eeh, yeah.",
            "Yeah, sure.",
            "So whenever PERSON7, whenever you have the data ready, please get in touch with PERSON15. PERSON16 also please, train as a comparin compa comparison in using the exact same training data, exact of evaluation you two please be t in touch together. So that eh, ehm, s we have this old style cascaded, the new style cascaded possibly eeh, and eh, the the simple ORGANIZATION1only wou on the same augmented data set evaluated ehagainst each other.",
            "Okay.",
            "Right? Yeah, so I think Yeah?",
            "I have one more idea for PERSON4.",
            "Mhm, okay.",
            "You can try some transfer learning on on of double encoder model on small GPus. So if if we have trained model for EnglishCzech and GermanCzech, then then you can try to copy the parameters one encoder to to the double encoder model. From one model.",
            "Mhm. And that´s continue training on on the multisource data. So that it´s pretrained and it doesn´t eeeh like waste too much time in the in double encoder.",
            "Yes then we can experiment with this on small models and small GPUs at first, and then",
            "Yes. So that´s definitely Yes. This this is a general recommendation that holds for everybody who is trying to uh, put together new things. Always try it with small models and small data, and only once it works technically and does something very useful or on on this very small data set. Then use it eh, also a applied on the large data. Yeah, okay.",
            "So so PERSON4, if if you´re interested and I can write you some s some points how to start. You can contact me by email.",
            "Can you can you also maybe eh, if you are doing some communication. Can you maybe just g send the copy to me so that I know what models you are working on since I'm working on similarly on some multitargeted models.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah, oka.y So I´ll have to leave myself at this moment as well. So thank you very much for this call. I know it was very packed. And some of you ha ha have had only like few eh eh seconds of of like eh, strict things strictly relevant to you. But it will get better eh, in the coming weeks as we like synchronize more. Uh, so the the purpose of this meeting was eh, very greatly fulfilled. So thank you again, and please, do the discussions, eh, pairwise or in in small teams as as we have discussed. I´ll now leave the call myself. And eh, so who was eh, supposed to keep talking. Please keep talking on this call, feel free to do that. What´s what´s that.",
            "So so I I also have to leave, my lecture is ongoing and I have eh, said my part and I know what I should do next. And whom I should get connected with so I I´ll do all of these things after after the lecture.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Sorry for",
            "Yeah, that´s that´s okay. Thank you. Bye PERSON14.",
            "Thank you and bye.",
            "Yeah. So bye everybody. Yeah, thank you. Bye bye.",
            "PERSON7 can you stay for a while.",
            "So PERSON7 is staying, right? PERSON5 and PERSON16, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So I'm making now PERSON7the host of this call. Okay?",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Ehm, PERSON15 you wanted to ask something.",
            "Yes. I have one or two So first of all I need on which you´re working can you share the path with me?",
            "Um, yes sure, um. What I´m uh, really eh, working on is eh, like call it there chopped data set and with that I I I´m using regular eh, speech data set. ORGANIZATION11Common voice. And what I'm trying to do is to is to chop the utterences to words. So I´m using first alignment and ehm, eeh, what I what I´m want to do is to to chop the the utterences and recreate new sentences using eh using using the words itself. So it has eeh From my point of view it has eeh, few few at eh, few few eh Eeh, few things that can improve the eh, improve the the robustness of the PROJECT4. And it is that eh, eh, we can we can eh leverage more eh, nonnative dat nonnative speakers, as we can reuse more frequently the words eh, spoken by nonnatives. And also we can eh, create wholly new sentences, because ehm, when you´re training end to end PROJECT4, which is my case.",
            "The model is eeh, train not only the pronuncation model, but also also the language model. And this is especially hard, if we have only few data. And that´s actually the case of ORGANIZATION11 Common voice. .",
            "Mhm.",
            "Because eh, there are too many, you sentence, ther that´s eeh same or and they are just spoken by or read, because it it´s actually read data set. Eeh, and these same sentences are eh, read by eh, several speakers. And that´s why the the models which are trained only on on common voice are quite bad. Because the there are f only few sentences and the language model is  is quite bad then.",
            "so it´s that nonnative data set?",
            "Uh, well, it´s partially nonnative, partially native. Ehm, I´m I don´t know the exact statistics. I can I can eh I can checkt it. Eh",
            "Are you working on the same task which was due to the ORGANIZATION14challenge?",
            "Sorry, once again, because I I didn´t understand.",
            "I´m saying that are you working on the same, sorry. Are you working on the same thing that was due in ORGANIZATION14 challenge or is it something else?",
            "Uh, well, it´s not the Interspeech challenge, because it it was due twentieth of September. I guess. But eh, it´s actually very similar. I I I got the data from the challenge. And I don´t know whether we can use these data.",
            "Okay.",
            "I have to check I have to check  whether we are allowed to use these data. But eh, but for example, uh, there are in the in the ORGANIZATION11 Common voice data set there are twenty three percent unit United States English. Then there´s eight percent England English, five percent India and South Asia accent, four percent Australian English, three percent Canadian, two percent Scottish. One percent Irish, one percent Southern African and one percent New Zealand English. On the the data set also contains information about age and gender. Not all Not all not all the data points have these eh, these attributes, but some of them do have. And eh, that´s why I'm using this data set. But v ve very probably there´s even better data set that we can use for this.",
            "Mhm. So I I understand that but I couldn´t understand the main the main objective is it to train PROJECT7 in English PROJECT4? Is it so?",
            "Eeeeh, well, eh, the main objective is to train a robust PROJECT4.",
            "Robust English PROJECT4. And what does the robust means? Robust to the more",
            "Ro Em, robust towards accents and eh, mainly accents, but also generally robust by eh, creating eh, new sentences. Or new sentences or Using sentences that were not in the original data set. So because eeh, there is a lots of textual written data sets.  Or we can we can use for example subtitles which is written spoken langu written eh, written spoken language data set. And we can try to synthetize eh, using the existing words this new data sets. Even though we don´t have the original speech data.",
            "It´s oh, so which which toolkit are you using?",
            "Which to?",
            "Toolkit. Which toolkit are you using?",
            "Ehm, I am using the ORGANIZATION4toolkit.",
            "Okay, fine. So didn´t PERSON3 mention something with multilingual PROJECT4, or I´m I got wrong.",
            "Hm, well I should be I should start to work on multilingual PROJECT4, but eeh, this this  Because I I´m still at home and I eh, do not have much time to work. So I´m this this eh, what I´m really doing now and eh, probably next week I´ll be in Prague and I´ll start to work more more hard and maybe then I´ll I´ll be I´ll start with the wil with the multilingual PROJECT4. And",
            "I would just confused that what he is actually waiting from  He was something mentioning about the comparing the performance of your system with something So was he talking about the this multi accented PROJECT4 or was he talking of multilingual PROJECT4?",
            "Um, he was probably thinking the the PROJECT4 I created or or ri I´ll I´ve been using eh during my master the thesis. And That was eh Well, I was using eh, the original original eh, PROJECT4 provided by ORGANIZATION8. And I fine tuned it to Because it´s endtoend model I fine tuned it to recognize phonemes exe eh, eh rather than graphemes. And I eh, trained my own transfomer model that would translate the phonemes into graphemes and add eh, pun punctuation and eh, also to recover some errors. That were in the transcripts. So maybe he´s thinking about this.",
            "So that that was an English PROJECT4?",
            "Eh, English and Czech.",
            "Okay, okay. I I think I need need to work on whatever he was thinking about so I will just maybe first to the path of data from. And to evaluate the PROJECT4. So I need just eh, use the same data for ORGANIZATION13 evaluations. Does it make sense?",
            "Yes, yes. So eeh, what are the tasks we need to do Well, ehm There´s these there are the data from the ORGANIZATION14 challenge and we need to we need to check whether we can use these data.",
            "Mhm.",
            "But I'm afraid that these data are just eh, private and we cannot use them. Ehm, but we need to check.",
            "I I mean, if they there is something what he want So I can ask him once again.  I know I´m bit confused.",
            "And what next. Mm, and of course, I´ll I´ll have to use the common voice and maybe I´ll check fo another multilingual data set. But uh, I guess the the ORGANIZATION11Common voice is the best option as If I recall correctly, the most papers that work with accented speech eh, were are working with the Common voice data set.",
            "That´s bad. I think will multilingual through different things. Isn´t it so?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Multilingual are different, and well, multiaccented are different. Maybe I have said wrong word. But I I meant eh, multiaccented.",
            "Okay, so so if that was that requirement, then please share the with me of the data set. We train the set and we test it. And this will be ORGANIZATION13 again or same model And then we  I think we can compare the of more systems.",
            "Mhm mhm. Yes.",
            "So I'm leaving a message for you on",
            "Well, if it´s okay for you I I´m not  I rather use mail. If it´s okay for you.",
            "Okay, that´s that´s I´ll then eh, leave the message for you on mail and whenever you have time",
            "Okay, so I guess I think is evertyhing.",
            "Is there anything?",
            "I think it´s everything, yeah.",
            "So okay, if we don´t have anything, thanks for your time.",
            "Thank you very much too. Bye.",
            "Bye."

            "Yeah. Hi, hello, sorry for coming late. So are you all here?",
            "Yes, hello.",
            "PERSON16. We have two PERSON7s.",
            "Hello.",
            "So you are. Uh, PERSON7 you are trying to, uh, recover from your past, uh, missed sessions uh, uh, by coming twice.  That's good. Yeah. I was also hoping to see PERSON6, but yeah that's not the case. Never mind. Uh, so let's be quick and yeah. Uh, I would like primarily to ask PERSON16 and PERSON3,uh, to debag, what was the problem yesterday. Because yesterday, the experience was simply disastrous again. Uh, and, um  Uh, so it didn't. Uh, it was, uh, very badly recognised and it was also slow. Uh, so, uh, uh, PERSON16 would you have any, uh, any explanation, uh, for, the slowness? You're muted. Uh.",
            "Yeah, hi, sorry. So I mean, no, uh, uh, for slowness there is just one explanation. And that is, uh, I need to be logged into, one, of, the machines.",
            "Yes, okay. So there was, uh, yeah. And can it also affect the recognition quality or is it just slower?",
            "Uh, no. It is just slow.",
            "So, uh, coul. Please get in touch as I wrote yesterday. Please get in touch with PERSON9, uh and, uh, try to debug the, that again. I will download the recording from yesterday. So you can, uh, probably replay that and, uh, see what we can do about the, uh, recognition quality. And um, uh, yes, uh, then I would. PERSON3 has added some files, uh, to the PROJECT12 Test set. These are also English, non native, and in the PROJECT16. So please evaluate that. And otherwise, what is your, uh, progress with other things, evaluation and.",
            "Uh, so today I'm supposed to. So basically, we had a call with PERSON12 last night. And so I have to address this problem where the files were too big, so I could not get uploaded to PROJECT3.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So I had to address that. So right now, I am looking into that. So how could I identify the files, which are too big to be uploaded to PROJECT3.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, please do. Please commit everything that, uh, that PERSON12 has created. Because it is bad that we do not have this version.",
            "Yes. So I 'll do for like one folder, and then they will do it for the rest.",
            "Mhm",
            "So I, I was doing it it now, just before this call.",
            "Uh and uh. This is, uh, mainly for the preparation for the domain adaptation, right? Is that.",
            "Yes. For the And I haven't heard back from PERSON4 on whether ORGANIZATION1 server is up again or not. Yes, I will probably talk to, to him again about this.",
            "Yeah, uh, uh, also please be in touch with PERSON4. Uh, for the extended set of target languages. So far, and it is set of target languages. And are you in touch with PERSON14 for,uh, the text files for the dominetration.",
            "Yes, uh, he is doing that. So, uh, he has set up PROJECT4 by now.",
            "So, uh, that is uh, uh, I, don't think that is needed. So I think we primarily need PERSON14 to collect the text data. The domain specific data. And yes, doing something with PROJECT4 is useful in the long term, but it is better if people who already have that experience do it now.",
            "Yes, uh. So, yeah, so he is trying to do that. Uh, I think he mentioned that. Uh, ORGANIZATION10, uh, does not give direct access. So he has applied for it. So the data that ORGANIZATION10 has are just view, uh, read only. I mean you can't download it or",
            "Uh, well.",
            "Also there are videos, so that even the transcript, you can't get it it unless you apply for it. So first, we have to make an account to get to see the dataset. And then",
            "Uh, so is, he is that the full PROJECT13 archive?",
            "I think so.",
            "So that is huge. So that is not the point. So what it should at least explain to him that there is a clear distinction between the PROJECT13 Archive, which are the interviews with the survivors of World War II of of the Holocaust. And, uh, uh, some conferences about that. So it's like, uh, the historical evidence, the recordings, and then the historical papers and presentations by historicians. And we are interested in the latter in the, in the historians talking about that. We are not so interested in the old people giving their memories as such. So this",
            "Even their presentations, it was the case. So that is why I think he has applied for one.",
            "Okay.",
            "And he is waiting for the access. It is. It was the case in the ORGANIZATION10's archive. Yeah, so I thought so.",
            "So, in short, he should also scan the web pages of the people. Scan in breath, rather than in depth. So it is like breath for scan for the data so that he has whatever he can, even if he is still waiting for some resource. So please explain this to him.",
            "Yes, I'll do that.",
            "Okay, thank you. Great. And let us quickly move to, uh, to others. I see also, PERSON3, is joining. That is, uh, that is good. Maybe since I, we have now PERSON6 and PERSON2. Yeah, unfortunately, I'm still horribly struggling with the ORGANIZATION6, uh, ORGANIZATION6 demo papers which are due tomorrow. And I really have to do it tomorrow during the day. Not not too late, because, like, I will be busy the the whole Saturday, and I have to go early to bed on on Friday. So my time is very limited. And, uh, I have now, uh, started worrying about the calculations of a number of things. So PERSON6 and PERSON2, will you be here after the call. Can we continue after, uh, we finished.",
            "This is just because I have dentist's appointment, uh, in one hour. Okay, yes, but I read your comments there. I just wanted to assure you. I think for some of them, we are calculating exactly the way we should do if you see the code? Ah, you will see.",
            "So, uh, the mind concern now was the alignment based thing. And whether it actually does the max, uh, or, uh, something, like that.",
            "Yes, exactly. If we have for example, we consider we should, it should be 200. But the alignment waits for it saves is for number for example 800. We considered it the marginal one. And we calculate character after that.",
            "Mhm. Okay, so please, please have a look at the PROJECT2, the PROJECT2 environment in the PROJECT7 paper. And in the PROJECT2 environment I explained in two cases, German to English and English to German what is probably going to. What is probably happening according to the description in the paper and what should be happening. So that we actually give more time to the system. So please have a look at that. And like after we finish with the general call, if you're still available, if you do not have to rush for your dentist, uh, then we can discuss this.",
            "Okay, okay, so that's But. Or for example, I can answer the exact about the PROJECT2. I can send you an email when I come back.",
            "Yes, uh, yeah.",
            "This is exactly the reason why I came to this call. Because I wanted to miss this meeting, but the reason I came just to say this. Because, because in fourty five minutes I have the appointment. I want to go. Anyway. Just I will see all of your things, and I will check the code, and we will answer everything in detail in one email to you.",
            "Yeah, okay. Well, if you have time in the afternoon for a call.",
            "Afternoon yes, yes.",
            "That would probably be faster, but anyway write the answers, uh, down. Thanks. Okay. And, uh, I would like to ask PERSON15, because he",
            "PERSON13, sorry. PERSON2, PERSON2 is actually still, is still here so and he works.",
            "Okay, okay, that's good.",
            "Because I'm not here but.",
            "Yeah. Okay, thank you. So the other paper is the PROJECT12 demo paper. And I still, uh, did not have any chance to reopen it. So PERSON15, I think you wrote most of the paper. Uh, am I correct?",
            "No.",
            "No? Okay, so, so, who who wrote that actually?",
            "I don't think so.",
            "So, could you. Uh, could you perhaps, uh, try revising the paper and looking at the reviews that we got? And try to, uh, like a help with that one?",
            "I don't have an access to the reviews.",
            "Oh! Uh, that is strange?",
            "Is it in our leaf?",
            "Reviews ORGANIZATION8. Yes, it is.",
            "How is it called?",
            "Reviews dash ORGANIZATION8.",
            "I can't find it.",
            "You can 't find it? Uh, PROJECT12 multilingual life subtitling. I will email you the link.  So probab Is it possible that there is some different version? So the paper is supposed to be six, uh, pages long. It lists everybody. Yeah, you are probably there. So there is reviews plain text file. They say that we have in a little impact, or they, they don't like it. Uh, that is horrible.  Yeah. So if you could look at this, this would be extremely, uh, extremely useful. Okay.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Uh, let's move on to. Uh, yeah, experiments. Uh, let us move on to, yeah, uh, the, uh, the idea that I have, uh, discussed yesterday, but ORGANIZATION2 is not too keen on that. So the PROJECT14 quality is very bad for all, uh, remotely handled sessions, and especially if people are wearing face masks. And the the idea that I have is that we use again a brute force. And, uh, we pass all our training data through PROJECT8 and other systems in an automated way so that we get the data distorted, uh, um, in the same way as these platforms distort it, and also that we will use a frequency filter to cut down on the hate, on the like high frequencies. Which mimics what the face masks do. And then we would, uh, either ourselves retrain that, or we would also like happily shift, send the data to ORGANIZATION2 and ask them to train their system, because their system is is online and, uh, fully integrated.",
            "So if you, um, would anyone have thethe time for that? That it will be some scripting of of user interface in, uh, in PROJECT15, and and uh. Like it is not too bad if you, uh, if you would run it in four PROJECT8 sessions in parallel. Uh, then in a week, you would get like 600 hours. So it's without. There there would be some extra overhead, uh, um, for for the restart or whatever, but it but it should work. Ah, so is anybody, uh, curious about learning how to automate, uh, x Windows and, uh and or perhaps windows that can be done also with Windows. Oh, okay. Well, then I'll have to look at it myself. Well, but please talk to me if you if you can. Okay, uh?.",
            "Sorry, I can try, but still I have to see.",
            "Yeah, so so PERSON16, you should work on the evaluations first and fore So for you, this is a lower priority I think. Uh, because you. You should be like really focusing on getting it uh, uh, getting the systems ready. So I've already talked to PERSON15. I hope that you can have a look at the paper. Sorry for this last, uh, second notification again. And if, if you can briefly say what you have done so far.",
            "Which paper? This PROJECT12? The multi ORGANIZATION8 demo?",
            "ORGANIZATION8 demo yeah.",
            "Yes, I just opened it. And I need some time to read the reviews.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But I mean your other work, if you can, briefly say.",
            "I'm continuing with data preparation of ORGANIZATION5 corpus. And right now, I'm running the first alignments on on the manually revised the Dev test. And then I want to rerun the alignments of source and targets of of the interpreters and do some analysis on them. Repeat the the old analysis I have on more accurate alignments.",
            "Mhm. Yeah, us okay, so you. And, uh, thanks for this update. This is the good. Ah, and do you have any update from PERSON5. And, oh, has he started to write the, uh, the summary of",
            "Uh, oh, I do not have any update. And he wrote at he is busy with exams.",
            "Yeah.",
            "In January. So I suggest that, uh, like you. If you have some long term processing of ORGANIZATION5 that is like where computation time is needed, then start it. But otherwise I suggest that you, uh, move or give more priority to the the write up of the experiment with PERSON5, because he will also be struggling. It would be like his first paper, uh, anyway. So, if you could start, uh, start with that. Uh, we would have better chance to, uh, to finish it in time.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thanks PERSON7 for the suggestion, uh, to just to use PROJECT10 audio codec. So perhaps you are in the best position to, uh, to process the files. uh, if you have any experience with with that? Could you get in touch with PERSON8 and process all the files that PERSON8 has for, um, uh, English, uh, training data we need. We need Czech",
            "Yeah, sure I, I can get in touch with him.",
            "Yeah, so we need Czech as well. But we need Czech only in February. Uh, whereas we need English, uh, in, like on the 25th like in 10 days. I do not know whether ORGANIZATION2 can fine tune. Uh, uh, any of their models. Uh, like continue training. But if we process the data that that we have for English, for them. Uh, they could give it a try. And the performance was so bad that we really need to like go into this and and try to improve, uh, that.",
            "Oh, oh, oh, all right.",
            "Yeah. Great, thanks. And to start a paper on the study. OK thanks. So then, PERSON7, uh since I've already asked you, uh, please summarize for everybody. What is your status with the, uh, with the, uh, pipeline preparation, or pipeline configuration tool. Oh yeah, sure.",
            "So basically, when we create a pipeline for some event. It consists of a multiple parts, like some PROJECT14, um, some machine translation and, uh, some online, uh, subtitles. And for, uh, for every event, we need to, uh, make this pipeline in a different way. Sometimes we use one component, uh, sometimes we us, uh, another component. And ,uh, I'm writing a tool that, uh, will allow an operator to define the, uh, the part, of the pipeline and how they are connected. And the tool will make a script, that will make sure that everything is corrected as it was specified. And there should also be some support for a docker, uh, and part of the pipeline that are, that are in docker. And, yeah, so that's that.",
            "Yeah. So let me let me also add to that. Uh, that the pipeline will be defined in terms of like abstract graph, in a way, uh, and, then it will be compiled to a batch launcher, or a docker launcher, or or evaluation launcher. And the evaluation launcher that would run the pipeline through the PROJECT12 test set, uh, with PROJECT7. That we would know, uh, which of the parts of the pipeline are, performing badly in terms of translation quality. Uh, I just, uh. It just occurred to me that there should be one more compilation target. And that would be like probing whether the components of the pipeline are up and running. Uh, like a test of availability. So that's another thing that, that PERSON7, uh, uh, uh, should on. if you could put this on, uh, on the to do list or on the enhancement options, that would also be very useful.",
            "Uh, and another thing would be, uh, like live debugging, uh, of a of a pipeline such a speed of, uh, of that. Okay. And, uh, yes, and uh, so, and then the second item you have in your list PERSON7. Please comment on that. .",
            "All, right. So, uh, next Friday, uh, like, next week somewhere there there is going to be a conference about PROJECT13 and we are going to provide life subtitles and transcription. And because we will have some non native English speakers in there, so we will need to get some feedback, from the people that are using our subtitles. Preferab, refe, preferably life. So we can, uh, see a moments like, uh, where it was working and moments where it was not working. So, uh ,I will make some, uh, quick took.",
            "PERSON15 already has such simple tool that you could adapt. Um, what is more. What is missing is, uh, description, of, ah, like how to use the tool. And also more like a generic description of how people should look at the outputs. So, uh, it would be best, if you could get in touch with PERSON18. Because I've asked PERSON18 to like handle the soft, uh, soft things with the participants and also with the organisers. And, uh, um, you and PERSON18 should prepare very simple instructions that the participants could follow. And it would be both for just giving them access to the subtitles and uh, separately. If the organisers say, that it is it is reasonable to ask such a thing, to get feedback from the uh, from the participants. You and PERSON18, you and PERSON18 if you could, uh, um, could come up with the strategy, like the set of things that we want to offer and that we want to ask for.",
            "So it would be easiest if you get directly in touch with her. And if you two synchronised. Oh, okay. I will write. I I I will an email. .",
            "Yeah. It's on the twenty fifth on January. So there is a week and a day. It's not much, but it's not starting immediately. Okay, thanks. Uh, and so. So, uh, and PERSON15, if you could share with, uh, PERSON7 your simple feedback clicking page.",
            "Okay.",
            "Which may be useful. Or or it may be like. Given the quality is pretty bad, uh, we don't want to like, uh, ask the people, to tell us, it's bad, it's bad, it is bad, it's bad, like, it's We, we need some, uh, some more useful information. Uh, and if our outputs are so bad as they were yesterday, then there is actually no point in collecting the feedback at all. So hopefully we'll we'll have better working system on, uh, on the twenty fifth. Uh, yeah, okay. And, uh, okay. So PERSON6, you found that maximisation. So just the description is wrong, right?",
            "Yes. Sorry. Just, I called my dentist and asked him, okay, I can come one hour later.",
            "Okay.  Okay thanks.",
            "So I'm sitting in the chat. Everything, because when you finish, I want to describe what what",
            "Okay that is, good. Yeah. So, the, uh, we have PERSON3 so PERSON3, please tell us what is your status.",
            "Sorry. Yeah. I I I I I don't know what's my status.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I sent, uh, let's uh, uh. You should focus on the like separate stand alone one shot of things.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So please do the, uh, uh, as as I wrote in the email, uh, do the files.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And also, uh, if PERSON11, uh, and and PERSON16 find out some PROJECT13 data in the public domain, please add them to the public part of PROJECT12 test set. I have already provided, uh, PROJECT13, one PROJECT13 interview in the confidential part. Uh, so, uh.",
            "Yeah, about that yeah?.",
            "Yeah, this is also for for PERSON16. PERSON16, please do evaluate the, uh, the, systems, uh, on everything. So that the next week same time, uh, you can present the summary, uh, of which, uh, PROJECT14 systems and which PROJECT1 systems we have at hand. Uh, and what are their scores on the various domains.",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So so you you two, please make sure that we evaluate everything on everything, and we, uh, can choose the the best set up.",
            "And also has the presenter. The speaker of the last last week's has manually transcribed?",
            "No They haven't. I haven't sent them the transcripts yet, because, uh, I shall have to rerun the transcript late. So that I have, uh, like clean set of transcript. Because, uh if I remember, uh in the meeting. In the last seminar, uh, the, pipe was, stuck at a point. So I have to do it, uh, once again.",
            "Okay, and, I, I will also send you another PROJECT3 repository, which we have that, uh, these presenters would be. Speakers generally use to erase. To make some PERSON17es in their editor and to the manual, or a revision of more more conveniently.",
            "Okay, thanks.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON1 is the last person, uh, mentioned in the uh, uh, uh, in in the in the report. Uh, and he successfully developed a shortening PROJECT1, um, English to Czech. So there is something which makes the output 80 percent of the input length and the bleu score, yes, is lower, but just the shorter outflow the lower the bleu score. So by looking at the outputs, we are actually quite happy with the result. And this is also something that I really want PERSON16 to include, uh, uh, in the evaluations. So make it a new evaluation campaign, uh, uh, in the PROJECT12 test set evaluations. And put the multiple PROJECT1 systems, including the shortening PROJECT1 systems based on what PERSON1 provides, so that we can look at the outputs. I'm saying that it has to be committed to the PROJECT12 test set evaluations, because the bleu scores will be definitely lower.",
            "So we need to look at the output ourselves, right?.",
            "Yes. Uh, so, uh, to be evaluated in, uh, new, uh, PROJECT12 test set evaluations, uh, campaign. Uh, the output needs to be manually, uh, validated or, uh, or evaluated bleus are bound to be lower. Okay, uh, so I think that is probably everything right?",
            "Mhm do you want to continue.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So, uh, if if anybody has anything else to say to to all others. Oh, actually, PERSON8 PERSON8 PERSON8 you're here and you did not say anything. So what is your status.",
            "Yes, I'm I'm working on the chopped, uh, training. Ah, I do not know if it is relevant for others. But , uh, the idea is that, um, I, um, I align, uh, training data that we have. For example, for English, and I 'm now working on English and, um, I cut the recordings, uh, to words. And then, uh, using, uh, external, uh, other text resources. I create new recordings from, from the words from the separate words. So, uh, there may be, uh, two benefits for for such thing. And there is that we can create more robust PROJECT14 that is that is not for refitting any speaker we can read, because we can um. We can, uh, for example, alter the distribution of speakers, or and uh, the second, uh, important, uh, gain that may be from this method is that the end to end PROJECT14 models, um, are creating implicit language models within.",
            "And because the are the corpora, the corpora, um, the speech corpora have limited, uh, ss text then. Uh, and if we create, uh, if if we use another text like from. For for, for example, uh, some, some ,uh, some pure uh textual, uh, corpora that we can, uh, we can train on more, um, more texts or so. So the, so the, so the, um, implicit language model with which inside the PROJECT14 can be more robust. .",
            "Yeah, okay. So, yeah, any new. Uh, how far, are you? Uh, you are. Generating?",
            "Well, uh, I'm able to generate. Uh, the recordings. Uh, now I'm str struggling to optimize the the pipeline, because, uh, I, I've I tried to plug it in the standard training pipeline, but it was too slow. So, um, well. I need to somehow figure out how to how to, uh, create it, uh, quickly. And, um, and, uh, the problem is with, uh, the big corpora the be the big textural corpora like Czech. If I want to create a, uh, like for for the PROJECT11 speech, uh, text, uh, I'm doing there is so many such manner that. Um, I, I just , uh, create all the recordings for the all, all sentences in the corpus. And I create some deal direction, and I put all the recordings. And, uh, I have, uh, a job running on the cluster that is, uh, constantly, uh, rewriting, uh, new versions of, of, each, text, and, uh, it, is, it.",
            "The the, uh, the job is bit quicker than the training is so. .",
            "Mhm.",
            "So in this way we are sure that each recording is, uh, seen by the, by the, uh, neural network only once. But, uh, the problem is with Czech, because, uh, the PROJECT11 speech for example has a , uh, less than three hundred thousands texts. And, uh, common with the, PERSON17 has like fifty or millions of recordings. So, uh, . For, for, because we do not have enough disk space and. And because we can't store fifty million recordings on the disc.",
            "So But can you do it like in a rolling buffer on the disks so that you would actually be training over whatever, let's say.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah I.",
            "I thought so, I thought, so, but, uh, I need to. Uh, the the training pipeline on, that, private data stood loader within the PROJECT9, uh framework is a black box and it is quite complicated. So, uh, I need to, uh somehow find how it works. And, uh, so I either I have some, uh, precise order, of, of, of, the elements. And then I then maybe. And then I can get it running properly in this way. Like in with the rolling, rolling window.",
            "Okay, yeah, great. Thanks.",
            "And and maybe one thing on PERSON15. He has sent me an email with the PROJECT5 Some questions about PROJECT5. It was I guess how much I I want to be played from the PROJECT5. Maybe this is question on you too PERSON13. And, uh, we have, I guess, uh, um, uh, discussed this, uh, earlier. But, uh, I'm not sure I should be paid from PERSON19's PROJECT5 tool. So, maybe, or how, wha what's the split. What should be the split with this.",
            "Yeah. Uh this also needs to be. I will do it half and half without any further information.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That's something that. Please talk to her, uh, uh, giving, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So she is giving a talk, uh, this afternoon, somewhere a remote one, uh, but after that, she, she would be hopefully available for to say, what is the status with the PROJECT5. So please ask her directly.",
            "Okay, thank you.",
            "I would I would use the same number, the same amount from the two PROJECT5s.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah. Okay, so great. That's. So that's everything for the most of you. And now I would like to talk to uh, uh, PERSON6 and of course PERSON2. About the, uh, PROJECT7. Thanks everybody, and let us just see, eh, each other again with, uh, the latest, uh, next, next Thursday. Thank you.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, bye bye.",
            "Yeah, bye.",
            "Yeah PERSON13.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I've sent you an email. That's for your information. Because I've seen your concern, maybe I can describe and you can see the formula here. And yeah, ah, I I think even in the at the beginning, we decided first to calculate C without any alignment. Then, when calculated with alignment. We just put the maximum between without alignment and with alignment.",
            "Uh, yes, but this is not the same as what I'm asking for. So I'll, I'll share my screen. Uh, and open the overleaf so it will take a while, sorry. Uh, what is distance? I do not know, that is something else.",
            "You want the previous word. Yes?",
            "Uh none ,uh, not. Just let me let me open the overleaf when I? Oh, that is horrible. Uh, yeah. I need to So that's and then overleaf. So I hope you can see my screen now.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah, so here is the PROJECT2 thing . PROJECT2. Yep, so what I'm illustrating is the, uh, German and English, uh, where the German verb is split into two parts. And the second part is the content bearing, and ,uh, would get very likely aligned to this, uh, to the late part of the German verb would get aligned to the English word. So when translating from English into German. Uh, the uh problem I see there is, uh, that uh, the alignment information between set and \"gezacht\" would bring the early time stamp of the \"said\" to the late part. So this is, uh, the fí values, using, uh, alignment.",
            "No.",
            "Yeah, alignment only. Given the, uh, current max, uh, and PROJECT11, uh, uh, there it would actually be okay. Due, uh, uh, uh because the, uh, the proportional position of \"gezacht\" is at the end of the segment.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes, so that that is good. Um, uh, but that is not so. So your solution does not have the problem here, but I think it still has the problem here. And the problem here is when we were going from German into England to English. The German sentence will say \"Ich habe\" and then something very long here, and something vey long and \"gezacht\" So the \"gezacht\" appears as late as 1500. And then when getting the reference. So the reference translation, again, has the same alignment. \"Said\" goes to \"gezacht\". Uh, and by that, we do bring in the 1500, as the expected time for \"said\".",
            "Yes.",
            "That is good. Uh. So the the verb itself is not expected any sooner than the source verb was uttered. Yeah.",
            "Exactly.",
            "But the problem I see there is with the subsequent words in the sentence. Who, whi which are more more or less monotonically aligned to the to the English. So there from alignment they would receive time stamps like 800, 900 or 1000. And unfortunately, if the PROJECT1 system decides to obey the standard English grammar, it will cash these words. And it will wait with them only until it has guessed the verb, and then it would emit all the words at once.",
            "Exactly.",
            "So I, what I said.",
            "So, so proportionately. I do not hear you well. Let let me finish, and then hopefully the microphone will get better in the meantime. Uh, proportionally, uh, the alignment values and the proportional values will be comparable. So it would be like, maybe not, not eight hundred, but maybe. Well, it could be related the same values. So the proportion or alignment directly values will all require these words to be emitted, like it they would, it would expect these words to be emitted sooner than a previous word. So based on this linear ordering of the words in the reference. My proposal is to, uh, maximize not only with the value from the proportional alignment as you are doing at the moment. But rather with the, uh, with the value of the previous word.",
            "Yes, but.",
            "So that way. So this, this 1500, would max out all the rest of the sentence.",
            "Yes, yes. Was an impression, because at this. My mind was calculating everything in Persian in that time. For example, sometimes you can clean it. There were a lot of sentences in the beginning at the end. Maybe if the sentence is not very good, but it has a meaning. But in this case. If in German, uh, yes, if, for example, you, you cannot say the rest before saying there verb. I agree with you. So we just need to, okay, just check the maximum, eh? You know, increased. Uh, you know, progressive maximum. All numbers should be more than this. It is very easy. And I think it should be done. Yes, and I'm agreeing with you.",
            "I'm thinking, so I'll I'll write the paper as if we are doing this already. And you need to fix that. Yeah.",
            "Yes, it's simple.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'll I'll write this. Uh, uh, that we are maxing out with the previous words.",
            "Yes.",
            "Uh, my question on PERSON2 and you is now, if we if you are able to, uh, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the. That is, that is a lot of work. Ah, in the pictures, these pictures are okay, but, uh, if we were able to illustrate this, uh, this alignment, it, would be perhaps even better. So, uh, I don't, know if you have uh, anywhere in your data, uh, uh, uh, some such example. You have the alignment. Ah, uh, alignment files. So if you could search for a similar simple sentence, uh, that, that, has, this, uh, alignment, uh, that that would be useful. So if PERSON2 could look at that. So that's one thing. And another thing is whether we want to max it also with the proportional value. And I'm not sure about this. I would suggest that we do not max it with the proportional value.",
            "Yeah, it's not correct.",
            "Because it's not correct. If we if we are doing the alignment based thing, then we should follow the alignment and this like maxing, uh, uh, of the linear order progress of the maximisation. That makes sense. But maxing it with the, uh, with the, uh, with the, like proportional alignment, doesn't make sense to me.",
            "There is another reason. Because for example, the only acceptable reason the translator didn't for example write this other word is waiting for this one.",
            "Mhm.",
            "After that, it should both of them together, if shouldn't wait and then",
            "Yes, yes exactly, yes.",
            "So I think If, if, if it's a reason it should come up all in one line.",
            "Yes, exactly. So it should not lose anything in in delay.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, the the evaluation would be different if we were producing a spoken output. So there there is a a recent paper. Where by do people PERSON17e the speed of the text to speech. So that they can then recover. And they are emitting these words in some intelligible way. Not too fast and not too slow. So depending on how much input they have in the pipeline, they are PERSON17ing the speed. That is a different model, uh, uh, at the output. Okay, so this is clear. So, PERSON2, if if you could look for examples like the one in the PROJECT2 case, that would be great. Otherwise just please do the PERSON17es of the labels. As I asked for. Uh, about the merger of the pictures. I would like delay that I I think that has a lower, uh, priority. And then I also had the questions for the, um,.",
            "Yeah, so there I I 'm not sure if I actually wrote the questions down. So the the segmentation strategies. Ah, so yeah, this is. I see this. PERSON10, please check. This is actually wrong. Uh, uh.",
            "I will check this one and the other one.",
            "No they This is actually wrong. Based on what's in, uh, section on multiple refs below. So I will, uh, I will fix that. So, I I've already found the answer. I was I was wrong here. So the segmentation strategies are clear. But the. Yes, the delay calculation, uh, the simple one. So, I'll PROJECT8 the picture here. And are the numbers still legible?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So I was kind of expecting. So, it's it's okay in the simply like calculation that O is located at 235, because, that is when O was emitted. I am happy to see that the \"tshirt\" in German is located as at 400. Because that is what when this was emitted. That is, that is good. But I'm confused by the numbers in here. I've done the, uh, uh, the differences between each pair of, um, uh, words, and the differences are not the same. So is it proportional? And if then to what?",
            "It isn't proportional. But I think last time when we made. We met in the seminar room again. We had this problem, and we put everything on the paper. The hand calculated, and I think those numbers, all of them was card. But if you want a can, again, do a calculation very clearly again, because I have not rechecked this. Yes, well, the difference are definitely not the same. So here you have a sick 58. If I'm doing the calculation right. Here you have a 43. Here you have 25.",
            "Mhm. Because. The reason is, uh. Okay, I think it was based on the number of characters. Something like that PERSON2.",
            "Yes, so so please have a look at it. I think that the current description is like excessively detailed and actually confusing and not correct . What what I would say is that But check if it matches the code. That we, uh, simply equidistantly split this time, uh, into the words based on their length. And full stop.",
            "Maybe it is that, yes. I will I will double check it. Excuse me. I need to write.  And here. Okay.",
            "And so then. Then the formula, there should be a formula. The formula should be like, what is the value for the word \"Ein\" or the eath word, uh, uh, in the table T. So how do we arrive at this three o four. And it should be just the proportion of the characters in \"Oh das ist\" And then I don't know whether you do include or do not include design \"ein\" in the total number of characters from. Tshirt as that is missing, uh. So the there should be just a number of characters, and the time stamp of O and the time stamp of Tshirt. That should be the formula, um. and the formula. If you apply the formula to O itself, it should obviously arrive at two, three, five. And if you if you apply the same formula for Tshirt, it should obviously arrive at four, four, zero.",
            "Mhm. All right. Because because as I remember simpler calculations. It should be based on only C.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Oh yes, yes.",
            "It is not on C. There is two, 0, four, and not two, three, five. So, this is what is also confusing to me.",
            "Ah, first time you see the 0, the first time you see this,.",
            "I think this is like the end of the word.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Well, it depends what you are doing. I think it would actually make more sense to have. To really based it on C and have this, uh, h, and put here at the end of the world. But the end of the world is like three characters proportionally from two, 0, four. And that it is probably something different than two, three, five.",
            "Yes.",
            "So let us make it simple. So if please check your formulas. I 'm not sure if if PERSON2 is following. Or you can explain that to him as well. So what i would suggest is, really base it on only C. So two, 0, four and four four zero.",
            "Mhm.",
            "And then the number of characters. And and this should be the end times of the words. So the end time for t shirt is this four, four, zero. That is good, that here the formula should work. But here the formula should arrive at something different, not necessarily this two, three, five.",
            "Sure, but just give me. Okay, I will I will check this very carefully and will answer you in email if it is something else. But or if it is not, I will write all of this details, you said. And PERSON17ed the code to, uh, I don't know. Answer back to the character. And only afterwards.",
            "Based on characters at the end time of ,uh, of the word. And based only on those time stamps in C. Just can I ask if, PERSON2, if you follow, I. Could you say. Could you just confirm it is based on characters?",
            "Hi everyone. No it is based on the words.",
            "Words? So why is it different. So how do you check it then? Because I forgot it.",
            "Fe, feel, feel free to switch to Persian for now if it's faster. Because time is.",
            "You can answer me in Persian, it is okay, PERSON2.",
            "Okay, so.",
            "It considers these partial words. And for example takes some estimation for the first word, second word, third word. frourth, fifth and sixth word, so six words in English. But for, in our reference in German for example it is seven words. Somehow proportional, finds their for example destination. Or for example when we expect this word. Based on the place of this word. For example if it is seventh, for example if it is fifth word it calculated it. Something like that.",
            "Mhm. Yeah, but it is so, uh. Do we? Yeah, so I understand the the motivation. The motivation is to use to make use of these partial numbers.",
            "Exactly. But the reason it is partial it is only to see them.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The first time the word appears.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Something like that. Sorry, sorry, the first time the word reaches in the C. For example if they are that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some words can be deleted afterwards.",
            "Exactly.",
            "I am thinking if this is simple enough to call it simple.  Uh, so so what you think if we, uh, if we really PERSON17ed the simple calculation to something which is based only on the C segment and the number of characters?. There there will. Again that will bring another set of problems obviously. For numbers for example. Like if you have, uh,1986, uh, then that would be four characters in the transcript, and then very long, uh, time span. So that will, in your case, that would probably work better, like your solution would probably work better. So I 'll let us keep your solution as it is. So it is not based on characters at all.",
            "But just for information PERSON13. There is another type of calculation which is only based on the C, but we are. We didn't mention it on the paper.",
            "Okay, yeah, well, let's keep the paper as it is, Like, let's not add any further things. So, then if this is based also on the partial, uh, segments. Then I 'm confused that they. Oh, that is because it is proportional in the number of words. I see. So because \"das\" is perfectly aligned to this. But that's the alignment view, and \"das\" is not like perfectly aligned to, uh, to this, uh if you look at it, proportionately. Because there are seven words in German and six in English.",
            "But, but is is mainly for when we, for example, we do not have any alignment information.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll. I now understand. But the problem is that there is nothing in the paper that would allow people to calculate this. Well, there is the formula. But that is very complicated.",
            "Yes. But all of these calculations are in the formula, I think, because if you remember the formula. First ot finds the place, for example, is between the word of, for example, the first and the second word. It's between each of the four. Then based on that. For example, the time find the exact some estimation for when that word should appear. There is some in formula. Yes, you are right. It is not simple, but it is based on that formula. If you put on that formula, you can find this numbers.",
            "Okay, so I 'll try to decipher the foreground now with the explanation. So I think I know everything. Please have a look at the. If you can find an example with the reordering and definitely do PERSON17e the code towards the maximization. Uh, like that.",
            "For this one, for sure today, we will finish it after this PERSON17e, because it is very easy. It is just one or two lines.",
            "Okay, okay, thank you. So that is probably it. I'll I may email you in the afternoon if I still need some help, but I hope I do not actually need. Uh, the only like when you, if you find an example? Uh, that would be, uh, better, uh, there will be, uh, one that would show the alignment,",
            "Just one more thing PERSON13. If you could repeat one comment just now in the You said, you will, you will fix it yourself, or I will fix or I should fix it?",
            "Which one?",
            "The last one you put just few minutes ago.",
            "The the PROJECT2's? No, no, I will fix it. I will fix that.",
            "Okay, okay. Thank you.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The other one you asked me. Is the wording right? It was I will double check it.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "PERSON13, please could you add, add acc, my PROJECT3 account to the PROJECT12 test set and the? Yes, I will do it immediately. I'm surprised if you still do not have that access",
            "That's a good news PERSON13. I think from the 5th of January they",
            "The restrictions are over.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, okay. So where is that? Oh, I need to log in. That is why I do not see that. I hope it's this one, um. Okay, so settings. So this PROJECT12 test set. Manage access, uh, invite. So please tell me, what was that. Zarivar or PERSON2?",
            "Yes, Zarivar. Zarivar, yes. Yes, 29 and 28. Yeah, I 'm sharing the screen. So please check, right?",
            "Yes, it's correct.",
            "Write permission.",
            "And also, on On, uh, maybe on PROJECT6 also, so I can do that.",
            "I will do also PROJECT12 evaluation so you can see the outputs.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Actually PERSON13. So we will finish this. And after all of this, I will send you an email, because I think I, maybe I might be not available in January to the first of February. for example, for PERSON2. And also, he is waiting for some feedback from other people for, uh, this censorship or something like that in their pipeline.",
            "Oh, well, do not wait. Uh, push, push the people to do the job, and also try to integrate it yourself. So here I'm adding you also to PROJECT7.",
            "It is it is the name of a lake, this Zarivar.",
            "Okay, I didn't know.  And PROJECT7. There is also these data converters. That something which we have not published, but it could be useful. Oh, that is too bad. What? Why? It is not why it is so slow? And then do you already have access? So you have to click yes to all the emails. So actually, it just occurred to me that I'll probably also add you simply to ORGANIZATION9 teams. Where is that teams.  And with this, you should, uh, uh.",
            "Yeah, maybe you can add me there too if I'm not.",
            "Are you not? You are. Yes, you are here.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, so that that should be good. Ah, so, uh, please like get in touch with PERSON16 and PERSON7 and try to integrate the profanity filtering yourselves. So try to get the pipeline running for yourself and try to put it in there, because PERSON16 is busy. And it it would take more time. If you did it. It would be faster. We will get to the result faster. Ok, so that is I 'm. I 'm stopping to the sharing now, right? And I 'm going to work on the paper. And hopefully I will know everything already.",
            "Okay, so I'm rushing to my dentist. See you later.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Okay, thank you. Bye, bye.",

            "Yeah, uh, I I guess so. PERSON10 was about to join because he told me that he wants to be in the meeting. Because there are some decision points from his end. So, I had been in, in communication with him for two days. Like, there are already a chain of emails.",
            "Yes, yes, he is writing a lot of emails today. Also, I have also got around three or four.",
            "Oh, okay okay, okay.",
            "He was just was a way for the for for Christmas holidays now. And uh, whatever else And today today.",
            "Uh, yeah can you, can you drop PERSON10 your message over the phone that we are already online.",
            "Okay, okay, I can. Uh, he is here already.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I'm writing you a mail. Hi.",
            "Yeah, hi. Okay. I was running little bit Sorry I was caught in another call. Ah, yeah, ah.",
            "Hi.",
            "Hello.",
            "So, uh, I'm I'm happy to see you. Uh, both of you. Is, uh Are others also joining, or you don't know yet?",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah. That's that's that's okay. So you are, you are the",
            "For others you mean Yeah, uh. The others you mean",
            "I guess PERSON13.",
            "On our regular calls, yeah, it is PERSON13. I don't think PERSON7 was joining us.",
            "Yeah.",
            "For quite a few times, so yeah.",
            "So what, what we have to discuss today? I, um, I , I reviewed the webpage. Uh, uh, and I don't know if you have highlighted the portions of the document with the colourful papers.",
            "Oh, I.",
            "Never mind. I didn't have the free minute since then so don't worry.",
            "Okay.",
            "And, uh, uh, then I I'm really worried about PERSON7 if he can actually help us or not. Because, I, uh. Like, I think he might have started some PhD somewhere or or whatever. So he he may be actually much more busy then then we would be hoping for. So it's possible that.",
            "Yes, he was about to move to Canada I think.",
            "Yeah. So, that, that will not make our lives easier, but well we have to work with this. Uh, that means that we will lose a pe, the person to prepare the data. So, I was curious how far did PERSON7 get. And that's probably something that PERSON4 should know, right?",
            "Uh, he sent me a list of named entities. I have partly did it myself and partly the annotator.",
            "Mhm.",
            "And he didn't reply. And now after this Christmas holiday, during the holidays I didn't address him but now I see that he is not going to finish it because he stopped. Didn't respond.",
            "Stopped responding. Uh. Please.",
            "And probably. Uh, I will just probably finish it myself. And. But it's.",
            "But, but, but Well, finish. You will finish the annotation.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So the annotator has stopped or PERSON7 has stopped. Who, who",
            "Annotator has stopped.",
            "Annotator stopped, okay, yeah, so, uh, so if you, see, if it is an online document If you see that the annotator has stopped.",
            "He didn't do anything. He just didn't finish it. I've to him and it's an online document so I see that he didn't do it.",
            "Okay, so, that is good that you can finish it yourself, so, please do so. So, so, we can move, uh, forward. And, then, um, uh, get in touch with PERSON7 and double check that he would be able, uh, to do the processing, uh, also at the token level. Uh, so this annotation was done at the type level, like word types. And, uh, we need to do the second round for many of the words, uh, the annotators You and the annotator should have indicated, that it depends on the context. And for these context dependent, uh,",
            "Uh, I don't understand at all what you are talking about.",
            "Yeah, so this is something, that I wanted to also",
            "write it down. Somehow, somewhere. So, I will not be able to transfer all this information to PERSON7. I try to So I have. It will get lost somewhere in the middle. I will open the agenda now and will send you the link so we can write it down.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "I think I should also take note of this.",
            "Uh, um, we can write it to the agenda if we can find it. It must be somewhere.",
            "We can actually put it to the to the master plan, uh for the Um, um first shared task on automated minuting. Timeline, so we could put it into the shared task components, or we could put it to your agenda, whatever you like better.",
            "So this is the agenda.",
            "So, uh, PERSON4 the ma The agenda is in the master document so if you can check the Coffee Meetings.",
            "Uh, uh, uh, okay so I've forwarded it now to",
            "Okay.",
            "Virtual Coffee agenda. So am I in the correct one?",
            "And the last is this from the middle of December?",
            "Yes, yeah. So I 'm here as well.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So five",
            "0 eight So I thought, I know that I have discussed this with PERSON7. And I 'm not sure if we have written this anywhere or not. So this is like, get in touch with PERSON7. That is the short thing. But if he is not responding, then, like we have to",
            "Recreate it, uh, ourselves. Yeah, uh, yeah. Deidentification, uh, procedure. So there is a stages.",
            "I'll be back in thirty seconds.",
            "Yeah, yeah, I'll I'll write the here. Uh, so collect, uh, candidates for, uh, Annotate at word type level. Candidates without context, if they are surely a named entity. Uh, are uh, cannot be a named entity. And a NE uh, uh, in context, um, our context. And dependant then, mhm, um, insert type level annotations into xml markup of the documents. Mm, collect token level. Um, um, well, instances for annotation. Annotate at word token candidates in context of the sentence, or perhaps in, um, each occurrence. Uh, um, um or perhaps well. Uh, exactly as the. This is in full documents if, uh, that particular instance is an NE is not ,uh, an NE, and then insert token level annotations again into the same xml PROJECT3 documents. Uh, so. Uh, at this point. Uh, the documents will, um, contain information like, uh, this word was once, uh, was suspected to be an NE, but at the the words type, uh, annotation it was, uh, marked, uh, as a regular word.",
            "Uh, this word was suspected NE marked clearly as an NE in word type annotation. This word was suspected, an NE marked as unclear at type level. Uh, not processed at token level yet, and then, uh, marked as an E at token level, right? So this is not complete, but it illustrates that we want to have the, uh, uh, the finest possible detail about the annotation process. So we need to know exactly what has been touched by people with what result? I'm saying that this, uh, uh, the process, is documented to the finest level. I'm not saying that the distinct decisions are made to the finest level. That is a different thing. So we may be unsure about the particular instances being or not being entities. But we, we, we always must be sure about the fact, whether someone has processed this or not. .",
            "Sure.",
            "So do you do you understand? PERSON4, you look puzzled so.",
            "Partly.",
            "Yeah.  So, but, but PERSON9 have you read the process? And is, is that easy to follow?",
            "No, I think I need to see an example.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "I'm really like.",
            "Uh, yeah, yeah, uh. So, uh, thanks PERSON4 for the link. Uh, to the uh, annotation maybe a rename that document, so it should not be a copy of. But it should say something like, uh, annotation at the type level and and and so on.",
            "This is copy, because PERSON7 has made the annotations to the same file. And that he wanted to name it. So the idea was, uh, well. But we can rename it.",
            "Okay, he doesn't want to rename it. Uh, if it is, uh, if it is agreed, then.",
            "He, he asked me to make a copy of his document not to delete the lists so so.",
            "That is, uh, good.",
            "Accidentally not to move the information.",
            "But yeah, yeah, uh, I, I just would like the name to be more descriptive for someone so it.",
            "Okay.",
            "Like the the word copy, is okay. Like it. But it has to, uh, be this this copy of that is, is, like, just an automatic what uh, what, happens, if if you make a copy, uh, okay.",
            "This is better now. Proper nouns.",
            "Proper nouns and personal copy of PERSON4 or whatever. That's Like the word copy is good but this copy od is just automatic what, uh, what that happens if you make a copy.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay, well, so the idea, uh, is, uh, at the end we need to have the full collection of all our documents with all named entities replaced by place holders. We agreed some time ago, uh, that. You should find out the notes on this, uh, that we will stick to the name tech hierarchy. Perha perhaps even a simplified one. Uh, so that we do not go into the details of types of the named entities. So the least possible detail. For some of the entities, uh, like ,uh, names of months. We will plan to do them later because they are closed set. Very, very simple ones to, uh, to do. Uh, but they should also be like documented. So the process of the named entity removal has to be very clean, and we have to know at what stage of this process we are. So this would be, uh, the, the small, uh, closed set.",
            "Uh, things that they will be handled separately, and they are easy to do. The hard part are the entities which, uh, uh, like are normal names or project names or words, which can be names and may not be names at times. And we need this process to be like as fast as possible. Um, uh, so that's why I suggested to proceed at the two levels, first at the word type level, and then at the word token level. So that is the standard distinction from lexicographers work types and. .",
            "Maybe I don't understand this entire world type level. What is the difference?",
            "Yeah. So a word type is the word as it appears in the dictionary. And word token is a particular instance of the word in a running text in in the running text.",
            "So that is the first way. And now we are working on types, because I just see the words.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "And after that, we will once more do something with contexts.",
            "Yes, exactly. So we do want to have the annotation of the documents. So that we do want the token level annotation in the end. But some words like Jan or some clear names like it would be totally a waste of time to to do them a token by token, so we can do these words all at once. So that is the word type annot, or word type level annotation. This is this this the terms from lexicography. So that's, professor mentioned that the word type",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "and word token in in one of the early seminars. So maybe maybe you are too advanced, and then those those basic seminars.",
            "That's. It is. It's okay. I just could not have tried. Well, I needed to connect it to work, so.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so I 'm not sure if we will have PERSON7. Uh, uh, and he was supposed to be the system operator. To do like the bulk processing of the documents and the insertion of the annotations into the Xml and things like that. So that is some programmer's skill that If if PERSON7 is is not available, that will be like seriously in need off. So that's that's what worries me somewhat.",
            "Especially if PERSON7 will be away.",
            "Yes.",
            "It means that we are doing now is. Actually, I do not really need to finish the annotation, because this is some procession that's.",
            "No, no ,no ,no, no. Ah, like, uh, someone can pick it up from that point.",
            "Ah, okay, well, I don't understand the code.",
            "So that is not a",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "That's not a problem like, uh, you have, uh, what you are doing is, is, the, manual, decisions, that's the value.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Uh, like then, uh, creating such a list again, uh, it is very easy. Uh, there could be some small mismatches when there is, uh, like toke pancreatian marks. Uh, but uh, otherwise in vario. In most cases in in ninety nine percent of cases these tokens, the particular things that you have in the list, they will appear in the list for everyone, whoever does it. So these distinsti. These decisions that you make then could be easily transferred an restored. So that’s good. So, uh, uh, this collection of candidates that was done by PERSON7. Uh, at the stage where the documents, uh, were when he did it. And the annotation is still proceeding. And new documents are still coming, I guess.",
            "Well, it is really very. It has very bad quality, everything of that. First of all, there are a lot of typos.",
            "Mhm.",
            "I'm getting into the list so ORGANIZATION11 once written with M once written with N, once written with MN and so on. once written with",
            "Mhm.",
            "Remember. Yeah, so this is, the the typos in named entities are mainly because the people do, the annotators not knowing the correct spelling.",
            "Yes, yes. So I'm just saying that when I'm looking through the list there are a lot of different words, really. I don't know.",
            "Yeah, that's, uh, uh.",
            "Dozens and dozens.",
            "Yes.",
            "And then, also most of the output is not a named entity. Eighty percent is not a named entity.",
            "Yes, that's because there was, uh, probably beginnings of sentences. So all of, uh, the words at the beginning of sentences, uh, also got into the list. This could have been, better if name tag was used. Uh, and I I'm not sure. I think that PERSON7 did not use name tag because he needed to collect this list quicker.",
            "Yes.",
            "Uh, the, uh, the, student, uh, PERSON12. He used name tag so there is, uh, quite a big chance that if PERSON12 creates this list, it would be shorter. Uh, it would not include, uh, named entities that like. It would not suspect all beginnings of words to be named entities.",
            "Yes. And also the multi word ones.",
            "The multi word ones are also a problem.",
            "Yes. And they are connected. So, if you have World War II, you, you, you will have three words and and, well.",
            "Yeah, so this, mhm, mhm. Uh, this I'll say stages and then Uh, after that, uh, un, uh, or remaining or open problems. Open problems, uh, and one of the open problems is the edition of new documents. Another big problem is, uh, multiword NEs. These are even.",
            "And I don't think it inclu. The proble. I don't think that the program included all the words beginning from cPROJECT4tal. Because there are, uh, there are really, uh, not so many, not so many.",
            "Mhm.",
            "I'm not really sure that he has included all the all this stuff in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, well, uf, uf, uf. Final checks, uh, How do we ensure nothing, uh, leaks, uh, into the final data. How do we ensure no NE leaks into the final data. And uh, uh. Open problems will also be this closed lists. Months, uh, names, uh, of of days in the week. Yeah, uh and uh, what I want to say, as the last stage is, uh, the actual deno. Uh, so replacement of a? Well, actually there need not be a replacement, but like the, like, the actual actual removal of the original text, uh, from the documents. Leaving, uh, just the Xml markup to indicate. Here was an NE of this type, right?",
            "Mhm.",
            "And what is an unresolved problem as the identity of NEs, um, preservation and now well. Coreferencing, co Coreferencing of chains, including, uh, the identity of, uh, the individual speakers. So we can for the for the summarization. I think it is important to know who said what. And when someone referred to someone else. Uh, we do want to hide the original name of the person. But we do want to ideally we do want to keep that this was like PERSON11 and PERSON4. And then PERSON11 addressed PERSON4, and and so on.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So we, uh, probably do not need to. Uh, it would be better also to preserve the identity of project names or or whatever.",
            "Mhm.",
            "But I think it's. We really need to focus on persons. And we can, for the sake of time, ignore the identity or tracing of the identity of projects. For projects and other things we can say like",
            "Maybe sometimes in can't be added. If the annotators already deidentified, they didn't know who is who so the labels can be A, B, C and so on. And within in the text it will never be the same C, it will be varied.",
            "Yeah, that's okay. There can be errors. This is, uh, there could be data swaps. I don't think that the data set for the purposes of summarization will suffer much if we if we.",
            "Yes, I agree. Yes agreed.",
            "If we like mess up people.",
            "Yes agreed.",
            "We might afford tracing, uh, other people who are only mentioned, uh, in the, uh, in the ext and uh, not, uh, taking part in the meeting. So, uh, what I 'm saying by this is that if someone refers to PERSON11. PERSON11 is not not a speaker in this meeting, and someone refers to PERSON11 at the top of the meeting, and someone else refers to PERSON11 at the end of the meetings.",
            "It will be the same being.",
            "We can afford to ignore, uh, that that tracing. We don't have to discuss whether this is the same PERSON11 or different PERSON11. We can say there was some person in the top. There was some person at the end. And that is the same, like checking if PERSON6. Is this PERSON6 or different PERSON6? So we do not have to do this type of annotation. We, we, I, I suggest that we ignore it. We do it only for the speakers, if we can.",
            "How do we know if this is the speaker or not.",
            "Well, if we don't, we don't never mind.",
            "Mhm. Because actually, if the labels of",
            "Yes, if the labels are A, B, C, that is what you said. Let's leave it like. Let's leave it non linked.",
            "Mhm.",
            "That's, that's okay. So actually, our main worry is that some true named entity will leak into the data. Our lower or less important worry is whether we preserve the identities. And I'm happy to do errors in the second part, but I would be very unhappy to do errors in the first part.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Yeah, so this is the outline. And we need to put this outline on a time frame.",
            "And person frame.",
            "And person frame, Yes, so get in touch with PERSON7 and check if this is what was discussed with him. And maybe it's it's in some document with him. I 'm not sure. Um, so please get in touch with him and extract from him the information if if he can do this for us. And if not, then we have to do this ourselves. And in that case, that probably falls on PERSON9 for the programmer parts, I'm I'm afraid. So that means that you may need to offload some of your , uh, the what modelling ideas or to PERSON13.",
            "Mhm.",
            "We still have time. I'm not like so worried like I could I could deidentify this. If I had a week of, uh, uh. If I could lock myself in a sanctuary for a week, then I think I will have anonymised the corpus myself. Like it's it's not to. If you do, you do it with clever text editors and and combining scripting and all that it's. Our data set is not too big.",
            "Yes.",
            "It's it's doable.",
            "Yeah, I think I think like I'm not, uh, like certain minutings are still not clear to me. I will have a session with PERSON4 with the data. How like? What is the imput and what should look like? Once, I have that, then then it would be easier for me.",
            "So what I'm thinking of is, for example, for the token level annotation. If I was doing it myself. If if if I locked myself for that week, it would be a few via macros, and I would be just hitting F one, F two, F one, F two, F one, F two. And that would be the token of annotation. And it would be done for a document like very quickly. So, it is, uh, I I 'm, not so much worried. Uh, I think, it's doable. Uh, but it has to be a skilled person in in this, ah, like text processing. It's a special type of text processing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so that's the deidentification procedure. What is equally important is the deidentification guidelines. And potentially some new concerns will be added, like after PERSON4 discusses this with PERSON14. So, this is now my question on PERSON4. Whether you have already dates set on when to talk to or call or meet PERSON14. So please.",
            "Nothing.",
            "Plea, please do plan something.",
            "Well, PERSON14 is working on our deidentification from the beginning of January or?",
            "Yes. Yesterday actually. I told her yesterday that she should start. So she.",
            "And she has time and she",
            "Uh, well she will have to make the time for that. So she is till on number of of projects and, uh, and. But I really think that, uh, .",
            "So what should I. So what d you mean? She needs to do what? Yes.",
            "She needs to read the regulations. That will take her some time.",
            "About how to deidentificate it?",
            "About what is present data. So we do not know exactly. I do not know what exactly this person laid up.",
            "So she has to decide what should be actually anonymised.",
            "Yes, kind of. The way that I set it in the procedure that we discussed here that is based on my intuition. But I, I could",
            "So she has to say, if we have to delete also the names of languages.",
            "For example.",
            "Well, so this is one of our basic questions. So this is actually very. I would be very happy if we leave it. If we don't anonymise it.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Leave English, German, Czech and don't mix it up. Because it is at least some information that could be preserved in the minutes. So actually, if we have some, well.",
            "We can always do mock named entities. So, for example, for the languages, we can shuffle it. And we would say Romanian instead of French in all cases?",
            "Yes, okay, of course. But once one more thing. That we should align the transcript with the minutes.",
            "Yes, that has to be done this. The identification has to be done on both, of course.",
            "On the same way, so that we",
            "Exactly the same way. So when I 'm talking about a document. I mean, either the transcript or any version of the minutes.",
            "Mhm okay.",
            "Uh.",
            "So we. So you have multiple versions of minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "So a document is either the transcript or any any minute version for that particular meeting.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So document is any text, uh, in the collection that is very important. I like, it seems natural to me. But we. We must not forget about this.",
            "So one question I have like. So this should be done especially on the PROJECT1 data, right? So we don't need to do this on ORGANIZATION6?",
            "No, not at all. So do you feel that not at all? ORGANIZATION6 doesn't go through this at all.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, back to PERSON14. Uh, I'm waiting for PERSON4 to finish.",
            "I'm just writing it to.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh, back to ,uh, PERSON14. So, please get in touch with her as soon as possible. And, uh, agree on a timeline with her. So she will definitely need some time on, uh, reading for, for reading the the regulations. The key word indeed is the personal data. She needs to tell us what exactly is persons data. And all person's data must be removed. Absolutely removed, the data set needs to be free of personal data.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Uh, that. She is like She will have various concerns. We we need to like discuss with her, what is what is the strategy. So that, from that , uh, discussions. From her survey of of the regulations the guidelines will follow. The guidelines will be the result. And the guidelines will say something like person's name must not appear in in that. And we will then check if the procedure that we are already running is in line with that or if anything else needs to be included in the procedure. So so that the guidelines are satisfied.",
            "I think that these are not personal data. Things like months and languages.",
            "Yes, I agree that these are not personal, uh, uh, data. But she should check. Like kind of think about it.",
            "Mhm.",
            "Yeah, so, so that's the guidelines. And uh, uh, yeah. Please PERSON4 agree on a timeline, exactly. So I think that the, uh, the annotation can go independently. And there will as last resort, there could be like a secondary or tertiary or or final annotation stage. Where we would be still removing something which, like, we haven't thought of and PERSON14 has found it out.",
            "You mean the annotation of what?",
            "The. When I say annotation now I mean deidentification.",
            "Yeah, okay. Mhm, mhm, mhm.",
            "Yeah, so. And then, the other thing that PERSON4 needs to discuss with PERSON14, uh, is the consent forms. So that we do it.",
            "So that is something totally different.",
            "that is something totallly different. Uh, it's very closely related but, uh, explain.",
            "But this is what PERSON14 actually doesn't know at the moment.",
            "Uh, I sent an email to her this morning mentioning these two things. She kind of was expecting this. So, so we've discussed this before. So it is not that.",
            "Because I have also shown her many times this consent forms. This is totally new.",
            "Mhm.",
            "And she will demand for kind of piece of that type too.",
            "Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah. With this, we are in some time pressure. But not any worse time pressure than a month ago. Uh.",
            "So we have to decide how. What should be included, yes,",
            "What should be the wording of the consent form.",
            "Mhm.",
            "And there are two types to, like, two stages of the content forms. This is new compared to the beginning of the project. Where we thought we would have only one consent form. Now we have two consent forms. The first one is, uh, the one that we are using. Uh, uh, where people like, give us the permission to work with the data. And we need primarily now the second one. And the second one is we are getting the permission to publish the data in the the deidentified form.",
            "So it means that we should kind of forget everything that we did before and do again from the ze, from zero. The first constant form created, which agrees with, uh, kind of working with our data. And then, uh, create a second consent form. Uh, about publishing.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And give all the participants of all meetings, both consent forms of the same time at the same time.",
            "No, no, no. So actually we do not need to redo the the first page.",
            "We do, because we have we have we have",
            "Yeah.",
            "Kind of, our consent form. Our existing consent forms are about publishing actually, mostly.",
            "Yes, but they are not, uh, but they are not perfect. And people didn't and they are.",
            "Of course, they are not perfect.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And they are signed by thirty percent of participants.",
            "Yeah, that's that's the problem. So, people who have not really signed those. Uh, uh, we are processing their data without having recived their consent. Hopefully they will give us their consent now. So yes.",
            "Mostly we proceed their data with their oral consent.",
            "Yes. That's good. So that's. So yeah. So we have at least that.",
            "And. So I would now, with PERSON14, I would focus on the second form which is the consent to publish the data. And this, uh, consent, uh, will be complimented with samples. So, ideally every person would have all the meetings that he was taking part in. He could browse them and check himself if he is still represented in that or not. It would be leady this deidentified. So he should not be able to, l uh, uh, like feel identified. But he would know the the content. So that's.",
            "So why not to forget about the first phase, in this case.",
            "Yes, so let's. Uh, let's totally ag. Like forget about the first form for the purpose of the release of the corpus. And let's come to the first form only once the corpus is finished and released. And let'ss do this first form for the new meetings that we will still be collecting even after that. So I. That I was my proposal as well. Let us really focus on the second form now. Uh, to have the permission to publish the data in the anonymous form. And and later come to the first form again, because we will still be reaching out. And trying to get more people, provide us with meetings, and there and there we will need the the first form. And the first one will be on the content to process the data and deidentify it with the forcing goal of publication. When people will be asked with the second form again.",
            "Mhm well, I'm just thinking about this, uh, samples.",
            "Yeah. If Uh, so with um kind of preli, openly said, if we really need all these samples for people we are sure about, like you and me, PERSON9 and so on. So, er, should.",
            "We can simplify it also by, uh, like giving everybody the full dataset. Access to the full data set like brows this.",
            "Should probably be this in a consent form. So I'm kind of. I am a little bit lost in what should be done.",
            "So.",
            "So really should prepare the special examples for every consent for every participants. It appears to be the task for the whole year. And I",
            "Um, well, no. It is a little bit of programming and a little bit of evidence, like, who was in meeting of what?",
            "Yes but neither me nor PERSON14 will never do that.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah sure.  Yeah, yeah. I understand, that there is, uh, there could be, uh, a substantial amount of administration so to say. Or data ma management. Uh, uh, for this, which can be skipped. And the easiest way I see to skip is to prepare the data set fully deidentified already. As a simple directory with documents which people could browse.",
            "And give a link.",
            "And give a link. And people could open these. And then in the. You would like tell, sent everybody the consent form. So here is the consent for for you. You need, uh, to to get your permission to, uh, to publish the the data. You have been a participant of a meeting of these days. or something like that. So people could find themselves.",
            "Mhm.",
            "If they want to check specifically themselves. And they would be also avail, allowed to to browse any of that data.",
            "So we will do that, or not.",
            "Uh, so I think this is like a prerelease of the corpus. So as soon as we have the corpus, clean, uh, removed the named entities. Uh, it is a matter of like a putting it in a directory, wrapping it in a Html uh, or, or, , uh, any any browsable format. So that is very simple. And I think PERSON9 would do that in ,uh, in two hours. Uh, so the the the preparation of the web page. Uh, that people can browse.",
            "Aha, so.",
            "What is what is the the tedious part is ,uh, the ,uh, the linking which person was mentioned where. So this meta data that is.",
            "Yes, this is what I'm asking about.",
            "Uh, this should be, uh, I hope that this is in your directory structure somewhere. That you like know who was participant of what meeting.",
            "Uh, not about all of them. Definitely. I have just made a sample.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Uh, to make it manually it is a very big task. What I.",
            "Is it? Okay, can you?",
            "What I it can probably automatically extract is from is to extract the names of participants from meeting minutes.",
            "Yes yes that is.",
            "Created by annotators.",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Yes and but sometimes this is.",
            "Incomplete.",
            "You have to incomplete and the names are incorrect. And you have to some some others. And some people that the person, the annotator.",
            "Yeah, so that's. I think, uh, uh, the, the. Let's do the best effort thing. The best effort is to. Like, if you have an annotator who could review this. If you know that the meeting participants information could be improved, corrected by someone. One of your annotators. Uh, if you have like items which, where you specifically know that this is missing or something like that. Some manual effort could be invested there. But even if we don't do this, let's just collect it from the meeting minutes. The list of participants. And then we will say in the content, content, consent form based on. Oh, I forgot to record this meeting, is that a problem?",
            "No, you are recording it.",
            "It is already recording I guess.",
            "Is it? That's good. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "You would never forget it.",
            "Yeah. So even if we don't do this manual refinement of the participants. We have some information on that. And with the consent form sent to PERSON11 or PERSON8 we will say",
            "So, this is.",
            "I think we can, Uh, what we can do is, like we create a master sheet. Then we extract the name of participants from each of the minutes.",
            "Yes.",
            "And give that the, to all of them. Like",
            "Yes.",
            "Please, please see, uh, and check.",
            "Find yourself, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, so that's like a .",
            "That would be much easier.",
            "I think this is. Yeah, I don't think the the stay, the extra step of cutting out the extra portion of the master sheet is too tedious. I think it's it's doable. It's it's kind of mail merge. So, uh, uh, a mail merge operation. So you you like prepare personalised emails.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It's it's not too bad. It's it is a little bit of work extra. I will leave it up to you what do you find, uh, like the the balance between your labour and and their labour. What is polite and what, uh, what is laborious. I 'll leave that up to you.",
            "Yeah, so once we have, once we have the meeting IDs and these are the partcipants so like, uh, we can easily find to which ID belongs which participant. And then.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That is. That should be easy.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "That should not take much time to do.",
            "And then, uh, kind of separately of the consent form. We should ask people for bug reports. So this is, this is a big value. When we are sending the people again the links. And when we, uh, know that people will be again opening these files, every gaze to that It's crowd It's like, it's crowd sourcing essentially. Every gaze into the data set gives us an opportunity to spot other things that should have been anonymised. So they need to have a place where they would record, uh, these, uh, extra observations.",
            "Okay.",
            "And then we would do a second pass. If there. We will see, maybe there will be no more, uh, outstanding pieces of information that need to be deleted, but maybe they will. And then we will do like a second pass of the data. And then remove these final things and and release it.",
            "Yes, so I think uh what you are suggesting PERSON10 is like instead of the master sheet, we could We keep one master sheet, but we keep well from the masters. It will. We create the individualized sheets",
            "And they will have the remarks. Yeah.",
            "That is like a purpose They will have remarks, they will have, they would have the remarks.",
            "Yes.",
            "Will have the remarks column with colour and based on that, we will refine it.",
            "Yes. So just please put this on a timeline. We should have a sample document, uh, one meeting or two meetings at most. Ideally, uh, at the end of January. So that we can put it online as to the prospective participants of the task at the beginning of February. This is something that I suggested in in an email to PERSON9 this morning.",
            "Yes.",
            "And we need to have the full thing, was it end of March?",
            "16?",
            "Um.",
            "Or 16 of March at the full dataset.",
            "A trial data is16 March but training data first April.",
            "Probably, yeah. So end of March. Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So please put this deidentification procedure and this check with the consents on the time scale. So I think that, uh, end of February.",
            "I think we should.",
            "End end of February would be a good date for the participants, for the meeting participants, to uh, to get their consents, right? Would that make sense. I think it's doable for us in those kind of two months to have almost finished the deidentification. And.",
            "March, April. Yes, I think I think two months would be great.",
            "Two months for us are good and then one month for them to answer. So they would. They should answer within a week. Uh, and we would have three weeks to to finish it. And there is like, uh, a little bit of time soul to handle any issues.",
            "So we write the data deidentification from the participants by February end.",
            "Uh, sorry, say it again. In full words and full sentences.",
            "Yeah, so the data deidentification consent from their end should be done by, uh, February end.",
            "Uh, no was the. We have to have the data ready for them to browse. So if we are able to have the data for them by mid February, then I would agree with you. I'm a little bit concerned about it. I think that we will have the data at the end of February, and they should then do the consent. Uh, in the first week of February, or something like that?",
            "Okay.",
            "Sorry. First week of March.",
            "March.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Mhm okay. And so so talking about the timeline, what should be the time in line for this total task. Like for the deidentification.",
            "Yeah, well it depends on whether we have PERSON7 or not. That that will also like affect the timing, I believe. But I think that PERSON4 will be finished with the work type level annotation, uh, well, in two days.",
            "Yes, I have written that I will do till tomorrow.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So it is. So, uh,.",
            "So it's it doesn't take It's like thousand and a half maybe.  It takes two hours or something.",
            "Yeah. So then we need the coding of the Xml. Which is item three, and then again, item six. Items three can be kind of delayed if if inevitable. But it would be better to do it so that you can also you already use this. Uh, uh, the Xml mark up to to find, uh, uh, uh to extract the token level instances, um? So I think that the exact timing really depends here on who is doing that. And ,uh, the actual remover of the original, uh text from the document. So the six, six and seven. This should not happen later than in mid February.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So I'll put it in here. This, uh, should not happen later. Or this or this. This should happen, uh, by the end of by the mid of February at the latest.",
            "Where do you write it?",
            "Just as a comment to that, to point six and seven.",
            "Aha, aha okay.",
            "So put it elsewhere. Uh, uh",
            "No, it's just in the agenda document I didn't see that. Okay, now",
            "Yeah. Okay, so is that it? Or is there anything else we need to discuss.",
            "Well, there is a lot of things, I think. PERSON9 has created a lot of different things during Christmas holidays.",
            "The the web page. I like the webpage.",
            "The only thing I'm not sure I don't like this changing very quickly.",
            "That's modern. PERSON4, you are too old. Ignore that. I also hate it.",
            "I wanted to read it and it disappears.",
            "Just just like, close your eyes for that.",
            "Okay, so I will, I will increase the timer. So, don't worry.",
            "Yes, yes please.",
            "Probably, yeah.",
            "Yeah.  Okay.",
            "And maybe one will thing, as you created the Scientific Committee. Why did you include all the Russians, all the Russians in the in here. So actually, I'm not sure should be in the Scientific Committee. You, they do not even know about that. They are probable participants.",
            "No, it is. It is just.",
            "This mock. Uh, or is that through.?",
            "So, it is not finalised. You know PERSON4.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "So, um, it is not finalised, as I have just put the names. Because, um, like.",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "If they are participating, so they could also be the potential reviewer. So they can review others work, right?",
            "That is right, yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "But we should probably ask them. So if you.",
            "Yes, yes. Definitely, definitely. So that is why I have forwarded you the email, right PERSON4. The email template that we would be sending to the.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, definitely.",
            "I did.",
            "If I. So I am kind of unsure of if we should invite all of these people to the Scientific Committee. Because more or half of them are master's students.",
            "I know I, I do not know. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, let's let's leave that open. But I . And I think master students should not be there really. It's it's at least PhD students.",
            "And I don't know who. And I, I don't know these people personally. So, I don't know who are master students. So this is kind of a special. Uh, um, somebody is an autumn. Somebody is already like a kind of assistant professor.",
            "That's out of That's clearly good. And PhD students.",
            "But they don't.  So it is a very special task to look through these people. And somebody of them have some ORGANIZATION2, some ORGANIZATION2, ORGANIZATION9's or something. And some of them do have it, but don't have it online. So, it's.",
            "Well I would suggest PERSON9 that you put this list down and you would just put to be determined or in preparation. In the in the Scientific Committee. Keep it elsewhere and we will like discuss it separately. Do we have to have the list for the application?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yes, yes, yes. That's the problem. Otherwise we could have done it later. This is needed for the application.",
            "Mhm.",
            "So then please prepare the text for an email to the prospective members of this.",
            "He already did.",
            "Where is that text.",
            "I have already done forward.",
            "Is it in the C, F, P, uh.",
            "I guess I, I emailed you like, maybe in December. But I didn't get a reply.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, that is my fault. So maybe can we paste it. So there is this ORGANIZATION10 and ORGANIZATION2 2021. Does the document with the C, F, P. Could we use the same document for, uh, editing the text of that, uh, email?",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh, so I'm forwarding it to you again. And you put a link there.",
            "Okay, yes, oh, sorry.",
            "And in the spreadsheet we keep track of whom it. Like who has it declined or accepted or in.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh. So for this work better, the more personal we write it, uh, the the better. So, uh, the the sheet where it is the ORGANIZATION9sheet. Uh, there is a second one right conf with the status. Okay, so please put all the candidates, uh, from the web page to this list and, uh, fill what you. Like do not spend too much time. The critical is the name and the email, and then obviously the status. But I would add one more column. I'm now in the, uh, uh in this program Committee. Uh or let's let's let's call it Scientific Committee, right? Scientific Committee, so that we have the same language. I'm now on the ORGANIZATION9Sheet, uh, that you will created. I don't see you the PERSON9 there? Are you there or not? Left. Oh well, contact ,uh, him her. So PERSON9 I have now added column F in the ORGANIZATION9sheet.",
            "And I suggest that we divide the people. Uh, so that we invite them personally, if possible. .",
            "Okay.",
            "So the invitation email will be personalised in some way. So let's, let's in this ORGANIZATION9document, with the invitation email. Make several copies, uh, uh, individualized in in various ways, and I will contact some, and you will contact some and PERSON4 will contact the Russian ones. Perhaps we will get even more. And.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's, uh, we really have to do it, uh, today, right? Because we need to.",
            "Yes.",
            "Need to, uh, have this information in ten days?",
            "No, I I I would propose that we submit the proposal within the January seventh or eight.",
            "Oh.",
            "Oh, okay.",
            "Ouch.",
            "Yeah, yeah, you have to be more insistent on getting information from me. Like December is hard. But I should have not left this, uh, uh, unattended for two weeks.",
            "So the thing is, so the thing is like. PERSON10 we have to just submit the proposal because a scientific committee is not, will be fixed. So, uh, like like, like the people we know, they will quickly give us consent, right? Like from the PROJECT1 project itself. So.",
            "Well, there are people from a list. So let's. Can you put their names in the, uh, in the ORGANIZATION9sheet. So that we can.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So, yeah, because I I actually want to cancel some. For example, this PERSON5 and others. From ORGANIZATION3 I don't expect anyone to be in any good position for, uh, serving on this. For example.",
            "Okay.",
            "So.",
            "So, uh, so, uh, PERSON10 can you just, uh, uh, tell me the names? I will then. Who do you want to see.",
            "Put them, or put all of them there, and I will delete the lines, or like cancel them like strike them out.",
            "Okay, okay. Mhm.",
            "Yeah.",
