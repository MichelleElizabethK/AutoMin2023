            "We can think that this is one of the respeakers, ehm, and ehm, we would like to switch the subtitles to present another source of that language.",
            "So if ehm several imput ehm Englishs, and we would like to switch ehm those.",
            "ehm yeah, so, everything is going  ehm so, ehm PERSON9 or PERSON8 can you please explain?",
            "Yes sure, ehm",
            "Yeah.",
            "The presentation platform available is not yet updated",

            "ehm, so, I hear your voice ehm interrupted at times.",
            "So I thought that for this check ehm we want you to do the switching ehm by killing off) thelines, and ehm using the ehm bridge ehm selecting different bridge ehm worker ehm starting up a different bridge worker and starting up the  ehm theline again.",
            "So the ehm different bridge would be  ehm would be used and the different path would be selected.",
            "Yes.",
            "For this  ehm for this check today, I wanted to ehm use the setup which you already worked in the past.",
            "Okay, sorry again and thank you.",
            "Yeah, so this  ehm this should we should be able to test this.",
            "So, maybe  ehm I'll just say ehm, so  ehm yeah, we're testing the old option, the ehm bridge workers to select the ehm",
            "Please ehm explain ehm whether the  ehm the planned behaviour for the next week.",
            "Yeah, so, so PERSON9 actually since you are here, ehm you were not here when I was ehm saying that Wednesday is also available for the full guesting) at ehm South Premises.",
            "When  ehm and I heard that you are coming, which is great.",
            "So, i is that true?",

            "Are you coming during Wednesday?",
            "So you will be hore  here only on Wednesday evening or even earlier?",
            "ehm, I don't",
            "I have to ask journey.",
            "Yeah, so, ehm so ehm as said, ehm Wednesday is surely available from the very morning and ehm Tuesday ehm afternoon is also extremely likely.",
            "So, if you come already at Tuesday lunchtime, we will make use of ehm all the ehm available ehm very well.",
            "So Tuesday lunchtime ehm would be already ehm sensible arrival, ehm if you can make it.",
            "Okay, I can ask you about",
            "Yeah,",
            "Okay, okay, I will ask you.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay, thank you.",
            "ehm yeah and than  ehm so, we'll do the testing ehm in the second, once  ehm once PERSON3 is  ehm is has put everything together and on ehm, and so on.",
            "What ow)  ehm what occured to me ehm as a usable thing is the various thing would be if all the interpreters int he four ehm booths would see ehm their ehm subtitles as the're being recognised.",
            "So for example now if I saw me, if I saw my own English among the  ehm on the subtitles, which, for some reason, does not ehm, yeah  oh okay, something is being updated and I don't see the actual words.",
            "So, I cannot ehm tune my pronunciation to improve  ehm to improve what is ehm being reco recognised or how do I  ehm how close am I to the microphone and and so on.",
            "So if we are able to ehm provide the interpretors with the immediate feedback, I believe the quality would be much ehm better.",
            "ehm for this, ehm, ORGANIZATION5 can bring ehm sufficient laptops, we'll somehow get them, I don't know, ehm wha have four but we will try.",
            "ehm but, we need ehm the setup to  ehm to be there.",
            "So, PERSON4, are you or on the call?",
            "PERSON4, PERSON4, are you here?",
            "Can you hear us?",
            "PERSON4, are you  here?",
            "So let's see if PERSON4 is here.",
            "I want you to doublecheck with PERSON4, ehm whether ehm the  ehm whether they can still ehm connect formal laptops to the Internet.",
            "Hello, hello.",
            "Yes, we can hear you.",
            "Great, so I am here.",
            "Yeah, so ehm, can you connect for more laptops to the Internet?",
            "I guess that should not be any problem.",
            "I guess it should not, but I don't know about the capacity of the switch, so, yeah, I should check.",
            "Yeah, so the idea is to  to have ehm notebooks also in the interpreters' booths, but we can run into physical limits, maybe there is not enough space on their desk and  and so on.",
            "ehm and but if we  if we succeed with the physical setup, ehm then ehm my idea is that ehm in the languages we would also have these ehm specific for ehm languages or ehm fake language labels, which would correspond to the ehm ASR ehm of the individual ehm booths ehm like ehm ride away.",
            "And ehm, I have not thought about the details, about the fingerprints, I  I let this to  ehm to PERSON3.",
            "What is my little worry is thay we will actually need yet another ehm for couple of ASR, the corresponding language ehm ASR workers.",
            "ehm but, if we can ehm do it in a different way, it would be better.",
            "So this is ehm like an idea and I would like that PERSON3 and  and ehm PERSON9 or  to discuss how to do this ehm, so that the ehm network load is  is not duplicated again.",
            "So this is ehm, pl please discuss this a if you say it's too complicated let's  let's give up on this.",
            "But, ehm, if  I thing it would",
            "My  my only wor worry is about, ehm let's say ehm, service languages like one two and so on.",
            "ehm, you will have  those service languages displayed also in the main page Yeah of presentation platform.",
            "And, so, also  an users will be ehm Yes allowed to choose one of them ehm, and I don't know if it's suitable or not.",
            "In  in my opinion, Yeah",
            "I think it's okay, I like I would not worry. Okay",
            "Ehm, maybe  maybe we can lang we can label these ehm special languages only with ehm numbers.",
            "ehm, so, ehm maybe call it like X1, X2, X3, X4.",
            "any idea?",
            "So  ehm so then, ehm no one would be likely to to choose it and if they discover and they were like to follow these ehm direct booth channels then why not.",
            "But, like it's not our problem.",
            "So these these are only the  the outputs from ASR?",
            "Yes, exactly.",
            "Okay.",
            "So the idea is  how to set up ehm like a little path out ehm from the main path, which goes through the translation ehm and all that.",
            "ehm the  the little path out directly to  ehm to the presentation platform.",
            "ehm Okay, so let's  let's move ehm forward ehm, so ehm a very ehm relavant thing ehm is that we would  we should ehm try o collect some feedback from the participants.",
            "ehm and w wes have only created but not  not yet populated ehm the feedback form.",
            "So if you have any ideas ehm what to ask, simply create a random questions we'll polish this.",
            "Obviously, we will not ehm aks this questions before we actually know how it works.",
            "ehm like if  if  if it  fails completely, there's no point in asking like Were you happy with translation quality polish ehm  so, we'll only ask ehm the questions that are relevant.",
            "So we'll keep updating this form as we go.",
            "ehm my main Well, actually, Yeah sorry I Yeah, yeah",
            "we have a lot of questions regarding the user interface, ehm Okay",
            "The fun functionalities and  you know there're two ehm maybe presentational platform more comfortable Great for the user.",
            "So we can  put a lot of questions regarding these parts.",
            "Yes, exactly, so k feel free to create a new section here or whatever.",
            "Though) into form modified as  as  as you like Okey and we'll organise a ORGANIZATION4 form anyone can edit ehm it and, ehm we'll finalise the content of the form actually on Wednesday I suggest.",
            "So that, ehm on  on Thursday we can give it to the participants.",
            "Thank you.",
            "so if anyone would like to know anything about their part, ehm, feel free to add such questions in a way that is understandable to  ehm like a  late users.",
            "Yeah, and ehm the last thing I wanted to mention is this ehm video, that we would like to record from  ehm from that, as you know the  the video form ehm the was quite successful at least for u for ourself, I think.",
            "ehm and, this time I have ehm a student jour journalist, a PhD. ehm student of journalism, so he should be the more skilled.",
            "We are still waiting for the confirmation from ORGANIZATION3, whether they have no objections ehm against this.",
            "ehm and, I think that PERSON4 will not know) today, I think that ehm ORGANIZATION3 finally decide ehm only on Monday.",
            "ehm, but ehm, anyway, I told the person ehm that ehm we would like, even if ORGANIZATION3) does not hello him to  to go to the premises, that we would still like to do it well outside of the building, or ehm at ORGANIZATION5, or wherever.",
            "So, this is  this is the ORGANIZATION4 document ehm which ehm would be then the content of the video.",
            "ehm and ehm these the journalist never know what to tell you, wh what they should ask, or ehm what what he should tell them, so actually it's up to us to  ehm to propose the propose the content.",
            "They  ehm they will then organise it in a nice way, but we need to ehm suggest what  what should appear in the video.",
            "So, please, if you have any ideas Sorry, just put them there. , okay.",
            "ehm, the problem is  ehm for the guy is to building or to recover  recall the inside it.",
            "ehm so well ehm the the person is avaiable and has the whole day ehm for us, ehm but ehm ORGANIZATION3 needs to approve that he can enter the building, which is  ehm which they probably allow without any problems, and that he can record and what he can record.",
            "ehm, I think there)  is many sensible ways ehm how he can record something and still not record any of the participants, ehm and not our inper iterpreters as well.",
            "And we would still like to see these parts of the video, ehm but ehm in general, ehm someone needs to confirm, that  that he can be there with the equipment.",
            "Okay, ehm please let us also know ehm if it's possible to record the) something inside the  the building, because ehm maybe ehm we  we can have) been providing recording by ourselves, at least some  ehm some scene of the situation and of the booth and and so on. Yes, exactly",
            "Yeah yeah, so ehm video what  what I  what I ehm also have is a  is a  like a regular camera, big one, that ehm I use ehm at the  ehm at the, ehm so, ehm I also well t try to  ehm get some material as a background, possible background ehm images.",
            "ehm but ehm obviously, someone has to be fine with that.",
            "Is  a  the  the room Yes, sure is not in the street regime, the  the room ehm, the lecture room, is you don't need an ID card to enter this room, ehich is different from the normal premises of ORGANIZATION3.",
            "So, if I  when I visit PERSON4 in his offices, I need to show my ID, they record and  and so on.",
            "ehm and  and they doublecheck that I don't have any knives, and ehm all the security gates.",
            "ehm but ehm, the  ehm the  presentation or the  the workshop room is a normal one.",
            "So it's  ehm it's easier to get ehm there and  but ORGANIZATION3 has to confirm that ehm they are fine with that.",
            "Okay, so Okay",
            "is not working, is it? ehm",
            "What is not working?",
            "ehm I am checking my microphone, because  I don't see my name like ehm, so I thought it was broken and now it's finally working We can hear you, we can hear you, okay. So, the thing is, ehm even with the interpreters, ehm there was this requirement ehm for the confidentiality or no disclosure, so I don't think it will be this easy to  get permission to record anything.",
            "Yeah, ehm so the idea is to record ehm like the setting and what we do there, so the wires) and an empty room, or ehm interpreter's booth or maybe to watch our participants, the  like the biggest thing would be to watch our participants from behind.",
            "ehm and ehm s like a maybe at some point, when there is nothing ehm interesting or w where the screen is actually not visible at all.",
            "And and the content of the  of what they are talking should not have be in the  in the video.",
            "So we can make ehm, maybe ehm, like ehm",
            "Yeah, and you will probably meet)  also someone disclosure for from the journalists, because he will be there, he will hear stuff.",
            "ehm That's right, so that we can  ehm we can ask him to sign the same thing as the interp you're right, okay.",
            "So we'll we'll figure this out.",
            "So this is  this is for PERSON1",
            "Can you email PERSON1, that ehm we need to have  because ehm what the journalist ehm we cannot simply say ehm that he followed ehm the ehm like code of conduct of interpreters.",
            "Because journalists have different codes of conduct.",
            "ehm so, ehm we'll  we'll have a nondisclosure agreement for  ehm for him as well.",
            "And we can also confirm  I guess the  the regime here is the same as  as with the interpreters.",
            "So it's us who confirms) to you, the ORGANIZATION3, that ehm they have signed this non agreement and they will not do any  ehm any bad thing.",
            "And it's our responsibility.",
            "So that's  that's not problem I hope so yeah.",
            "So that's  that's not a problem.",
            "But ehm please ehm since the time is ehm getting short please  ehm like ehm swiftly communicate any  ehm any concerns, ehm so that we can  ehm we can have him there and  and record it.",
            "So in the worse case Yeah, regarding concerns, yeah yeah",
            "There were even concerns from the participants that ehm the  thing the  things there will be talk  they will be talking about  will  be  ehm well, will leak too soon.",
            "So there are definitely concerns, with the.",
            "Okay.",
            "Okay, ehm s yeah, so well  I thing it's  ehm it's something that we all ehm can sign that we are not going to leak anything and that will be very ehm careful about the data and  all that, but  obviously, yeah you you have to decide.",
            "So  so  ehm I don't know, maybe  maybe some of the sessions should be like ehm close",
            "for us or  I don't know what  what the setup would be.",
            "Yeah, on okay.",
            "So  ehm so PERSON4, your  your microphone is now ehm very well ehm  we  we hear your typing frantically, I guess it's not  Not me, not me. not okay.",
            "So someone else ehm anyway, let's ehm",
            "Is it PERSON11?",
            "Not me.",
            "No  no, I don't know, we hear someone typing ehm very loud.",
            "yeah, okay, so let's get ehm the experiment running.",
            "ehm I am talking ehm, so I'll now  ehm I'm talking and I'm watching ehm the subtitles.",
            "ehm And, I'm not sure it's  if it's recognising what  ehm what I am saying.",
            "My softer lines of English Yes. is Yes, it's  it's recognising you.",
            "But what is being dispayed in the subtitles is totally wrong.",
            "So if you look at the subtitles it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
            "it was microphone but  I  I touched",
            "That's reasonable, I would say",
            "I  I will check what what does it listen to Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so maybe we have the problem with the input quality, which can happen ehm all the time",
            "No it's good.",
            "Yeah, so that's  ehm my voice correctly arise, so not French, Hungary, Italian, ehm Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Spanish",
            "So I have the  full set of subtitles, but I don't have  ehm I see only some messy German ehm and some Yes completely broken ehm English, so We still have only two English segmenters so we can run at most two languages at once.",
            "Oh, and we don't have anyone from ehm.",
            "Yes. some day to go",
            "Yes tody I wrote them email to run ten two segmenters, but they didn't replied.",
            "Yeah, so for now I suggest that ehm we all keep ehm connected to this call and ehm we'll do the debugging) an at various places and if you are not debugging at  anything at any point, then  ehm well just keep working on whatever you have to do ehm otherwise, but please keep listening in, ehm so that when you have problem ehm we can ask immediately.",
            "ehm and  ehm I'll have to leave for another call in thirty minutes from now, but PERSON3 and PERSON20 will be ehm here ehm and another thing that we ehm still have not started debugging is the  ehm is the video  broadcastings, so we should make yourself this opportunity and see ehm yeah  if I can  ehm if I can shift the video from Linux mischief for example.",
            "Say it again? German is being is going to be published?",
            "Yes, I  I  I  I turned English off and I started German, cause I struggled with  plunging English and German at once.",
            "So I am going to r rum them separately.",
            "S so can we see this somewhere?",
            "Yes, ehm it's PROJECT2..com",
            "ehm, it's not translation) service then.",
            "It is not?",
            "ehm Was a was a question.",
            "This should be using your translation service, right?",
            "I  I am not sure.",
            "I don't think it's logging anything but, is looking for the long files.",
            "Yes, because we have English to German translator from so, I  I think  ehm o okay, that's  you mustn't one.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "But let's  let's try Romanian, because there is only  your Romanian.",
            "We have Romanian?",
            "Oh let's see. ehm",
            "Yes, we have.",
            "Now I started it.",
            "So English I  I  no  no",
            "PERSON5 say something.",
            "Okay, one, two, three, four. ehm",
            "Okay, I can  What I noticed in the English channel is that ehm I still see a lot of ehm old English subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable",
            "And I think this is  these words ehm were uttered by me several minutes ago.",
            "So I think it's caching terribly.",
            "PERSON9, can you  can you confirm, can you somehow  is there a way to flush ehm the cash? ehm",
            "A way to flush ehm where'd the cash be?",
            "ehm within the ehm presentation platform.",
            "ehm in the protocol there's) the  ehm let say flush message, who actually performs the ehm flush of the.",
            "But actu but and I think that is that ehm there still be in incremental transcription problem to be solved out.",
            "And because it  ehm the same phrase is proposed several times, with ehm sl small differences.",
            "A are you working on  on this problem or  or actually with this integration the  keep the ASR or",
            "Beside)  ehm yeah, we don't) just aware we're talking about this the other day and we've forgotten, m partially the same thing actually ASR.",
            "I think explosive the paper and which explains it.",
            "ehm zigzag",
            "PERSON13 had some kind of ehm simple caching.",
            "Yeah",
            "The paper sieze, ehm if I correctly undestand the ehm they maintain the ehm start time the same ehm until ehm the is ehm finalised, and then they a new start time, when ehm it goes on in the press diction.",
            "Yeah, so, PERSON13)  PERSON13  PERSON13 just said these loging to check this ehm",
            "Am I  I think the idea is he logs it to  to determine that it really is the algorithm specified to the paper.",
            "Yes, so he hasn't made any changes, we only noticed the paper yesterday.",
            "Yes so maybe Yes and yes. ehm let's let's copy this link to  the ORGANIZATION4 document, because ehm in it appears in many  ehm in various channels and it's if you  if you it.",
            "ehm",
            "But if you are looking at the subtitles at PROJECT2..com, ehm then ehm the English should be live what ehm from what I  ehm what I'm saying.",
            "So, ehm there should be ehm little or no ehm delay between my words and what and what appears in the English  ehm and  ehm as for now  I  d  like at this point I see the English stuck and no ehm words of mine.",
            "Yes,  () so fault now.",
            "Okay.",
            "It  it's. () Only the Romanian is running, but I can't see any output from it.",
            "Yeah, I  I don't see any output ehm inthe Romanian subtitles either.",
            "So can we somehow debug ehm what is happening?",
            "Where is my speech ehm where it stuck word doesn't get through and why there is nothing in the  ehm in the Romanian.",
            "So how do we diagnose.",
            "ehm I  I asked the ASR workers, they are running or not or if they are available but  not responding.",
            "If I may?",
            "Yes.",
            "ehm the  the very last published message I can se on  form the publisher is ehm three minutes old now, so no one is publishing right now.",
            "Yeah that's  PERSON3 says that that's correct, so, PERSON3, please, let us now, when ehm the publishing will start again and we will re  re things.",
            "Okay.",
            "PERSON3, should I do the same something?",
            "Should I do the same something? ehm",
            "who available o the ASR) workers, ane For some reason anyone here won't be  ehm in the call.",
            "No one can hear you. Takže máme tam dva",
            "Hey guys, sorry, may I make a stupid question? ehm",
            "Yeah.",
            "Did we invite?",
            "Because I think that it's really important to have at least PERSON22 and PERSON13 participating ehm this call.",
            "PERSON3 emailed them ehm yesterday ehm and they did not respond to that email at all five minutes ago and didn's respond either.",
            "Okay, so sorry.",
            "So what's the current problem, I'm not sure the ASR's working.",
            "ehm PERSON3, is the ASR working at the moment? Is the ASR working at the moment?",
            "we're there",
            "ehm, people cannot hear you, PERSON3, for some reason And now you can hear me, right? yeah.",
            "Now we  I can  or I can't share the screen, I  we have there two two ASR workers from English, which are available.",
            "And I just minute ago and they should output something, but they don't.",
            "Well I'm not saying anything.",
            "ehm t they should be producing something only when I'm talking.",
            "But you're talking it didn't occur  Yeah I'm talkin now.",
            "And ehm there's going nothing hitting the MT server",

            "Yes,",
            "How many ASR workers are available and  Two are registered as available, but one of them is not working, so I try this scond one.",
            "ehm",

            "Okay.",
            "So now, here we can see  that we have two  two ASR wors workers, but here  yeah  let's see how many segmenters.",
            "O okay so we run out of segmenters.",
            "Okay.",
            "sector two texts.",

            "So, ehm I'll try ehmto mute myself ehm to keep hearing myself when I'll be talking ehm to the other call, but that  what we rarely happening is ELG.",
            "So PERSON11, ehm the first agenda is metaphorum and ehm I said that ehm there in the list it appears PROJECT2 most likely  ehm ORGANIZATION1 and your name was a question mark.",
            "Okay, yeah that  that's  that should be okay. ehm",
            "Yeah, exactly, so at this point Yeah. I think it's okay.",

            "Yeah, okay. And, ehm",
            "probably he's going to metaphorum too, but  I can ask him Yeah. to look after it later.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so",
            "Sorry guys, what we are going to test right now?",
            "Yeah, is  is the testing still going on?",
            "Because, we) should probably actually drop off reasonably soon.",
            "Well, On PERSON5 does, ehm but PERSON3, are you still there?",
            "ehm I can see some  traffic  hitting a ehm translation servers.",
            "PERSON9, do you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Well, ehm this is probably not the perfectc time ehm, but ehm I'd like to raise the point of incriprion, that it would be nice to have  ehm on the  on the presentation interface ehm to have the HTTPS mandatory at least.",
            "But it's not mandatory, but at the moment the HTTPS should work.",
            "Yes, that's correct, because for the at least for the event it would be nice to have it mandatory, probably with some  at least a simple password.",
            "Because if it's",
            "At the moment, ehm we haven't had any requirements for ehm user authentication, but ehm we willing to use it ehm in the next versions, not for this event, sorry.",
            "Oh, then I'm not sure if you'll be able to use it, that  that's bad.",
            "Hi, this is PERSON20, PERSON3 is having some trouble with the connecting the Internet we  we will join soon  like",
            "Okay, ehm, actually there is ehm problem in managing ehm user's data.",
            "Ehm, for the GDPR ehm, and  the) requires ehm much more ehm deep reasoning about  on how to store user data.",
            "PERSON4, what's your  ehm your point?",
            "Did you understand the problem?",
            "doubt, can you repeat?",
            "Actually, ehm there's a problem in for storying a used data.",
            "And we require ehm much more ehm deep reasoning about it and this is the reason why in this version of this presentation platform we didn't store any data.",
            "Neither ehm username and password that they",
            "Oh, we donť need a participant username and password, one password for the whole call will be sufficient.",
            "And no usernames are needed, just something to prevent anyone from anywhere to listen in.",
            "ehm okay, I understand, I can ask you to, but, actually, it was not planned.",
            "Can you hear me now?",
            "Yes, sure.",
            "Hello, I apologise for  yeah.",
            "For not saying it earlier, I hope you will be make  able to make just the most basic things.",
            "Okay, ehm I cannnot promise) it but ehm we will work  we will start work on it ehm as soon as possible.",
            "So now we should see French subtitles from English source from one recording from last year  workshop.",
            "But I can's see any output.",
            "So what's happening?",
            "I first tried the segmenter, English segmenter",
            "nothing",
            "There may be an error in the segmenter.",
            "From English to English.",
            "I work out and have a look at",
            "Yes, I can't get any output from segmenter but I get it from ASR.",
            "PERSON4?",
            "I aske d the ehm the ehm o that say ehm super general authentication on the platform developer.",
            "And they ehm pulled) me that actually it's  ehm it's easy to do things we already reason about it and it's available for the, okay?",
            "Okay, thank you very much for the good news.",
            "yes I am so happy to know it.",
            "Yeah, seems that  that one segmenter is running but the second one is not running.",
            "I doesn't output anything.",
            "What do you mean by second segmenter?",
            "I  I launched two instances of ebclient, two identical ones, one was from NEUlecture hybrid, into NEU text, and it doesn't output anything, and the second one was the same and it",
            "Yeah.",
            "now I can connect or do you just get an no output.",
            "I got  I'm getting no output from the first one.",
            "And it's connected.",
            "Yeah, and, the second instance can't connect at all at this moment, but  yeah  oh  wait  wait now it's connected and it's outputting the text,",
            "which seems that there's the  the same ASR but sometimes it doesn't output anything.",
            "But is avai but seems available.",
            "So I am  I right now have ten instances of this running all off putting hard files I  I don't even know which one you're connected to.",
            "Because it's  I could see you with this producing output because then it's writing something to the logs.",
            "But it's not producing output, then I can look at logs  is  Yes. not producing output.",
            "Ehm Yes. if you can connect and you  it say you get up pipeline then then there should be definitely output if there is input.",
            "So, the problem might be  that  maybe the audio is not sent correctly.",
            "It sure be sent  right.",
            "Because when I try un text instead of text, send it to  ASR  now",
            "Sorry, ehm I think I'm gonna drop off this call, ehm I can see that there  will we get text through hits the empty workers, our empty workers, but obciously we haven't to stress them yet.",
            "ehm  Yes. I  I'm not sure, if you  yeah I'm again we off contact for an hour or two.",
            "ehm But try some slack anyway.",
            "ehm is actually  Okay. is actually flyingtoday so don't think you'll be in touch.",
            "ehm But  Okay, thanks. he a sorry about that, now I  I should  I should leave now.",
            "Okay, good luck for the debugging.",
            "Yeah, thank you.",
            "Bye bye, bye bye.",

            "What is not",
            "ehm for us, for prevoice) to be there in the previous afternoon.",
            "Okay.",

            "Okay.",
            "Yes, so we  we do what  what we can.",
            "Sorry guys, are we still testing something?",
            "Do you hear me?",
            "Yes I can hea yes I can her you.",
            "I  I'm  I'm going to  my  microtest script wit with a test case and  and upload it to the crise control repo.",
            "Then you can see and  and  and try it if it's  if it's okay.",
            "Okay, ehm have you talked  ehm we about ehm the ehm the bridge fingerprints, we",

            "Okay, But we  start the bridges. is it",

            "Because speaking the English speaking German an so on.",
            "It possible for us to check each  each path  togther?",
            "ehm we need to change this on the client side.",
            "Just to restart cients, change the fingerprints",
            "Okay, we can do it in the afternoon",
            "What do you mean?",
            "I just want to be sure that ehm we are able to provide the correct ehm source language in the presentation platform.",
            "Yes, o o okay.",
            "So you want to have there the meta metainformation that this comes from",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "So we  I didn't notice.",
            "So how can we do do it?",
            "ehm if we  if you are available we can do it ehm now, but if you prefer to descripting the  control record we can do it also later  Yes. not a problem.",
            "Yes, I'm going to finish the script",
            "Okay, perfect.",
            "ehm do you still need us in this call?",
            "We can come back in the afternoon.",
            "Yes, you can come back in the afternoon.",
            "Okay, thank you. Or we can write on",

            "How are you.",
            "Yes. So, are we missing anyone? We have all partners present show I If people so Thanks for coming. This call should be quick, hopefully. There is nothing that I would know about that we need to discuss uh, like in in in a very big detail,ehm. So let's get started. And if other people join then, well, ehm they can tell us further for the details. So ehm what is my first question is to PERSON6. Ehm after we have have had the call on Monday, what is the proposed development schedule. And when there could be some preliminary some prototype implementation that we could test. So if we have PERSON6 on the call. I saw her. But her camera is disabled and I don't know if she can speak. So we see PERSON7 joining as well. So PERSON6 are you on the call? Or maybe she still yeah never mind.",
            "So ehm let's wait for PERSON6. And we also,do we have PERSON10 Here are not yet. .",
            "Yeah, I'm here,I'm here with",
            "Yep. Okay. Great. So PERSON10 ehm what is the status of the PROJECT3 worker? Because last week, you've said that he you will ehm dust off your  And how promising or problematic does it look now?",
            "Okay, so. According make some steps so far. So the plan is will be ORGANIZATION1 welcome, will be PERSON1, and inbetween will be Python Sorrow that's excepts sentences for translation from the ORGANIZATION1 worker. And so ORGANIZATION1 worker workable will probably just be forwarding requests. So this Python based which would I do preproccessing and he can handly many, yeah, not so well the logic, where need to be dealing with partial sentences, but",
            "Yeah.",
            "with partial sentences and then will forward the requester onto the PROJECT3 server yourself. So a very basic Python based, so to do the preprocessing and received request so yet  for translations forward and post him back. But I haven't started on the actual ORGANIZATION1 worker yourself.",
            "But that should be Feli ehm easy to do that. Because I think they probably even have something like that in the SLT ORGANIZATION3 repository. Did you call some translation system simply by pipe as well? So, I think the the there should be almost ready ORGANIZATION1 worker available.",
            "Okay, yes and also the empty worker ehm.",
            "Ehm.",
            "Probably I need to be some little bit adaptation for what I'm doing anyway.",
            "Yeah. So that looks good. So I think that next week for example, you should know whether this proof of concept worked, or what do you have running to any issues.",
            "Yeah,and we can start thinking about the tricky.",
            "Yeah, so for partial sentences, I think that they should be treated from the PROJECT3 prospective as simple simply a different sentences, other sentences that we expected to process. So. So the ORGANIZATION1 worker should send every segment to to PROJECT3 for translation. And and that's it.",
            "Okay.",
            "So PERSON8 does not see any difference. Uh, assuming that the PROJECT3 model would be trained to work reasonably well.",
            "Hi, guys. Sorry. I had some problem with the internet connection.",
            "Yeah. No problem. Nice. Glad that you're here. Partial sentences. Okay. One thing that I would still like to know PERSON10, is the handling of timestamps. Ehm, handling of timestamps. So this is something that needs to be carefully checked, because timestamps will be later on important for the presentation platform. And we need to we need to know where to start overwriting. and PERSON8's guess uh is that the worker should work well with timestamps and totaly hide them from the Python and PROJECT3. So I think that to like the timestamps should not go to the Python server at all,",
            "Okay.",
            "But that's my guess. and the the limitation with this approach is that we can handle only like one single timestamp at the beginning and would be the end of the segment. But we don't have any finer information. So the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or. Is that problem. So this is something for PERSON6 to know about. And think how if if these two timestamps and string comparison are sufficient for the presentation. ORGANIZATION1",
            "Sorry, PERSON8, I didn't get the point.",
            "Yeah. So they uhm we have discussed this on in the Monday call. How do we present partial translations and partial output. And how do we make sure that the updates are reasonably well displayed. So for updates you don't want to repeat everything. And I think that we had something like the textfiled. Yeah.",
            "Sorry, at the presentation platforms must arrived only what we want to publish. So, the .",
            "Yes.",
            "Let's say uhm PROJECT3 out of the incremental updates must be done.",
            "Uhm, new one. I thought that our agreement on Monday was different. And that the basic unit that you send to the presentation platform is called a textfield content. So, but then the textfield content can be sent several times as an update. And then at some point somehow there will be made a decision that let's move on to the next textfield. And at that point the presentation platform would like scroll it up, and it would again start displaying whatever comes as as full textfield. It will be a replacing the content of the of the textfield with with the new messages. So this would be the partial sentences gradually expending gradually longer and longer sentences. And then again at some point uhm the this would be like most scrolled up. And and another set of updates would be coming",
            "No no no, the presentation platforms is just presentation here. So hm it wil update the text incoming messages. But the incoming messages must be exactly what we want to be displayed on the uhm on the uhm subtitle. Will not be implemented any logic to manage the partial hypoteses and partial translation output.",
            "But the the scrolling the history of previous texts fields would that be supported?",
            "Hm, yes.",
            "Yes. So when do you decide whether the textfield should be replaced or scrolled up?",
            "Based on messages. A new message is a new subtitle to be displayed and it can subtitute the biggest one or update the let's say the button of the textfield in order to let.",
            "Yes, so in other words yes part of the message that the presentation of platform is receiving is an indicator, whether this is an update. so replace the current field, or this is a new text field move the history up and populate the field with with this new content, right?",
            "Hm, I believe they we treaty exactly at the same way. Each message is intendent we new subtitle.",
            "Aaa, that's bad. That'",
            "That's just whether of presentation if we want to completly replace and use the history, or that we history scroll up.",
            "Yeah, I still hm we we I think we need to discuss this again a fresh call. So, so PERSON8 ehm needs to discuss with PERSON6 the updates versus history of text uhm text fields. Yeah. So well once we discussed this. I think that we'll arrive at the solution where the timestamp of the beginning would be the critical information. And as long as the timestamp is the same, the field should be replaced with with the new content. And if the timestamp is higher than the current the last text field should be like move to the history and and closed. And we would be displaying the the contents from this timestamp on. I think the the starting timestamp would be the critical uhm point.",
            "I suggest to discuss again about it.",
            "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, for PERSON10 I don't think there is anything changes. But we will let you know if if we see something like that. So PERSON6 when you were fighting with your network connection, I had one question on you. And that was the development schedule for the presentation platform after we have discuss it on Monday. So, would there be any prototype available uhm at a work point would would there be any prototype avalaible?",
            "There's no prototype available at the moment, I'm sorry.",
            "Yes, that's expected. I would not expect any prototype today.",
            "Okay. But when when would do you have one?",
            "Last time I discuss about it the first prototype presentable should be at the 15th of June. I know it's realy uhm close to our deadline, but this is the only information I have that. Of course we can on work on our let's say raw prototype.",
            "Yes, yes, so",
            "Probably the development team have something close to be fine advertial to use as prototype, but we can have some working maybe for. I don't have any other information.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So yes, I would really like to see let's finish prototype sooner. So that to me like find whatever problems are are there as soon as possible.",
            "Yes, I understand.",
            "Yeah, okay. Great, so another question that I have and that's maybe for ORGANIZATION3 if So who who we have from ORGANIZATION3, only PERSON11. So maybe PERSON11 would not would not like have have the power to decide this. Do we plan to run any ORGANIZATION2 workers in LOCATION1, so especially the ASR the ASRs of English and other things as a fall back solution. And also this could be relevant to the ORGANIZATION2 calls with live subtitling. We have not We have decided not to use the ORGANIZATION2 platform today, because we are still checking some of the recording qualities. And we have people here with Linux machines only. But essentially ORGANIZATION2 is very far in the implementation. So they are able to connect to the ORGANIZATION1 platform and then the whole chat window is flooded with the messages not enough workers available. So I thought that it would be interesting, uh maybe good idea to start as many workers as possible at uh in ORGANIZATION3.",
            "And if there is some hardware limits, we can also run some from here. So that's that's why I'm asking this clones of alpha workers to run in LOCATION1. PERSON11, would you ehm would you have any idea, if if this is easy to do of interest and useful. And and so on? Ty I only more worker and now is sexteen or fifteen worker ASR, who are close connected. It's one thing. And second thing are not sure about that wayteh It will we have the platform. I will have the and whether we can start I think it maybe ok. And it be can view some no voice and somewhere I think it is okay we also other things. So our thing is okay. .",
            "Yeah, okay. So so is good that there that many workers now, so I I actually suggest that we try after this c . This part of the call to switch to the ORGANIZATION2 platform, at least with some of us those who are interested, and we could see how that works with the workers available. So I would like to make use of that you spend some time to run them. So I would be curious myself to see how that works if the workers are available. Okay, so the summary is that ORGANIZATION3 will prepare an image, and ORGANIZATION4 will try to get that running. Yeah. ok, but But since you are able to provide sixteen workers, and it is not too big burden for you, right? Sixteen workers it's okay. You can do it like whenever we like and and then for them. Yeah?",
            "Now I think we need to sets worker with also I have the things I'm and ehm the things running on the same so, yeah, some we stand when we need more worker I think we have to stop limit number workers.",
            "Yeah. So what is what is so sixteen is already not comfortable for you?",
            "I have been check it carefully I yeah because we have the limit number and maybe that it the same time working at the same time maybe like we have the. I mean it is one list internet with, and the also from memory or limit number to memory also.",
            "Okay, so yes. So in in the longterm, it would be useful to have this image spread out for the various reasons that you mentioned, for the uh workshop itself we should be good. Okay. Yeah. So it's the priority of this image is not uh not high. And so the there is no real rush with this image. I would say. So I think that we we should be fine relying on, but that's please talk to PERSON3, what he thinks, because in some early stage we discuss that for just for a backup purposes. It would be better to have this. Uuh, to have two sides providing the workers. Um. So ask PERSON3 agrees that backup sides of ASR workers is very  well sensible thing to do. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you very much. And after the call I'll reboot to windows. And I'll see if I can connect that room.",
            "If if I see the workers. So whoever is curious on the presentation, please use the ORGANIZATION2 link, well PERSON5 if you could find this ORGANIZATION2 link and aaa and posted here. Yeah. To be tested with ORGANIZATION2 after this call, and here'll be the oral. Yep. platform is ready. So PERSON2 are you here? We have, I seen you but I cannot hear yet. So once PERSON2, can can speak? Hopefully we will learn where when we will be getting the files for domain adaptation and so on. Yes, PERSON2, was that you? That was someone. Yeah, ASR worker the bug. So this is this is probably something that PERSON4 added. .",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah. So whatehm have we seen another situation? I know that in the call yesterday, with ORGANIZATION2 the workers worked at the beginning. But at the end of the call it seemed that there are totally know available worker. So it seemed like that during the uh, the session yesterday. The workers have one by one died out.",
            "Yeah. I didn't attend the yesterday meeting, but the bug that I mentioning is that sometimes the work, one worker can handle several sessions, but then it's, but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.",
            "So, and when you see say several session you mean consecutive ones like one after another.",
            "Yes. It seems that it's it's available. But in fact he doesn't output anything. So. Ty Yeah. I will us, but yesterday so yeah I don't know what is happening there, because we when I do know whatprophones it was able to handling several sessions. And that I think it in one sentence it ehm it yeah output and I can't fancy call but it it was in call, So I have no idea, I think I this is a I think I had to information and then maybe I can hopefully I can see the one simply wrong come from",
            "Yeah. So I think it's it's very important PERSON11 that you create a script that will like replicate it this bug. So that you will maybe set up, maybe maybe there could be a set up support ORGANIZATION1 mediator, and you would connect only one worker to this mediator and and",
            "Our only support input fingerprint. Or in",
            "Yes, yes, yes. So use as input fingerprint and keep like loading importer or keep requesting ASR from one copy. One instance of your worker. In a script. Do it with offline it we have the same problem with offline ASR. So not only online ASR. So do it with offline ASR. As and as soon as as the worker stops responding. And I don't know. So, so this script is should be like a stress test, and you can put it to the cruise control repository. And then mo most importantly you need to run it and figure out where the problem is and then the bucket, but Yeah.",
            "Okay. of course. If there is anything we can do in order to help you the publing the problem, we stand us careful the mediator to test just your worker for some Or anything else we are avalaible.",

            "Yes, PERSON12, now we can hear you.",
            "Ok, yeah, so the microphone here was muted. Sorry. So now, the voice level of the amplification should be reasonable. Okay. Great. So that is one monitoring problem fixed. And, can you see me?",
            "Yes, we can see you, so here's PERSON4, PERSON10 and me.",
            "Yeah, so we are here, and this is PERSON11 and PERSON9. And we have the screen in the back and the screen is still empty. It's only some mountains above that should be ideally, the presentation from PERSON9's notebook. Uh, through, um, the like which is there to PERSON11's notebook and PERSON11's notebook is also recording all theall the audio through this. So we have two inputs, uh, and one of them microphone has that batteries but. So but we don't have any true German speaker at the moment. So the the worst problem is that PERSON4 will not be available for this call. I don't know how this is possible. Uh, he has another meeting, and I also haven't heard from. Haven't heard from PERSON3 this morning, and what we don't have is the presentation platform. So the way we are presenting the subtitles, for now, is only directly when the worker.",
            "The sorry, when when the client at PERSON11's notebook. What's the status at your notebook?  That's all right, I'm the only one who is talking on Pexip now. So, So what we have there, ehm, can you share the screen? Screensharing, share my screen, So you should be seeing. This is this is what you should be seeing now, it's PERSON11's screen that runs the client for connecting together, one ASR worker and then the translation into Czech. That's the lower, the larger window in the background. And the machine translation worker is which one? Is it the PERSON11. So PERSON4, you have all the languages running, right?.",
            "I did, some of them have just going down i tried to modify, Czech is running.",
            "Yeah, should we try different language, so that you can also see the quality?",
            "Ehm, I think maybe down,",
            "Yeah, please test test German worker and PERSON11 can at the same time start third window, right? Uh, with um, another client getting the same sound input and sending it now through the through the German empty. So what we have now, on PERSON11's screen, which you can also see, it's shared there. It's two of the commands. One of the command is running only the ASR worker and the other command the lower window is running both, the ASR worker and the machine translation into Czech. And I would like a third one, which would be also doing the machine translation into German. And this is the set up where all the workers are totally like independent. And the same ASR processing is done two times now, and it will be done three times with the German one.",
            "We have only one English segmenter. So we can run onlyWe have two segmenters. So we can run only two at once.",
            "Yeah, that's that's a problem, and we don't have PERSON4 to add more. So we'll have to give up on one of these outputs right. Yep, so what should we tests now?",
            "German translation.",
            "Yeah, German ASR.",
            "Yeah, German ASR, that's another thing that we could try.",
            "Do we have do we have a empty system German to English?",
            "I'm not sure, that PERSON4 would could have one. And ORGANIZATION3 could have one, German to English.",
            "Sorry, we don't have machine system, but we could try test the ASR if you want.",
            "Yeah, so I think that's we should try that as well. So for the for the workshop actually, it's it's seems that we are short of German interpreters. So the German signal will be available only like for 20 minutes, and then 20 minute break and 20 minutes again, because it will be only one person attending the the last 20 minutes, and they they have to take break. So that is at least one benefit of our technology that it should, if it runs it runs. But anyway, we should be ready for for that, because the German from the ASR will be much better and German speakers will be much happier to see uh, the the human interpretation, but we should be testing everything. So I think we should do it with the other mike, right? So I will try to get the batteries, ehm, and you're right that the good thing about German ASR is that we don't rely on the German, on the English segmentation worker so that that could run as well.",
            "So I'll, I'll get the mike with um, the weather is for the second mike. So, well without the headphones, you won't, ehm, no one will hear you in the room. .",
            "So now saying that our English also running empty would like to test that.",
            "Ok, so I'm going to run it. Ok, so I'll share my screen again. So I launched the German empty, English to German. Now I'm speaking German, now I'm speaking English and I should see German translation. Can you see it?",
            "Yes, that, it says you're now talking about ehm you're talking about bacteria",
            "Can you say something? Let's try this.",
            "I'm sorry for my lateness.",
            "Ok.Yeah, ok.So we have German empty, yes, we have English into German empty, PERSON12 is back.",
            "Yeah, sorry, we've just noticed this it the ORGANIZATION3 translation service, not the any problem. I think we might want to try ORGANIZATION4 as well.",
            "Ok. Wait, so I add another option, here, ORGANIZATION4, you, the ORGANIZATION4. So this is your empty, right? So, what time I'm talking about right now, tell me, computer. Tell me, tell me, what time I'm talking about.",
            "Not too bad.",
            "Yeah, this is not too bad. We can try something, something.",
            "Yes, it has to be some, some prodution from your polits, yes, Mr. President.",
            "Yeah, PERSON12 is starting another mike, right now. This is all right, it's set up. You should see blinking here, PERSON12.",
            "So I'm I'm yes,",
            "One, two, three, four,...One, two, three, four, so this is what I'm saying directly to the head set microphone. You can see me and PERSON11 is also holding the second mike, so that you hear what I'm saying, and you are seeing the translations with the delay one, two three, so yes,",
            "Cool.",
            "But I'm following the German words that I spot. Occasionally they are related, but I cannot acess the the sentence quality. That's too hard for me to to process.",
            "It looks looks ok,",
            "The segmentation is getting the end of one sentence in the beginning of the next, and we not read it preparefull that, and I think that's something that we need to talk to ORGANIZATION3 they can fix that and make sure that they're not getting these overlapped to two sentences but that's a tranlastions starts. All that input starts with the new sentence.",
            "That's a lot of repetitions.",
            "That's a lot of repetitions, that you hear that. Do we get the same segment same phrase six times and translate it five six times.",
            "Yes, recieving into the fix, into resending.",
            "Can you PERSON3, guys hear us?",
            "Yes.",
            "So there is a lot of repetitions and",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "are coming in.",
            "We are solving another issue, with with presentation right now. We cannot follow your discussion. But it would be nice if you wrote the conclusion from this discussion, from this observation to the doc.",
            "Ok, we will.",
            "Whoever whoever what's a problem, please put it into the Google doc at the end of today's blog, there's the critical observations from the test. So any observation you make, please, add it there. So that we know what what to fix. And we also noticed that I don't know how to share it,how to do it. So can you open the Pexip, I'll take the second headset. Yeah. So look at look at my screen, look at the web cam that I'm presenting now. So you're now looking at PERSON9's notebook and the think is this HD HD button view full motion presentation. And you have to click this view full motion presentation so that the frame rave of Pexip is is higher and that you will see what exactly is rolling on the ehm on the clients of the ASR. So do you see the click it PERSON9.",
            "The HD, it will become blue, no, post thing, view normal presentation. So do you see that? That icon, it's second from the uh, right on the list of icons of Pexip. .",
            "So I'll try to share it in another way as well as well, but I'm not sure if I'll I'll make it. So I will share my screen, entire screen. Allow. So I'm now sharing myBut then, yeah. So I'm sharing my whole screen but the full motion icon has has hidden away has hidden away. So I don't know how to, maybe it's not possible to do with the with the screen sharing. So it'sThat's right, yeah, ok. So I'll stop my screen sharing again. No, no, we hit the screenshot. So, the, the list of icons that I was So the the issue that we are trying to to help you solve now is that when you are following the the screen presented by PERSON11, PERSON11 are you still presenting the screen? Yep. So when you are when you are following that screen, you will see only update of whole page, like every one or two seconds and that's different, that's very different from what we are seeing. We are seeing it live, many like lines added one by one. I can show you on my from my webcam. So if you look at the webcam. The webcam is maybe a faster. Do you see, do you see what is actually happening on PERSON11's laptop? It's much faster. When I'm talking.It's adding repeated sentences. And it's like continuously updating the the translations into both German and Czech. But in Pexip screensharing, you see an update only every two seconds. And to the HD button is the thing that will let you see it in live like faster, without this delay. Was that clear?",
            "That was clear suited for connection so, the HD one.",
            "appear",
            "That's how it's work. We had to click it before now it's broken apparently.",
            "So someone is now highlighting the thing, it's who is sharing that's screen.",
            "we found it there.",
            "Yeah, so maybe taky a screenshot of this for for our next call. So that later, we know what what is where. And we, we have PERSON3 on the call as well, right PERSON3, can you hear us?",
            "Yes, I'm here, good morning.",
            "Yeah, yeah, morning So I'll try it. It's only me, maybe PERSON9 can hear it. Right? PERSON9, PERSON11 can not hear what we are saying. So that's bigI don't hear PERSON9.  Yeah, so we'll add one more lapSo PERSON9 was using muted? But you are stillI cannot hear, PERSON9.",
            "I need to enable both.",
            "Yep. Okay. So you can now hear PERSON9, as well. And we should avoid loud speakers. So it will be better. If do we still have another headset? For PERSON11? Yeah. So PERSON11 will connect with one more laptop. So that PERSON11 can can hear us as well. So in the meantime, eh PERSON3 in the Google document,there isSo maybe I will. I will start sharing my screen. That is probably the best idea. Share entire screen. Allow. So if you are following a If you are seeing my screen this it the preparatory calls Google document. And here, at the end of the session today. There is this critical observations from the test. And I would like to ask everyone, whoever has some observation please add it here. So that weSo that we know about the issue. So the first issue is that",
            "Ok.",
            "Yep. So the first issue that we spotted was that we need life monitoring of everything. If anything is bad we need to trace one step back and see if it was good and this step back or or not. Uh, another. Uh, thing is that multiplexing is probably necessary. So the idea is that right now on the cable, a connection PERSON11's notebook is sending three English, three audios? PERSON11, are you sending three audios?  Only two. No, he's sending two two audios. But we need to send one audio for each output language. Actually.",
            "Haven't you tested the multipol input stream request?",
            "Wait, mike, can you hear me?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes",
            "Yeah, what did you ask?",
            "Have you tested the multiple imput request functionality. I know you extended the the client. But probably you have the multiple input request functionality sent you an email, I don't remember",
            "Yes.",
            "if this week or the last one.",
            "Okay. Yes, I didn't try it this week. But before the trade fair, we used this functionality. We had one empty One ASR and one recorder and this worked. So I believe that it's still working.",
            "It could It could work also asking, for example, for multiple eh translations that's giving the input audio file, and they want, for example the germGerman audio file and that want in to receive the English translation and the French translation. The chain work.",
            "Ok. So I will try it. will be really nice to have it.",
            "OK. The so that's the multiplexing. Then, this is this is observation by ORGANIZATION4. So maybe they could summarize what what they have recorded, of what have they noticed to PERSON3. And me as well, because I haven't heard it.",
            "One thing is efficiency thing, like we are getting the same request multiple times, sometimes four five times the same input. Right now it's fine, but it's a bit waste the speciality, to have couple minute languages.",
            "So there should be minimum cashing like, never send",
            "And if it doesn't change just don't resend it.",
            "Okay, I have, probably some update, because I talked about this this behavior, yesterday, with PERSON5 and PERSON4. And actually in the year all used case the one who use the air lange mediator. And not the ORGANIZATION6 one they manage these these behavioral directly in the displace server. And all their workers are are meant to work in a transparent behavior. They translate multiple times. The same ASR output. And then they feature out segments in their own application. This, of course, is it's not optimal and managing such logic in the presentation layer and it's my opinion at least. It's not correct and it bounce also the usages to the key worker. So I'm trying to figure out something to manage it for the June eh fairThe June meeting. And they told me that probably the eh machine translation of ORGANIZATION1 has some kind of improvement, and it was the one I was trying to check this morning.",
            "PERSON11 do you confirm that you manage something in your workers?.",
            "I started some workers. But but yesterday, I tried only the debugging workers. Only the the dummy back end SMT.",
            "And I'm trying to investigate this behavior. And what comes out was that the off set is the off set value is probably the one who will contain the key of this solution. Because, as far as I understood. But I have still to check it. They updated the offset only when I finally pote disease arrives. And Or something something like this. PERSON4 shared with me a Python script last night, who manage the eh ASR output, filtering out only final hypothesis. And actually. It works on beginning and not on offset and so also get confused, but we are reason about this topic and we'll update you, of course, or if you discover something, please update me. And at the end we will probably find the solution. We are reasoning about it. I perfectly understand that it's it's not eh ehIt is not comfortable to translate multiple times the same ASR out.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so I'm. I'm not sure if I totally understood. If you were referring only to this problem of of the repetitive input to machine translation, if not if you were talking also about another issue. Please make a separate bullet points here.",
            "No, no, it should be the same issue, but I also, I'm a little bit confused the on this topic, than probably I haven't explain it very well.",
            "So uh, I think it was ORGANIZATION4 people who said that the empty worker cannot distinguish between January repetition. And wierd ASR behavior, I agree. So this is this is like a presentation issue. We do want to display the same thing twice, if it was set twice. But I think that even if there is a genuine repetition. Your empty worker could save the uh, the graphics card, or whatever the CP use, time and could cash it. So I think the cashing is useful even if eh even if there is genuine repetition.",
            "Ok, so you still wants us to return something even if it can say we could repeat it. That's what you are saying.",
            "Yeah, I think the the empty worker should be totally like ignoring any context. It should be like a.It should not be trying to be clever. If it's recieve something twice.",
            "Yes.",
            "It should send it twice.",
            "We can do that it's justIt still seem eh, like the pushing the problem downstream.",
            "I think it's what we want, because like it's very same string then the empty worker should not have been called. So this is this is the bug. But if it is a minor extension of the sentence then we do want the empty worker to see the whole sentence again,so",
            "So it is the same or is it the same",
            "Yeah, so, the same string repeated, how could that happen? We do not have anyone from ORGANIZATION3 on the call. But it is possible that they received they recieved some more audio. And the final hypothesis they create from this, is the identical string. That would be my guess.",
            "So. In that case, they should simply avoid sending an update if it is not different from the previous update.",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "Yeah. So the the alti ee match best solution is that the ASR worker double checks it's output and never sends the same string ehmIfWell I should very different list still. They will take this outputs, soEven if a longer sound segmentIf longer sound segment happens to lead to the same text hypothesis, this update should not be send to the subsequent empty worker, because it is not real update. So that's the that's the thing. So the cashing it actually an an output cash orWell, that was the right wording. So it's avoid useless, yeah. So I'll delete this.",
            "Very quick question, you're not recieving any more translation, did you guys turn this of?",
            "Did you turn this of or is it are the workers still running. So I'm I'm wearing the two mikes.",
            "No, the workers are not running, and I can't get audio into into my laptop right now.",
            "And why has this failed?",
            "I don't know I worry it's only",
            "Sorry, guys I run a test with the English ASR, maybe it's me, I wrack now finish. Sorry.",
            "I was not following you, so.",
            "I I run a test with the English ASR, maybe it was me.",
            "So you think that you were stealing one of the workers, right?",
            "Yeah, I finished, it's all available now.",
            "Yeah, okay, uh. So I'm now talking to the microphone. And and PERSON11's notebook not recording anything yet, but the beringer we have, the sound in the sound card, but we do not have the sound in the system, and it's stopped by itself, or have you been changing any of the sound settings? That's look good. Ok, I'll be saying. One, two, three, four all the time. So sorry for the uh, the useless sound on the Pexip. In the meanWe could we could have some discussion so that I would be stoking only once a while on something useful. So PERSON3, what is the status of of the presentation platform. Is there anything we can test today, remember I should be the one talking more.",
            "Yes.",
            "So what can we do? What can we do to test it? Is there webpage?",
            "Okay, I'mYes, there is. Unfortunately, I prepared the which uses the German ASR. The German segmenter.",
            "Yes.",
            "The English machine translation, and then publish an English subtitle. But unfortunately right now the the German ASR it's not working. So I can ex asure you I really",
            "The German are",
            "less",
            "The German ASR was working while ago, and PERSON11 has one of the workers for himself. So we are following two channels uh, I'm talking to the English channel. And we also have the second mike, and that is intended for that's intended for German speakers here like. So I can keep saying something also in German. So one of the German worker is used by us. Where is the presentation platform web? Can you paste it to the Google documents so that we can look at it? So where PERSON3? Have you heard?",
            "Yes, sorry, ok",
            "Yeah.",
            "I can surely and going to write it in the Google doc",
            "Yeah, so maybe in the status of the components.",
            "Ok, right here?",
            "Yeah yeah, exactly.",
            "Oh my gosh, voice not working. Dunno why does not let me write anything in Google Doc, except to where I do not want to write.",
            "Sorry.Please, okay, um, okay, platform URL. Okay. I can't share these right now, because it's up and running. But maybe it is better if I share my screen with you so",
            "Yes.",
            "you can see my demo. And I'll share with presentation. How can I share the text?",
            "The screen? There is an icon. Can you see it now? So you see me sharing screen. And there is this buttons. A my mouse is moving left to right over them.",
            "No. I do not have this button unfortunately.",
            "You do not have any you don't have this this button for presenting?",
            "No, sorry.",
            "OK. Then you cannot share it. So I will share the platform instead of you. So you can see that in my screen sharing, right.",
            "OK. Thank you all for the support. A Lot Of course, it's a prototype we are working on functionality",
            "Yeah, this is perfect.",
            "and not the looking field.",
            "Perfect, no no, if this works in two weeks from now it would be perfect.",
            "Ok, On the left you have four buttons for configuring the languages. In this moment we have English, French, Italian and German. You can click on them, enabling subtitles.",
            "Yeah.So you can choose more, ok? Yep.",
            "Also more than two, or or mo or less or nonsubtitle.",
            "Perfect.",
            "The big black box is the one who displace the",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "like Bugs Bunny.",
            "There is the  this is a demo of course but when we have the M3U8 URL, we can configure the presentation platform to connect to this streaming and display the provide thing.",
            "Yes, so can we test this now as well?",
            "Yes.",
            "So this is something for PERSON9, so if you can extract PERSON9 to use the VLC in some way. Then possibly there like there could be firewallish user another things. But we should be able to ship the the screen, right? Yeah. This is another thing that should test today.",
            "Ok, okay. If we haveM3U8 URL we can put it in the presentation platform. Actually, the web page is a simple client and it it only display what it recieves. So there is There is no business logic inside it.",
            "Yeah, can we the source code of this web page, like if we want to run this web page ourselves for debugging purposes. Can we get access to that, or maybe if you do not want to share the whole thing, then just the video client, so that we can test the video client.",
            "Well, I haven't worked on the source code so I'm not able to share it with you.",
            "So you don't have it.",
            "No.Is somewhere in the our report, but I can ask for",
            "Yeah. So please use the repository of PROJECT1 to upload at least that part that runs the. At least the webpage that shows the video and this is the thing that we need to link with the screencast that we are going to to send. And then we can test whether it's easier for us to send it through Linux machine or through the VLC in Linux, we'll decide. But this is an important thing.",
            "Okay. () it's important this weekend that's that.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yes, I perfectly understand. And actually we're still working on the integration for example, we have some problems with characters and coding, right now. But the English subtitle which of course the English language doesn't have. Strange characters is also perfectly representing letting one. Works well.",
            "Yeah. This will be important. So we definitely. For the Czech,we definitely need more we need also letting 2 or UTF8. Ideally, we have. Yeah. So we need isolating one and two at the same time. So please move to UTF8.",
            "No, no. Yes, of course. There's something which is not working in the probably in the examale sent. Through the mediator, we are debating this problem exactly this morning.",
            "Yeah. Ok.",
            "When I will find working ASR worker, for example, if you free me the",
            "Is there any way that we could ship the data to it? So",
            "Yes.",
            "PERSON11 has the workers running and if you are following PERSON11's screen as well, I don't know if PERSON11's screen is there.",
            "No.",
            "SoSo if if PERSON11's start sharing, and if you click the HD button which you may have or may not have. I don't have the HD button, PERSON11 has it. This is. How do I ?",
            "Am I sharing right now?",
            "You are not sharing, I don't know how how can I. Maybe I need to stop sharing. So I'll stop presenting for now. I can see PERSON3 now. And maybe PERSON11 can now start to meeting participants in control. So PERSON11 is not sharing. Well anyway",
            "But I'm trying.",
            "Yeah, so what we would like to have is PERSON11 notebook initiating the session. So sending the audio and your presentation platform showing the subtitles corresponding to that. So this is what what we would like to set up a. Uh. Can you can you let us know how to do it?",
            "Yes. At the moment, there are, let me check it on the admin web. There are for example, for sure, the German,Italian, ok, and the English one. I suggest the English the English output since it's it's much more reliable. But, we could use for example. I'm going to write it in the slack channel.",
            "Yeah. Ok.",
            "Mark testing, ok. Ok, this is my there is a worker who manage the publication.",
            "So If the idea is that to simply send to start the client so that the target well signature is this eh, an EU pub, right?",
            "Yes, exactly.Actually, the the worker is completely transparent, the packets he receives send back exactly as he has received them, but as a kind of processing it publish subtitle on the",
            "Ok, So we can also see the output in the EB client eventually.",
            "Yes.",
            "So the locks will not change and, yeah. So PERSON11 is nowThe same work for German right? DEEU pub, does that work as well?",
            "Sorry?",
            "So can we also present tounableI'll show you the, on the",
            "I'm sharing the screen so",
            "You can look at PERSON11's screen in in Pexip.",
            "Yes, The out input fingerprint is wrong, it's DD,.",
            "Yeah, German, DD.",
            "Yes, yes, I can see this one.",
            "Ok.",
            "Ok, so from now on if this connects, I should be able to see so what is it doing. Disconnect. Yeah, I should be able to see in subtitles what I am saying. Well, we see something in the locks but we don't see it in the Elite in the presentation platform yet.",
            "I suggest to try the English one.",
            "Well, both ehm, it's I think PERSON11 have you",
            "Yes, I",
            "connected both.",
            "I connected English and German. As you can see. Here.",
            "Yeah, so on PERSON11's screenshare, only for the English, ok. So PERSON11 now stopped the the German target. And only produces the English output. No, stop the German Yes, so I can see my what I'm saying in on PERSON11's lock, on PERSON11's screen. But I don't see it in the presentation platform.",
            "it's strange, why it's not working. May I try to perform my test?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes.",
            "what's the difference. Where is the",
            "Yes, yeah.",
            "So I'm going to kill it. So you have free resources right now.",
            "The worker is correctly engaged and he says that it's publishing at Winx but I'm me too, I didn't see anything in the presentation platform. And I'm running my test. And it's not working. Why? I think it's a matter of web browser I'm using. Ok. Just the second, sorry.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Mmm, I can. I'm able to see it in my Chrome browser but not my Edge one.",
            "Ok, so I'm using Firefox.",
            "Yeah, maybe, ok, let's try. I'm also on two different computers I don't understand if something also related to It's seems that in the in my Windows laptop it isn't displayed anything even if I run it Even if I run it in Chrome, but on my Linux desktop it work's well.",
            "And is it Google Chrome or Chromium?",
            "Chrome.",
            "Chrome, ok.",
            "Ok, ok, of course for demo we have to manage it, of course. For demo reason I can try to share my",
            "The original work? The screen sharing?",
            "Linux, ok.",
            "I'm start thinking that it's a matter of ehm Windows Firewall. I'm using, you are using a Linux laptop?",
            "Yes, but but I don't have google Chrome, so PERSON9 has. Well, but there is no subtitles. So I can share with through the webcam. So this is PERSON9 PERSON9's Windows laptop with Chrome looking at URL.",
            "I'm not also not able to see anything in my",
            "In Windows.",
            "in my laptop, yep. Oh my gosh. Well, ok, at some point",
            "we have one Linux machine with Does anyone have a Linux machine with Google Chrome? To test it now?",
            "Ok, don't worry, at some point it will work, I'm going to *",
            "Ok.",
            "Talk about it with of course the team.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But, ok, it, actually it work we haven't yet tested the multiple publication. But should be pretty transparent. And we have still some problem with of course browsers and Windows. But also with characters in coding and we are debugging where the problems is originated, there are strange characters coming out from the ASR or if it's the Java integration whose not correctly managing the. So there's still a lot of work.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. But anyway, you have something, this is good.",
            "Sorry guys, we have to leave now.",
            "Yeah. Ok, so what is your main conlusion recall before you leaving from this test. What should we focus on.",
            "in the document is that I said I'm not quite understand the logic in the ASR, because it's giving us sentences in fragments So if it could talk to maybe they can change the way that this is present I think it will be helpful for us. But on a positive side, in term of efficiency it seem to be be able to handle ehm that stream that's coming in without empty worker.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm also quite happy with this speed that the subtitles appeared on PERSON11's screen. So that was good. I'm curious if this will scale up to the six or more target languages and the multipleinput. So this is something that we we should probably plan to test next week. To like test it with a whole all load with full number of inputs and full number of outputs.",
            "Yes, from yesterday I start working on the complete pipe. Then something from audio and also segmentation, translation and publication. And everything works fine. I'm, I will be on vacation next week a couple of days so I suggest to perform some massive test on Monday, so that I can provide you my support and we can check everything together.",
            "So which Monday are talking about? The very next",
            "Next Monday.",
            "So on in 4 days from now, right?",
            "Yep.",
            "So, yes, so during the day I'm available from like eleven to three. Is that a good time frame?",
            "Yeah. Yes for me it's fine.",
            "Which day?",
            "Monday. This very Monday. And I heard PERSON4 that PERSON4 is not available on Friday, right?",
            "Yes, that's right. I can I can make sure the worker is running, but probably won't be available to I'm not be able to go in meeting. Probably",
            "Yeah. Ok, so let's plan to have the same type of test call on Fri on Friday anyway. And PERSON3 you are available on Friday or not?",
            "Yes, I'm I should be back.",
            "Yeah, so let's plan Friday same time again. So we are actually starting and nine with the preparations. And then at ten we expect everyone who is available to to join. And PERSON4 will not be here. But hopefully all the workers will be running. And we'll. So PERSON2, will you be available next week?",
            "No, I'll be away next week.",
            "And PERSON10? Is so anyone from ORGANIZATION4 could be monitoring",
            "Next Friday should be available and I should be available to join Pexip, anyway.",
            "Yes. So it back It's will be Pexip because we want to relieve the workers. From the ORGANIZATION2 load. For the session. So what we will mostly need it to check the work load. If we try to run all the target languages. So we should come up with the set up that runs the ASR and connects all the machine translation into all the target languages. And the presentation platform should present all of these, ultimately. And we need to see if it where it where there are any workload issues. So it could happen everywhere. It could happen at the very first laptop, that does the sound recording. It could happen in the mediator, which I don't expect. It could happen at the ORGANIZATION4 side with the machine translation systems. Yeah, so it could happen anywhere. Ok, so I think that the ORGANIZATION4 people can can leave now, thank you very much for for your time today and thanks PERSON4 especially for for putting this worker together.",
            "I would just like to ask if you could get in touch directly with PERSON5 and make sure that they help you with the with segmentation input. I'm a little bit worried that there will be no time for improving this because it will be like creating new models and improving the underlink set up. It's not to me, it's probably not an issue of some rule based coding, but if it is, then it will be great to to know this. I think it would be rather some some models needed. For this improvement. So I'm afraid that we'll have to live with the current segmentation quality for the for the workshop. But please try, please get in touch with.",
            "Yeah. Ok, so thank you and maybe if PERSON3. PERSON3",
            "Thank you, bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye bye.",
            "Bye, bye.",
            "And PERSON3, you're still available for some time?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, that's good. So I think, we should try What what what can we try? We don't have access to the um, maybe you can, yes, if you know, you can tell us how to use the streaming from VLC that work for you. If you, if it work for you.",
            "We haven't found yet a solution",
            "Ok.",
            "of the tool prepare exactly an M3U8 starting from VLC.",
            "Yeah, ok, but is there Can you at least well, I don't recognize if you are else. So can you also paste to the document you are L of any stream on the web. Which has the same format as you are expecting? And we should try to mimic this.",
            "I can provide you the exactly the one including in the",
            "So that we know what we need to mimic. And what actually happened with the ban, it's still confusing to me. Because if I click play on the bunny stream",
            "It's not over, it does not start at some time, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so this is not a live It's like streaming for me, but not for everybody. It's not like broadcasting. I would like to avoid the the time time scale , well. The play should be only play and pause, but no way of jumping in time. So how does this work with real time streaming?",
            "Ok, in this case we have a playlist M3U8 actually already has all the ehm available chunks bit of chunks. And this is the reason why you are able to skip in time. Ehm, URL connected to realtime streaming is provide. Of course you will not have future video chance, you have just the right now chunk. And so you you will not be allowed to skipping time.",
            "All right, the M3U8 format it's it's ehm list all the currently available chunks and the browser goes, again and again, fetching the M3U8 file, right? And then it sees which part of the time is currently available and downloads those chunks and plays them.",
            "You should work exactly in this way. I'm not guru of streaming video streaming button, as far as I know, it works exactly this way. I brought the Google doc, the bunny M3U8 URL, you can use to test it. There is also ehm setting, a configuration languages displayed under the PROJECT1 logo,right?",
            "Exactly.",
            "And this is done on your side within like when starting this, right? Or is it on,no?",
            "It could be manage real time, when up is already running.",
            "Ok, so there is no way So it's clicking somewhere hidden and or how do I do it?",
            "of course you have to be registered, let's say to the system as administrator. In this case you see the ehm the main page, possible by each one has the browser.",
            "Well, I didn't follow, like I could follow it was difficult for me to understand. But",
            "Sorry, PERSON12. The configuration page where you are able to set the and the stream provided for each language. Is not available to each user.",
            "Ok.",
            "But",
            "ok. So in the meantime, PERSON4 said that he was, he made himself available on Slack. And I asked him to join the call. So maybe he'll join the call if if we're lucky. So if you have any questions on PERSON4, then he should appear here. But I'm not sure if if this is already happening. No, I don't see him yet. But that was half an hour ago when when he was available on Slack. And he's still like in green, but No, so? No. So, and Google,Firefox anywhere and Google Chrome on Windows. I think we should we should try to wrap up, so I would like to ask everybody who is still on the call, to go through the the current state of the Google document, and add whatever we have not recorded in the And make make the transcript or summary of the messages clear.",
            "So try to clean this document now. Because I'm afraid that we have seen many things, but we have not taken appropriate record of all of them. To clean this, clean this up now. Until PERSON4 appears, if he does. Google Chrome on Linux, ok. So PERSON3 you mentioned three issues with this with the presentation platform. .",
            "Yes, it's correct.",
            "So what was It was character in coding, subtitles not appearing, uh. And what else? What was the third one?",
            "We have to manage also character font size, and number of words displayed, of course. Because, well, the application it's dummy, it's simply displays what he recieves. But I'm managing it's in the ehm integration worker, which is the one who has the minus pub fingerprint. I believe we are working still on those things. We have not yet tested the multiple output, but should be pretty transparent. And I'm We haven't yet tested also the multiple sources for the same language. You know, for exampl",
            "yeah, yeah.",
            "The for example English subtitle with source Italian audio or German audio and so. This",
            "This is this is something which is  Yeah, but it's also like a design decision and I'm not sure how what is the current handling of of this. It Do we think it should be the final end users who would be like choosing which English they want to see, or should it be us selecting the best English for them?",
            "We will be ehm, there will be the administrators, then let's say who will use the",
            "Yeah, so, can we see the administration interface. Is that the same with the credentials where the configuration happens?",
            "Unfortunately, I'm not able Oh maybe it work,yes. The TU provider in email in order to access the",
            "No.",
            "Ok, then it's not possible. Because you have to register to the system, which actually means put I'm able to display it on my desktop, but I'm not able to",
            "You cannot share it.",
            "in Pexip, but it's I can, maybe I can provide you a snapshot.  Could be a solution,let me",
            "So, so is there a URL so that I would just type slash admin or something like that to force it to go to the admin screen?",
            "Exactly, the slash settings and",
            "So slash Yeah, so the slash admin does not exist but what It would be great if if this administrator web page would be simply like requested in the URL. So what I'm",
            "Yes, it is. I paste you the URL in the Slack livestream, but actually it requires the credential.",
            "You cannot add my admin now.",
            "Right now no, sorry.",
            "So can you is your password too secret or...",
            "No, I'm going to Well, act ok, try to put just my email, it asks just email.",
            "So I'll share, I'll start, sorry, I'll start sharing my screen so that you can verify if I'm doing it right. S end our screen, allow, so are you seeing my screen? Yes.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON3",
            "Dot PERSON3, perfect.",
            "Yeah, PERSON3 at Gmail dot com. Right?",
            "No, ORGANIZATION6",
            "ORGANIZATION6 dot com.",
            "Dot it.",
            "Dot it, ok. ORGANIZATION6 dot it. Log in. And worked.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Ok, excellent. So what what is this? There is this video, ok? So this can be changed. Yeah. I don't want to change the Bugs Bunny for now.",
            "There will be the default available languages which are displayed in the front page.",
            "So, we can already put here all the target languages that we are, that we are aiming at, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "So it will be also Czech, can someone dictate to me from the Google Doc. It's in the Google Doc if it's clow down. Czech, Polish, Hungarian, what else? I'll save it for now and default available So what is this available language sources? PERSON3.",
            "Ok, if at the moment the definition of sources is static, it's not dynamic, it's pretty difficult to define exactly the logic of joining services and living services we're still reasoning about it. But actually this will effect the next part of the configuration which is the one related to the language configuration. The sources are the audio sources.",
            "So, actually one think that I thought of during the call and have not taken any note on that. Is that we definitely need big grand map of all the fingerprints you are use through all the process. So we need to know what PERSON11 should ask for we need to know what the worker should be should register themself as, and then what should be displayed. So it's it's now like poppin pokin poppin popping up one by one, we we've learn that if we add dash pub it will be grabbed by the worker for the presentation platform. Do we have this grand map of of fingerprints anywhere?",
            "We have the we have admin web so we can we can see which workers are running and which fingerprints are they using.",
            "Yeah, but",
            "But we should have the map anyway.",
            "We need the map because it's different institutions who are starting the different workers and if they misregistered the worker if they use like mismatching fingerprint there is no way to make use of that worker.",
            "Yes.",
            "So PERSON3, you have sure experience with with the Slack maps. Should it be a picture or what it's what is the best layout for this?",
            "In order to have the list of all workers the list of input and output it's pretty, pretty much what we need, more important it",
            "No, no, it's like once we have the idea of what is being connected to what then we know what the inputs and outputs are and it's easy to use it. But the map is needed for the overall connection, what is connected to what. And this is what we are missing.",
            "And you run the for example the EB client, I know it's pretty much an old tool, but when you run it one of the first thing it displays is exactly the path selected. We have completed the in order to aset only exact path and through this",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "feature we can have a full control over selecting path.",
            "Yes, that's good. But what I'm saying is that if we don't have the map, and if someone from runs a worker with some incompatible fingerprint so that the worker from ORGANIZATION4 does not connect to it, then the path would not be accesible. There would be like gaps in the path. And we need",
            "fingerprints before the the 27 of June meeting.",
            "Yeah, so the point is that if there is a worker connected to the mediator, there is no way for us to change it's fingerprints. It registers with some particular fingerprints and these need to be compatible to to this surrounding workers.",
            "Actually that for the one who runs the client is is not available this information, and simply provides if so there is no logic implemented in order to ehm change fingerprints to worker, because worker who be there or not or will not be available or it's all delegated to who provides the service.",
            "But, but at least I created bridge worker, I updated the backend SMT worker so we can specify the fingerprints arguments and disconcert us bridge between workers. It's only copy place to source to target.",
            "Yeah, so that's the worst case for back solution.",
            "Yes, of course.",
            "But we should because it's it's sends the data to one more computer and back. So with the with the map, does Google, let's let's actually try with the drawing. So can I add No this is add an image Let's try, I'll try creating a new Google drawing document. Google drawings, that's it. And I'll try sharing with with you all. So fingerprints map, share, anyone with the link and edit. So I'm now putting link to this map to the Google doc. Try opening this as well. I'll I'll put it in two places. All this we haven't discuss this. PERSON3, are you making it to LOCATION1?",
            "Sorry.",
            "Are you going to LOCATION1 for the workshop? Did you talk to PERSON1,was he succesfully impersuading you?",
            "No, sorry, I really not be there, but actually it's really important for me to be here in order to check and provide you technicals.",
            "Yeah, yeah, ok. So, can anyone access the fingerprints map drawing now? So that we see Platform worker digest these fingerprints ENEU pub. So do you see this? Can you see the, yep. Ok,yeah. So there there is some, so PERSON3 have you also access that that document.",
            "I can see your screen shared.",
            "No, it would be better if you could access directly the document. And I heard someone",
            "Ok, I will try.",
            "So PERSON4 can see my screensharing but PERSON4 in the call, but he he disconnected again, it's confusing. He was not able to hear us. So please the way this drawing works is that you while you are editing an object, no one else sees it yet. So please create separate objects and do not edit, yeah. And do not edit the existing ones, so PERSON3 could you please put all the fingerprints of the languages that the presentation platform responds you next to he object that I just created? Like underneath.",
            "Ok, let me open it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It seems you have even to, even have to select different tool for it to appear for us.",
            "Ok.",
            "Just hitting enter it not seem to work. But now I see a blank text field from the anonymo anonymous alligator and that's filling right in. So I don't know what's going on.",
            "Ok, I add in a different object the at the moment available fingerprints but please consider that it's an instance running on my local pc.  Idea is to add just a minus pub to language",
            "But the German is different, and Italian is different, so the English is, English has EUN it's not like GB, so that's And we need the the full list of languages. So what I'm going to do now is that I'll paste the set of languages that we need to cover. Yep.",
            "I can, yeah you found it.",
            "I found it. So how do I So I'll actually paste Oh, so someone was faster.",
            "I did it. You can use it now.",
            "Yeah, so PERSON3 I'll paste it to your, oh this is too bad. And I cannot This doesn't really work. It's just too stupid.  It's simply too stupid. I pasted into the PERSON3's, yeah. So we need CSCZ pub, so PERSON3 is there any update on the presentation platform necessary to accept more more fingerprints?",
            "Yes you can reload the home page, you introduce new languages for example the Czech, the Hungarian, the Polish, PERSON6.  And if you see in the home page there are more languages available now.",
            "So the home page is this one, and I reload it, yes. So this is those that I introduced. And as so simply by adding these languages to this list, the worker, it's registering these new workers, right?",
            "It's not acting to the worker, it's acting only on the webpage, and it saying the language available for the, for the user. It's not",
            "Yeah but But backend also needs to know about them. So what is necessary in order to have the the languages as fingerprints the client can connect to and does give them the text.",
            "Client it's not connecting to the workers, it's just",
            "It is, it is, when PERSON11, when PERSON11 launches the client, I'll say the way I understand it, but you need to correct me if I'm wrong. So I think that PERSON11 launches EB client and tells EB client, here is some audio with this fingerprint it German audio, and I want the target fingerprint find me a path for that and my desired target fingerprint is Italian, Italian pub text. And the the EB client connects to the mediator and the mediator find the path and the path will include the worker which digest Italian text and produces Italian pub. And that's the worker",
            "Yes, PERSON12, we have to agree on whos playing the client role. I was talking about the this case.",
            "Ok.",
            "The publication the user browser is the client.",
            "And in this situation the client browser it's it's not connecting to the workers, it just recieves, recieves.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, yea, sorry.",
            "So my question, my original question was when changing here in, I'm still sharing the screen. So when I'm changing the set of languages and I'll add also the Spanish here, ES, this will affect obviously the buttons available on the front page. But there is no way that any Spanish can appear here until PERSON11 will run a pipeline which will end with Spanish pub. And for this pipeline to to be access if all the path to be accessible there has to be the worker registered already with it mediator that emits the Spanish Spain pub fingerprint that I'll put this fingerprint.",
            "Yes, yes exactly. The",
            "So what is necessary, yeah. What is necessary to do this, to to have this worker available in the mediator?",
            "In order to have the publication for example for the ehm Spanish language we have just to add it in our worker configuration. Of course the presentation worker, let's say would be run by ORGANIZATION6. We have just to configure all the require the worker and let them run it.",
            "Yeah, so please do it with the set of languages that we need for the So it's now fingerprint. So I Well I'm making these up, so I'm not sure If I'm If is this standard So for English we are using the EU, for for Dutch it's spoken in Belgium and the Netherlands should we also use the ORGANIZATION5?",
            "Well, it's just a matter of for me.",
            "So you don't care. And you have no",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, so and let's also do the French ORGANIZATION5 pub right? Because we have, we don't have any French? We're not sure.",
            "We have the names of the participants. They're, we can't exactly ask them about their So the only way you can do is use the same",
            "So could you do it?",
            "Nah, I won't. I don't want to have anything with social media. Sorry.",
            "No, just Google for their names. Or the names if they sound french, then we have to",
            "Well, to my collegue they sound non french.",
            "Non french.",
            "Because I don't know how to translate",
            "Yeah, vlamish.",
            "Sorry, sorry PERSON12. The developmenting is asking me if you're running Windows ten.",
            "No, I'm running Linux.",
            "You're running Linux, ok.",
            "PERSON9 I cannot hear you now from the Pexip. I'm and tell us about your Windows version.",
            "This thing is Windows 10 and this is Windows 7, but does not have a microphone with, so it's not running.",
            "Yeah, but for the,and you have tried and you have Google Chrome on which of those?",
            "I think on both.",
            "And there is still not hearing anymore?",
            "No I don't have it here.",
            "Does it work on Chromium?",
            "You guys of course the browser, maybe it's related to Windows firewall but you are running Linux, we have to check it, ok. Actually it work also on my mobile device, so maybe you can try with your Android device to connect to the presentation platform by using browser. It should be already optimize for also mobile mobile usage. But this this problem with Windows has confused me, because al me you, me too I usually work on Linux and it works pretty well in my situation, maybe it's something related also to as your firewall we have to check it.",
            "Because I have, on the Windows 7, I'm to NLT connection and that should not be too many firewalls in the way. And then also not seeing it. By the way, for the optimization I I was wondering if I have bigger screen, now the slides are quite small. But there be option to make it bigger? Because as of now this is hardly hardly awesome.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm, I'm sharing the screen, I'll share my camera instead. I'll stop sharing my screen, how do I, stop that.",
            "It's small.",
            "Thank you.",
            "I'll stop sharing my screen but PERSON9 show this. So this is what the participants are eventually are going to see. They will sit in front of a notebook, each one of them and they will see the subtitles and the slides. And the slides are reduced way too much. So the full screen is not sufficiant default screen, that's the question. Essentially.",
            "Yeah, and there's a lot of blank blue space.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which definitely could be reduce when there is only one line of subtitles.",
            "So PERSON9 could hit as eleven or twelve",
            "Sorry could you",
            "And now it's even worse.",
            "Yeah, so this is this is the full screen mode of the web browser, what you're seeing in the webcam from my Pexip, right? And that's the view of what the participants at the workshop would see. And we would like to make use better use of the space of the screen. So we would like the stream video to take configurable or at least much larger space of the screen.",
            "Ok, we can reason about it. I think it's optimize in relation to the mobile usage, because mobile will probably require more space for for subtitles.",
            "For the subtitles. Yeah, so can you, this is some CSS fighting. So, so can you make sure it's for the workshop in two weeks now, it's more important to have it optimized for the desktop rather than for the mobile phone.",
            "Ok, ok.",
            "But",
            "I write it immediately.",
            "Yeah. I'll try actually PROJECT1 dot ORGANIZATION6 dot com.",
            "Also small given the small set of languages now",
            "So this is my, this is my screen and also I think it's like not really So the Bugs works yes, it's good. It's Firefox, but I'll try to rotating it.",
            "That's even worse.",
            "But I can scroll it. So actually after scrolling this is probably the what's it optimize for at the moment, right? Do you agree PERSON3?",
            "That's probably the wrong way, it would be better to have it optimized for being vertical, because then you have space for the subtitles. Now you are just, yeah.",
            "So PERSON3 are",
            "Yes, as I told you we are working much more on functionality than on the",
            "That's We're not complaining, so it's, I wanted to say this up front. It's it's great what you have already. We're, but we're thinking what what are the minimum changes that would make it like much more usable with as little effort as you have. So, I think it's usable in the in the horizontal mode because then there is more, it's it's hard to say where is more space.",
            "Depends on how many languages you will want to see.",
            "Mmm exactly. Yeah. So maybe I think you can for the cell phone usage it looks really good to me. I think it would be ok already now. For the desktops it would be better to to have the subt the video larger.",
            "And it seems it works for the cellphone very well that it adapts to the size of the screen, I wonder why does the same code cannot be used on the desktop.",
            "Well, you know it's different, the browser used on the mobile phone probably. Well, actu I think probably at the moment the CSS is operate the same we have to introduce",
            "To different ones.",
            "And I'm I'm not webdesigner",
            "Yeah.",
            "But for the, this is the issue. If you like to have a bigger video screen text, I can note and I will ask them.",
            "Yes. I think",
            "Available for June.",
            "Yeah, the shortest version of this request would be to not limit the with of the slides rectangle on the desktop. It should also happily use the whole the full width of of that. Of the screen",
            "But",
            "There's there's the subtitles will be below that.",
            "Exactly. The problem is to let still the subtitle to be displayed. You also asked for having at least, well at the most using 2 languages available.",
            "And you support many more, which is good, I like that.",
            "Yes, it's pretty, it's it's nice, but of course they will require some kind of space. Yesterday we actually we tried for the full screen mode to prepare let's say a kind of overlapping, you know the the, but we haven't found a solution and it's actually it's it's nothing in problem to, to develop it. And not not for June, I'm sorry. But we reason about it.",
            "Yeah, and when I'm thinking of is, can you, could you, could you share with us the code for the not all, maybe maybe not all of the presentation platform but like the bare bones which has the text thing, like the logic that converse the the words to where is that being displayed? So, because you mention the number of where is that should be displayed. So there is some logic in your set up. So this",
            "It's not the idea presentation platform the worker, in the worker logic. I'm not allowed to share the whole worker logic because actually we have a really complex project. And it's difficult to explain to someone else also how how it work. But I can prepare some kind of snippet and I can share them for sure.",
            "So the reason I'm asking for this is the clie the console client presentation platform. Something which we could launch ourselves and the only thing it will be doing would be showing the text in terminal window. And this is something that would help us to to use the video mixer if we use some transparent transparent ehm terminal on green screen. So like extracting this worker logic from your worker of the presentation platform would be very useful for for us. For the purposes of of the video mixing. Because it we we could make it clie console operation worker.",
            "I'm reasoning about it because at the moment, the the worker, the publi the publication worker returns exactly the packet recieved and not the one published. But maybe it could send back the published subtitles so that you can catch the subtitle directly from the the client running.",
            "That's right, yes.",
            "The idea. Ok.",
            "Or maybe, maybe it's if it's easy I don't know how easy is it in the code, but if you could register the worker when you're starting the worker that feeds the presentation platform. If it could register itself twice, once by pro offering the dash pub thing, and that would be only copying thing exactly, and the other one would be like dash pub presented or whatever and that would be thing. Is that possible? So that the same worker would offer two output, one would be so that you can connect it and it doesn't change the the stream and the other one would be the one that we could then directly use as the console client.",
            "I have to reason about it, I'm not sure about the answer, sorry.",
            "What is Yeah, ok. So is there still anything that we need to discuss? So I think the most important thing for now is the map of the fingerprints. I'm not sharing my screen, I'll start sharing my screen again.",
            "Oh, yes. We'll be preparing the map.",
            "Yes. Allow. So I'm sharing my screen. So I think we need to make sure this set of languages is is there. And we need everybody, so I'll ask everyone on the call today at 1 to contribute to this map and everybody needs to check that their workers are like signing themself with the right, with the right fingerprints.",
            "Yes, please consider that at the moment, the publication worker it's running on my local PC. When it will be sufficiently stable it will be deployed on asure. So please don't run a lot of test with it, because I'm also debugging and checking this functionality. So in general",
            "Ok.",
            "In general I suggest you to forget about the presentation platform till Monday. So we can test and improve the functionality. And also check these nasty things of browser, Windows, so whatever.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Firewalls and whatever.",
            "Ok. So I think we're we should stop the call. Like I don't know how about you but I'm I'm getting exhausted. For, and I'm not sure if PERSON4 is here if he can hear us or not. Yeah, well.",
            "For Monday we say we say the time which was from?",
            "11.",
            "Ok.",
            "So I'll actually put it right into the at the beginning of this call. So Monday, and it will be what would be the date on Monday. Yeah, 17 6, and only only and PERSON3 expected and the goal for Monday was to test more languages in presentation platform. Or what was the",
            "Well, since I will not be available for part of the week, maybe we can try to let's say everything we have to check on Friday. So the multiple language fingerprint path selection and hopefully, of course the multiple publishing system on the presentation platform.",
            "Yeah and also custom different video. Different video streams.",
            "Ok.",
            "And the goal for Friday was the full work allow needed. I all audio inputs and all target languages in the presentation platform, right? I'm now editing the top, you're seeing it in in my screeshare I guess. Yeah, so here PERSON2 and PERSON4 will be absent. Everyone else please come. Ok. I think that's it, right? We also need a break before the main. So Tyso, yeah so PERSON4, were you here? We don't know. I I saw PERSON4 for a while, I'm not sure if he was here at all. Yeah. So PERSON3 thanks a lot. PERSON4 if you are here, thank you as well. But may with PERSON3",
            "Yes. I'm sorry it didn't work today, but actually",
            "That's it's no no, you're pretty fire, this is perfect. This is this is very good, like I'm not really relieved yet, but I'm not anymore nervous that I was before. Actually, quite on the contrarily. So that's that's good. Ok so thanks a lot and talk to you on Monday. And try to clean up the Google document this one, on the prepare to the calls if I misunderstood something or if if there's if some of the notes don't make sense please make it explicit so that we,yeah. So that we know what is what is happening. Ok, Thank you PERSON3, I'll close the call now if I'm able to and we start packing things here.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye bye."

            "Ha. So here in LOCATION1, we have to wait until the 4th of May, some commercial activity can already be open. But we think that we have to wait until June for the free circulation of people. And fortunately, starting from the 4th of June we are allowed to reach our family. If it's in the same region.",
            "Ehm.",
            "And so finally, I will reach my parents. Cause we live in two different cities. Because I'm in Trento and my family is in Bolzano. Which is pretty near around 50 kilometres. But, but",
            "So you're looking forward.",

            "Morning.",
            "So I went to the park yestreday and I was really happy. I mean I kept my distance from everyone but like it was green there. So it was .",
            "But you can't go to the forest or something?",
            "Hmm?",
            "You can't just go to the forest or something?",
            "Well, the rules changed here and since this Monday we can't go out even if it is not like the most necessary groceries or stuff like this, and .",
            "Okay.",

            "And thanks we are able to go out to the forest, whenever we wanted.",
            "Yes, but if you are in the city then you have to somehow get to the forest, so .",

            "Yeah, okay.",
            "And ORGANIZATION3 is not coming.",
            "Yeah. So we have every partner. A partner from everywhere, that thats great. Thanks for joining. So this is again one of our regular calls. There will be, before the summer, there will be at least one more, uh, in May. Oh no, two more actually. One in May and one in June, and . Let maybe PERSON11 should start with the administrative part. Yeah. So, PERSON11, can you? You know the review day, then all this .",
            "Okay, so, we. PERSON7 told us that we will have to postpone one of our regular meeting. And she asked us about dates. So I already set it up. Well. Not many people voted in that Doodle. So, please vote for the postpone review. It should be in September. I know that nobody knows so litheraly if will be able to travel somewhere, and it looks like that it will be just online meeting. But, anyway just vote in a Doodle so I can get PERSON7 some dates. So, just do your best estimates for September. And that's it for that. We have we will have eh couple of deliverables due in June. I've link there in the in that Google sheet we have for tricking our like deliverables or stuff. We have the links for overview. So for these six up coming once you can basically start working on them.",
            "We haven't decided who will be our internal review person for any of them. .",
            "Which is a good opportunity to choose them now.",
            "Yes. So just have a look. And if it's not your deliverable and you would like to read it just tell me.",
            "So we will be contribute . So I think that the the two point one, the initial ASR systems ORGANIZATION1 is not providing in ASR system. And that's a technical We are providing some. So it will be good if if ORGANIZATION1 review that. So actually PERSON10 the . The volunteer should be entered in the continues reporting. She not not in this table just copy copypasted.",
            "You can you can enter it here and I will just put it into the right place. You can just .",
            "Okay, I'm gonna last review the summarization. But generally, there ASR also interesting for me. So probably put down PERSON10.",
            "Yeah. So I don't know, who should we the summarization eh review. Then that's another.",
            "Ehmm.",
            "So .",
            "I think we're not contributing that don't know facts.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There we should wouldn't not this stage.",
            "Okay, I would be happy to do the review.",
            "Okay, rage. What can we review? Is there anything that we can review?",
            "That's a problem we contribute everything.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And for this D7 2 do I understand correctly, PERSON11, please correct me. I think that we should ask for an extension for this deliver because Congress has not taken place.",
            "Yes.",
            "So actually, I hope that this one will not be needed. So .",
            "Yes, we will have to chec check it with PERSON7.",
            "So, who is gonna review three point one, cause I'm hoping that everyone only the universe is contributing three point one.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So maybe maybe ORGANIZATION5 would be just a placed.",
            "Exactly, yeah. Because ORGANIZATION5 is also developing their own systems in this area.",
            "Yeah.",
            "There . So it would be great if ORGANIZATION5 did it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, you can sign",
            "Let me down the check, okay?",
            "Ehm.",
            "Ah, Okay.",
            "So PERSON13 should we list your name or not? Or you will let us know?",
            "Eh, I will let you know.",
            "Yeah, okay. So lets put PERSON13 with two question marks. Okay. And then, then the management guy .",
            "Well, I think I could I could . Well, the dissemination activities I could do that but if we are not . But I'm also doing the dissemination on the web and stuff like that.",
            "Hmm, I don't think there will be too too much of a problem. So I think that that that little should be like cross reviewed between ORGANIZATION3 and us. So we should review what they wrote and they should review what we wrote.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So, PERSON11, write yourself as the reviewer and",
            "So I will put here PERSON11 plus PERSON3.",
            "Yeah, and I have no idea of this project management guide is again.",
            "I'm",
            "I think that will be checked an update.",
            "No no, there is no, there wasn't any, anything like that before.",
            "Oh, this is the .",
            "Sum it . And this is the first one. So I'm apparently writing it.",
            "Okay.",
            "And it will be a lot of lot of words about nothing but yes. Yes.",
            "I'm afraid so.",
            "So who wants who wants to read a fairy tale.",
            "So the the best position would be I think ORGANIZATION1, because they have coordinated a number of projects.",
            "I'm much rather read about ASR systems.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, not that keen on reading it to be honest.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I could, you know, I could say we have to if it's not many words. PERSON11 said it'll be lots of words.",
            "Yes, PERSON11, please cut down the number of words.",
            "Like I think will run out of idea what to write there. So it won't be really long.",
            "Okay. But maybe .",
            "But there must be, there must be some project management guide from previous project.",
            "I don't have it. So if you do you send to me.",
            "I, I do not know, I think we managed to avoid such a thing before.",
            "Why do we have it even?",
            "Even I do remember writing it on.",
            "Mmhmm.",
            "Yeah well. Wasn't there anything like that from QT21 for example? I'll search.",
            "I mean. Yesterday I search in PROJECT2 like what is the description of this of this deliverable, and it says just czech management guide. There is no description.",
            "And this is the first iteration of that, is it?",
            "Yes. It is.",
            "And how it could be managing without project management guide so far if we don't . 15 months.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I mean, with PERSON8 we are awesome obviously. We can manage the project even without a guide.",
            "Yeah, it's just a party, they do do what they're expected to do even without the managing them. So that.",
            "An exercise is so organized.",
            "Yeah, exactly, that's that's what PERSON9 can has always said I also believe in selforganization. Hm so QT21 doesn't seem to have this. They have this period reports and data management plans but not the project management guides.",
            "And and",
            "I don't remember such a thing, no.",
            "So it probably it was copypasted from something from somewhere. And no whatever .",
            "Yeah, I don't remember.",
            "Okay, anyway, I'll write something and someone then will review it.",
            "So another thing is like who would like to coordinate future projects. Those people should also have some a little incentive to to read it. So is any partner planning to do like start . Anyone who was not coordinated the projects yet. We could even ask ORGANIZATION3 to to review that because there . So that they would finally know what like what these EU projects are about. Yeah.",
            "Okay, we can decided slowlier.",
            "Yeah. So it is important that they do start writing and the the due date has not been shifting. So that would be the end of June. So the internal reviews should be ready by mid June at the latest. So that we have two weeks to finish that.",
            "Can you give us a date? Mid June seems kind of late.",
            "Okay, yes, exactly. Yeah, let's do it earlier.",
            "Especially things usually slept.",
            "Yep, yeah, yeah. So the 8th, the 8th of June.",
            "Yeah, that sounds fine.",
            "So that should be the end of the review, kind of, right? Or no. It shou No, sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah. The beginning, the beginning. This should be delay. Yeah, yeah.",
            "It is the first draft.",
            "First draft, yes, but complete draft. Yeah, So then you basically have a week reviewer two week to fix it.",
            "Exactly yeah.",
            "And a week for no further every week spare",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "For for final tracks from the coordinator.",
            "Yeah, okay, that looks good. So, then the milestone. So the previous milestones of talk to PERSON5 in the email that you seen that of the milestones claiming that we have all the complete set up for ORGANIZATION4 Congress, which technically we have. So, yeah. And there is one more milestone, the Congress. And PERSON5 said that there is no need to like think that of specifically, because, well, it won't happen yet. So we will take it off in that year from from now. So .",
            "Yes and another. Ehmm. Another another the most earlier milestone is in December. So . Do we find have anyone milestone in December. And there will be. I forgot to put the the one more deliverable. That will be due in the end of August. And that's the year 2 test set. So, that will be .",
            "Yeah. So the test sets, this is something that we are building.  We call it the PROJECT1 test sets. So it is, I think the the main responsible for this deliverable is ORGANIZATION1, right?",
            "Mmhmm.",
            "Yeah. So PERSON9 please, I have started this PROJECT1 test sets some time ago. You know, where the repository lives. So please pick up on that, and hopefully will not be like too confused from the layout of the of that test set and also that you would not disagree too much with the ambition that I have there. So it's, so this is this is technical thing no that me and PERSON9 should discuss. But uh, like my my idea is that we should have this populated and described by the August date. So that the we can then easily like submit as a deliver. So if the if you want test sets are not part of this yet and I think they should be. Uh, so wish put them in, and we should put all the other languages, and and everything. And we should also tested with our pipelines regularly.",
            "And the layout for for those who are not following these details these the layout of the test sets is that. It's many documents, uh, and depending on the availablity of the document. Some of the languages are available. Sometimes it's also ASR test set. So, sometimes there is also the speech. Sometimes that just runs quick. Sometimes there is, there is the. Eeeh, that that was PERSON2, sorry. There is another meeting happening and I can't answer him now. So, it is and kind of assorted collection of documents in terms of languages, and like modality the speech, or or the text. And whenever someone wants to test against it. They will select a subset of files which have the require set of languages. So the test sets consists of these raw documents, obviously, curated to to serve well, linebay, segmented, everything. But the actual set of documents that you will test against will depend on the set of languages that you want to test.",
            "So the part of this repository is directory of file lists. And these file lists are then the subset of of that. .",
            "So this is the WMT 20 PROJECT1 test you are talking about, or?",
            "No.",
            "No, sorry.",
            "This is, this is PROJECT1 test set. Do you see that?",
            "Got it. Ou, Yeah.",
            "So please, this is like the the starting point. And I have PERSON12 PERSON12 just should be really of like of coordinating annotators. The annotators are searching for poll documents and in many of the languages. We've asked that we have to have included more people we have any more people to the language map. And we have short term agreements with them. Unfortunately, PERSON12 is not feeding them with the prepared automatically paralyzed files. Uh, so that they would review them, because he is very slow, and he is also not soliciting new links from them. So that is it is. It is a growing much slower than I wanted to. We have enough time for August. But if we were really wanting this for the ORGANIZATION4 Congress we will be in in a bit of trouble.",
            "So wa was the August the August just the low deliverable of the year 2 test set, is that right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Ehm.",
            "Yeah, okay. And these are, okay So these are documents or sentences or speech. It is everything really?",
            "Yeah, yeah. It is everything, but if everything is curated. So it is like constraint, when when when finished, they all should be curated for the part particle purpose. So if it's the speech type of test set. It will be the sound, and the transcript with timestamps of individual words. That's what we are trying. We called it forced alignment. Sometimes we have to do it manually because the the the forced alignment automatic one fails. And if it's the machine translation test set then it's the standard poll think, ideally documents. We are trying to have documents, but sometimes it is the line oriented. So it needs to some still some clarification, like how do we like name the files. And then there is the file lists. And ideally, there would be automatic checks so that the everybody could check out this repository and run these checks. And then uh, with uh.",
            "It would check the number of lines, the the length of the non emptiness, and everything all the format things. And also it would automatically be able to create the file lists. So the file list should be essentially like fine graph. Uh, you you for those who like a clever fine graph so that you list all the files, and check that you have all the languages that you want. And with this fine graph the result of the set of files that that you can test on. And that should be stored there as a fixed file list, so then in order to evaluate with the test set you would say I'm for the evaluation I use this particular version of my model, whatever, and I use this commit ID of PROJECT1 test set with this file list. And that uniquely defines what is what is the test set.",
            "And obviously, some of these subsets would be like stable ones. So that we we would really have like there could be a file list cord called year 2 SLT test set. And year 2 empty test set and year 2 ASR test set. But that it would gradually grow as we will be covering more and more languages. .",
            "Mmhmm. Yeah. Okay.",
            "So it's . It can be seen as an overkill but .",
            "And could be so suffered text to text can I do someone like sacrebleu or use well.",
            "So this is this defines just the data and not the evaluation metric and that's a separatelly.",
            "That, that and some some as a true, um, but sacrebleu has a way to just yet be a text.",
            "So that would be a nice extension of sacrebleu, so that we could like add like FLAC to sacrebleu PROJECT1 test set and then the the file list name uh, and it would do automatical downloaded and it would put the commit ID the current commit ID into the fingerprint.",
            "Yeah, and I, I have observed that Max apps test sets really quickly to sacrebleu. Okay, yeah, um, whether he was not all test set from PERSON7. I'm not sure.",
            "I mean, it's a little.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "And so so the I think it would be better to kind of avoid forks, because then the versioning is is confused. But I'm totally agree that the public use of these test sets, the should be limited to few of those. And I think that the file list are the concept to use for this. So the the file list, and uh, that there should be only 3 at most 3 file lists that are interesting for the general public.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But we need, whatever we need the particle, computational linguistics domain. We need the auditing domain. We need the text audits versus speech audits domain.",
            "Hmm.",
            "So I think that for the for the general public there should be just at most 3 file lists. They could grow in time, the fingerprint would then it clearly indicate which which version was used. And it would be downloadable by sacrebleu automatically. I can't hear you. There u something happen. Yeah.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. That all seems good. Emm, I mean, I mean, the sacrebleu, I mean, I was insane added sacrebleu. I just mean this kind of approach is very useful cause it makes it very easy.",
            "Yeah. So for the evaluation it's for the tool, we're still working on the SLTF, which is a private repository and you can see it, but it will be public wants finally finalize it. And it's it is now under like have it testing for the audible SLT share task evaluation.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So, we will know how the various scores behave. And it's this is geared towards the evaluation of spoken language translation, and it has kind of a mode, where it doesn't need a translation. So it's only ASR evaluation. The SLTF, ideally would be the sacrebleu for spoken English translation.",
            "Yeah, okay. I mean that . This is more interesting to me, because mean, essentially, I know I know how to text evaluation marks. And I know that's you just have some test sets you run you run whatever. Spoken language translation is a bit more but nearer to me. And then we have these these problems are and simultaneous translation. Yeah, of an effect on the button translation.",
            "people I try to reconnecting if you needs.",
            "Okay. Yeah. PERSON15. Yeah, PERSON15 please go on.",
            "spoken translation evaluation effect to reward the same unless you need symetrics.",
            "We do include latency. So SLTF does include delay and latency and and also the well the wasted effort. So there is two measures of wasted effort.",
            "I haven't done that task on IWSLT to you .",
            "So .",
            "It was boring thing integrate the model itself to the wrong model and and watch the output or .",
            "No it trust it trust the it trust the time stamps given by the participants. And in our case, we actually all we said that the primary evaluation will be the translation quality, and the ASR and translation quality regardless the delaying. So we also have submissions who do not include any time stamps, uh, the the the others. So it is like a secondary thing. It was not not a requirement for the audible SLT task this year. But I can imagine then in the next year, we would maybe even try running the model, so that this is a this is hard to run the models. But maybe we would really force everyone to submit time stamp information.",
            "Hmm, hmm.",
            "So this is, for us, we need it in any case. So the SLTF should serve us like what is ideal set up. Evaluating latency.",
            "Yeah, I have strong preference not to submit my model to eh",
            "Ehmm.",
            "To organizers to run it for one, because the unpublished code",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because it's python code I have no choice, but to send the actual source code. And yahoo it's not a problem and, I would prefer just send the sour eh the lock file we have to do, because with the something in translation task and probably the SLT and I was not able do that.",
            "Okay, but I mean, I mean how else do you . I mean if you want to save varieties these places is cautios so now, do you? How do you set this up?",
            "I mean, so used that's for lock former time stamps.",
            "Yes, this is exactly what we did for these for desirability to tasks it. It is quite clear, this cries what the lock file shouldn't lying.",
            "Mmhmm.",
            "And then you trust the the participants.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And there could be many lay. So this is all is risky with the lock files, because people still can misinterpret what time stamps should they use. So we try to be very clear about like this is the time when the the award was starting to be authored. This is the time when the word stopped to be authored. And this is the time when its ASR was available like printed on the screen for the user. And this is the time when the translation appeared on screen for the user. But people can misinterpret and also the the forced alignment that we're running. Eh, so so the so the the one people misinterpret it then someone's results can be like shifted in bad ways. So these measures will be always on the reliable, the only way to to do the comparison really fairly is to run the models or a serve the model.",
            "So that people with really live, receive the the sound, and they would like in in in actual networks sockets provide the the outputs. So this would be the only reliable way to to measure that. The the extra thing that I wanted to mention is that the forced alignment, which finds the words in the in the sound is not reliable for us either. So sometimes it is really shifted. Sometimes it is towards the ends of the word. Sometimes it is toward the beginning of the words. It's in your own network model that like attention somewhat flows. It's not attention but it still somewhat floats, floats around. And the the the only thing that the one can say to this is the this at least affects everybody the same way. When people misinterpret what the locks should be. Then everybody's like each party is affected in a different way, and that's bad for the for the evaluation.",
            "But I think that's like that just life. So I think it is, it is quite easy to proceed with a with these limitations and what the set up. So so the so ORGANIZATION1 people please review the PROJECT1 test set, as I set it up and please contribute to it in any possible way. You remember that some at the several months ago of of I suggested that you can ask your students and and PERSON10 said that well we cannot expect volunteers eeh possibly paid volunteers or nonpaid volunteers that that makes some different, but not to it to to just do slavery task on the data. Maybe you can find someone who can do it if you can paid them. That's okay, I'm not curious. .",
            "Sorry just reminded the task is what? One is cur is checking the translations are making translations or?",
            "We do both. So.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So well, we we plan to do both we. We try to uh, find, and the and the revised translations.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And and this, if I was correct PERSON11 I do not know whether you have double checked my numbers. But it turns, it seems that finding and curating is half the price when we pay what we pay to our annotators normally compared to like the professional translation. So there is some reduction of costs but is . It's not like it doesn't come for free anyway.",
            "No, no.",
            "One could, one could . Yeah, it is war. And one one could just trust the automatic processing and maybe use some quality automatic quality measures. So one could could cut it down further. But for now, I prefer, especially because is this kind of obscure languages. I prefer to find people who actually speak them, and I preferred them to to find the related data sets. But if we are unable to to find speech domain and auditing domain. Then indeed, we will ask the people to find these text monolingually and translated maybe back to Czech. So do manual back translation to Czech. This is the the wrong direction of translation. But it's the it's more reliable with respect the domain of interest.",
            "In in terms of finding the translation I mean we and PERSON9 maybe can comment. We made some progress in getting translations out of the auditing websites, ehmm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And that if that is what we are looking for pro tests about is nonspeech segments, that some text insistent. This is that.",
            "Yeah. So this is relevant. And this is this is what we really should do. Uh, the current people, those that we have have just like signed up work agreements, the short term contracts with uh, our four languages, which are not well represented there, so far. But we also want to do it for the well represented languages, because we should we should cover them as well. So so PERSON12 sh PERSON12 has, for example, link to one great site of of speeches and he should run by textor and they and he.",
            "We can also work on this and for a lot of Irish state. If you are under represent to languages.",
            "Yeah.",
            "The Irish supreme auditor, apparently translates lot everything into Irish.",
            "Okay.",
            "And doesn't very . It wasn't very structured way wasn't it though?",
            "Yeah, we got, ehm, what was it? And ten tens of thousands of sentences I think. Yeah.",
            "Ehm.",
            "We assume that Irish was not huge priority for the project, um. But yeah.",
            "Well, Irish is equally equal priority with as other languages.",
            "Eh yeah, currently. Yeah.",
            "Yeah, well, the project was started when the EU still existed.  So we will see what happened. Yeah, yeah.",
            "Okay, there is one more point and we promised half hour call so.",
            "Yes, so exactly",
            "Right.",
            "Yes, with this is that the finishes, the set of feel free to step in, and whatever you can do for PERSON12 that will help us then the next person when PERSON12 is still not like woken up is PERSON6 who is now finishing the overview of the audible SLT test set. And he will be moving to to to these like supervision and managing the the annotators for the PROJECT1 test set if if PERSON12 doesn't start really. And, but feel free to step in and provide feedback on the layout, upload data sets everything. So let's let's get this grow. And if we if we do this over the following couple of weeks. Then and if we test with these test sets then it will be very easy to do the deliverable for August. Yeah. And the last point now, that's the demo. So here I would I was I was hoping that PERSON13 would would reconnect by this time.",
            "And yes maybe he is here. I'm not sure. .",
            "Yes I'm here.",
            "Yeah, yeah. So would it be possible that that ORGANIZATION5 would would like manage and make sure that this demo is delivered? As as the integration part. Obviously, like it's we will be PERSON2 will be running the systems. But I I need someone to to make sure that these things happen. Because I'm like overloaded and you're the integration partner. So that's that's the the general question at the beginning. And maybe let's wait with the answer until I tell you whatever we know about this. Uh, there is no particular requests for the scenario. As far as I know PERSON5 has just answered and they have also provided some feedback and that's interesting for everybody. So they've they've reminded us off BBC guidelines and standards for subtitling, which we are aware off, but they are not reflected in our systems in in any way. And then the better captioning or as spoken text translation ehm on screen will make better translation and readability, recomposing sentence on the fly my ethic liability.",
            "So so in a sense this is not the first time I hear that the users are always afraid of what ORGANIZATION7 is working on for for the past years. So ORGANIZATION7 has been working on this retranslation approach. And the users seem to uh, to prefer a delay. Yeah, okay, so so maybe maybe ORGANIZATION7 has already experience with defending their approach to the users. I keep. .",
            "This is the segmentation as opposed to the, you mean, the segmentation and",
            "ASR have focused on resending.",
            "Ahh, okay, the retranslation, right.",
            "The retranslation, yes. I think the users are afraid of retranslation because we were not able to hide it sufficiently. If we are able to make the retranslation stable. Then the users will not complain.",
            "Yeah, I mean, we've been playing with this and we can certainly improve the stability. Um, I mean we only tested this simulator ASR which talking this morning about trying to get more testing the ASR. Yeah, if you're doing retranslation you're never going to be up to completely make it stable without actually messing up the end performs. It's sort of a trade off.",
            "Yeah, it is a it is a trade off. So. I think that in the long term I would like this to be evaluated on humans towards the end of the project we we we would really have like user study that would be great to to see which, and I think there will be people of different groups. Some will prefer this some will prefer that uh",
            "Should be do this at the end or should be do this a bit sooner?",
            "Any time we have the time for that.",
            "Okay. Well, I mean it it's a question that's it's a question of making the time. I mean, yeah, it's whether we see it as a priority or not.",
            "So it's that's a good idea. So we're now in the, in which of the project, it's where in the middle of the project, right.",
            "In the middle.",
            "So ehmm",
            "I mean immediately end and say ou, we should retranslations a terrible idea. We should do less of it or we get the end and say retranslations is briliant. We should, you know, when you care about this. We we probably are not learn up before the end.",
            "That's right.",
            "But I agree that way we for this. And I do not know.",
            "Well, okay. So little bit respect on this, I'm not an ASR person so probably PERSON9 could more about this. But it's entirely possible that retranslation go go back a lot with the transition to endtoend ASR.",
            "Ehmm.",
            "Because of course the the unstable have are based on which our research. Multiplies already to the high get models. So it's entirely possible that pressure answer. So because we decided to go to the end the data.",
            "That you still have . We would still have instability. The MT is all also gonna inject instability, isn't it.",
            "No. The MT only translate will be get from ASR. Like every hand is also changes, we have changes otherwise that we have.",
            "Yeah, so that injects instability. So the MT .",
            "If there are no updated ASR hypothesis then they MT hypothesis.",
            "Okay, so if the ASR wait to the end of the sentence before sending his hypothesis. Then obviously this know instability.",
            "partial sentences.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's probably just going to get better as we train models in fact. We have lot .",
            "The search group, yeah.",
            "We will have our new generation of eh models previously based transformers finally in direct translator. And so far the experience from actual lectures is that there is a big improvement.",
            "Ehmm. Still I underst .",
            "And this is how much improvements is for flickering and every translation support generally, the quality is.",
            "Sorry, sorry. Go on. So I was I was double checking. PERSON15, you were saying that with the in the endtoend SLT which includes transform models now in the new generation. There is, no, no.",
            "Not internal SLT.",
            "Okay, no internal SLT. Yeah, okay.",
            "And endtoend ASR. I think he means.",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay, endtoend ASR. So, endtoend ASR there is no partial sentences admitted. It would be only complete sentences admitted. Is that what you say?",
            "because that's not my field. I think there is a lot of research right now.",
            "Sorry, connection.",
            "Oh, I'm sorry. There is research going on right now. How to low latency, and when they ASR and right now. We do get a partial sentences, but I don't think the hypothesis updated as much.",
            "So they don't change, but they still extend. You know it doesn't rewrite extends.",
            "much.",
            "But even even extending could still could still lead flickering the MT it's like you listen to German. If you listen to German, you don't know what the verb it so you make prediction and reproduction wrong. German to English say, you don't know the verb is in the sentence predictor wrongly, or you could just wait, but maybe that's bad to.",
            "Yeah. Exactly. So this is, I think the the problem with the integration of the ASR and MT will remain even once the uh, the new generation of the ASR models is is there. And there will be the question for the users whether they preferred to wait for the German verb, or guess and put there some English verb. So there there would be a trade off like what and what confidence should I insert the verb and then maybe recovery. I'm sure that there is also ways in English in which you can still .",
            "you can find examples and languages and say.",
            "No, no, no. I mean, that you could recover from that",
            "To preforma, yeah, yeah.",
            "To preserve the stability and reintroduce some kind of correction.",
            "So why I wonder this when you could to look what interpreters do. Cause they just have strategies for doing this, the massive strategies where they serve formulate the the speech and serve wheter the is open, but I don't know the computation like. And then there is the other aspect, which I think will be trouble for us. Like the system, even guess is what people are gonna to say, and translates sooner. And sometimes you can because you know the . So where is he asked for other word words. Sometimes You can guess to 90 percent. Yet should you do that? Because you may have maybe wrong.",
            "Yeah. So this is . We are trying to run GPT tool to predict the tail of the sentence.",
            "Ah, okay.",
            "Yeah, yeah. But it so far. It's like, the ASR so bad that that the prediction is like totally off, and so far it doesn't work at all, but but we are trying this guessing. So maybe I think it totally makes sense to do this guesses. That's what the interpreters do. And that's a question whether we will be able to do it well enough and half a good enough confidence eh explicitely in the models to make the decision, whether we should follow this guess or not.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay. So back back to the demo.",
            "Back to finish.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the demo. The date should be . Where was that idealy May? 14th May 17th the sooner the better. And there eh is there is all this uh, all these recommendations for all the partners and their systems. But I think we should . There is no way to touch up on these topics before the demo. So my question back to PERSON13. Would could you, could ORGANIZATION5 supervise the the organization of the of the demo? Obviously, asking all the partners to have their systems ready. And and all that, but like doing the communication, so that that eh successfully. That that we delivered demo.",
            "Yeah. So we can. It's important is 17 than 4.",
            "Say it again, it's a .",
            "I mean it's important it's not a. Because it's too",
            "Very soon.",
            "Too close to, yeah.",
            "Yeah, so they said, they said sooner is better. So maybe maybe the best option send, so did closer to sending. So could it be like the 8th the so 11th seems like the average.",
            "We learn about quit couple of proposal in the.",
            "Maybe, maybe, so actually it won't be better if you could even create the Doodle Poll with time slots already for PERSON5. And directly con PERSON5. So like these are the time slots, which we are like offering. And then uh, well for all the partners it should be . Yeah.",
            "I think it's better if we post the final this proposal informaly as a Doodle and then ask PERSON5.",
            "Yeah. Okay.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So we will, we will learn set up the Doodle, send it to in both partners. Then then once agree share with.",
            "Yeah. And also propose what you prefer to demo because there is . You send, you have seen the email. I've sent a couple of a like a recorded demo most to PERSON5 and propose, and something specific. It's up to us. So well, decide.",
            "Well, uh, PERSON8?",
            "Uhm.",
            "I saw the demo you send project officer and she mostly seen the Monday seminary, em.",
            "Ehm. You mean the Czech talk, right?",
            "Eh, yes.",
            "Yeah, Okay.",
            "I, think that probably we if you would like to present to the same thing we should then everything right now put the same set up without the. It's also well tested by you. So it will be probably the safe solution. Might just, my only worry is about how to presents the results to the project officier. Because actually during the demo you project both the ORGANIZATION2 representation and the sub ORGANIZATION5 subtitles. In the future of the page on the projector in the class. And we will not vote to presente the same thing online to the project officer. Because actually are two different web pages, it's completly different.",
            "Yeah. So what we can do is like screen sharing and screen a broadcasting.",
            "Ah, okay. It works.",
            "That is that is an option. And and a question is, what should be the material that we are that we are subtitling.",
            "Eeh, Well, eh.",
            "I think it could be some low like French watching session.",
            "Yes to the ASR domains.",
            "That was quite challenging.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "I'm not worrying about this, they have the same process on subtitling. And not really doing subtitling at the moment, we are doing transcription and translation, which is not subtitling by some kind of summarization. Sometimes. Which we won't do. It just about managing expectations.",
            "Yeah, yeah. That's true. So the translation, transcription and translation. And in that case, that's the paragraph you, which we can include in the demo as well. So I think the demo should demo both.",
            "Hm. I think the idea screenshare is a good one. Just takes away one indicate .",
            "Yes.",
            "Completely your own. Yeah, yeah.",
            "But the the live aspect there. So what the, yeah, what was the challenge on the French watching session that we didn't understand the source language.",
            "Yeah, we didn't, to be honest, someone PERSON4 understood. What what the topic was. And you didn't really understand, and I didn't. You talk about the item, didn't. Understand so well, I have trouble with with it as well. So it was quite hard to follow have to met.",
            "Yeah. So that's that's a safer way of selling what we are doing. I've already, yeah .",
            "Some like a TED talk suppose might be . Little bit to save, is it?",
            "No, no, It's not necessary to save. So it could be authentic stock, or something like that, so that it's not delivered in English, the prime language. So maybe if the primer language would be German, because ORGANIZATION7 has good models for this. And from German into English and from English into all the languages, TEDx talk.",
            "Is the audio gonna be easier and gonna be clearer than news broadcast is gonna be easier for ASR.",
            "I think that the segmentation would be a little bit easier. But, Well, I don't know. Sentence segmentation. So what so far in our experiments what kills the performance for the final user of the machine translation is the sentence segmentation.",
            "Ehm.",
            "we have new models now as well.",
            "Is it just cause sent me I mean because fundamentally sentiments segmentation is really hard, because people just you're trying compose compose something that is not really there cause I'm not speaking in sentences.",
            "I think that many of the . There are many errors. So yes, there is this hard concept. But still, there there are many cases where I would simply nowhere to put the full stop. And the system does not put it there.",
            "Okay. So it is about partly by having better models.",
            "Yeah. So maybe maybe PERSON15 he could propose some German talks that are uh, on this and we we should test the whole set up via English into all the languages.",
            "Yes, umm. I can do that in next week, I can't that this week.",
            "Say it again. It will be when?",
            "It will be next week.",
            "Yes, yeah. So uh. So the communication about the the day should be already like that to start internally immediately. Then early next week, we should sent an email to the PERSON5 to truce, his date. And that would be towards the end of the the next week, we should be ready for that. And in the week from the 11th, the sooner the better. We should run it life for them. And before that we should run it for ourselves, right?",
            "mmhmm. Umhum. Okay.",
            "Yeah, Okay so. Sorry for not managing the the half an hour.  Thanks for joining, and will be in very close touch for for the demo in the coming days.",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Thank you.",
            "Bye. Bye."

            "Unfortunately, there is no overlap between eh ORGANIZATION6 and ORGANIZATION2 eh in this week, so I'll try to do the poll for the next week as well eh and hopefully, we will find something eh there.",
            "If no, then we'll, I'll just transfer whatever is whatever is needed.",
            "Umm, yeah.",
            "Okay, so eh for today, we have this eh small call and the news is, eh, are there any news from ORGANIZATION4 about the status?",
            "Because you have the official contact points and eh I'm not sure whether you have received any response from them whatsoever.",
            "I am not sure either but I hope, that there will be a resistent answer soon. I was tasked to prepare the exact questions we are asking so I hope that's on track, but PERSON1",
            "Yeah, so that it's already like two weeks since you have contacted them, at least.",
            "So hopefully they will be able to respond in some reasonable time.",
            "Eh, the second question is",
            "This is the our internal ORGANIZATION4 decision, and I know, that you are like not the \"this is a very decisive person\", but still, do you think do sense, that within ORGANIZATION4, the idea is, that you don't want to get any money from this project, eh?",
            "Is that correct?",
            "Yes, that's actually correct, we don't want any money.",
            "I, that that could be considered official already, mm.",
            "Yeah, okay, so we will we will proceed and will modify the budget without you.",
            "But at the same time we will allocate person months to you.",
            "Or like you should allocate those in the ORGANIZATION8 and I will somehow make it clear in the tables, that the person months that are by ORGANIZATION4 will not be paid for from the budget, but you will be assumed to have your own funding for those person months.",
            "Ehm, so I don't know, how this is going to be checked by the commission afterwards, but just promise some sensible number of person months, that you could indeed claim, that you have worked on project, and definitely, it should tasks you want to do within the scope eh, of the project, so just like broadcasters further within ORGANIZATION4.",
            "Thank you.",
            "So then the, eh the speech to speech translation is something that eh ORGANIZATION6 doesn't want to have in the eh, like they don't want to ship translated audio to the partners parties in the, eh remote conference calls.",
            "I don't think that this is a big problem.",
            "I think that we'll just make sure that in the project, there is no promise on this, and eh eh with ORGANIZATION2, this makes the situation easier, because you would only eh make sure that the platform produces subtitles and sends them to to ORGANIZATION6.",
            "For the real use case, like not remote, eh but but eh, the physical world use case, eh we are still probably undecided how are we going to ship the translations to the participants, but my baseline eh idea is some web page that gets updated, so that would be again speech to text translation, and eh eh, I don't know em, PERSON1, whether you have experience with shipping voice to individual cell phones or, how should we approach this for the for the conference or the workshops at eh at ORGANIZATION4 events.",
            "No, we don't have experience.",
            "We always provided subtitles, basically.",
            "Yes.",
            "We have to identify eh, in fact, how the the final platform for the delivery of the of the translation, I think, but the ehmm, text to speech doesn't add so much information to the text, in fact, and probably",
            "That actually",
            "Please.",
            "Yeah, eh, I just wanted to confirm that I also think that it actually makes the information harder to digest eh.",
            "Yes, because it's ehh it doesn't provide any prozaic information, so that's the",
            "The text to speech doesn't provide any information more than that.",
            "Yeah, okay, yeah, thank you.",
            "So, we will board in the project as you specified or you, within the integration work package should, like make sure the description is clear, and ORGANIZATION4 should be aware of this, like for their workshops.",
            "That ORGANIZATION4 should somehow make sure that participants have some devices at hand, that can display the subtitles in in some form.",
            "Because each of the the idea is, that each of the participants will be seeing the translations in his own language.",
            "Eh, so the eh ORGANIZATION2 eh eh integration should eh translate from the single speech signal that comes in to a into the many target languages, and ship those subtitles to the different eh users at eh the workshop.",
            "Yes, that's correct.",
            "Just a question, because maybe it was not clear to me.",
            "Eh the ehmm application to provide the subtitle would be ORGANIZATION6 application, correct?",
            "That's for the remote meetings, but I don't think that this is the case for the live meetings eh the ORGANIZATION4 the ORGANIZATION9 congress, so there is the plenary session of the ORGANIZATION9 congress and then, there is the individual meetings, like the workshops.",
            "And eh, in the plenary session, there is the single speech given by the speaker, and then possibly some some questions, and we'll try to connect to the interpretors eh and eh and eh transcribe their voices, and or directly the main one eh and then eh, this will be shipping the subtitles to somewhere.",
            "Eh, and this somewhere, eh in a very baseline solution, can be just the web page with, like autorefresh eh and Unknown_voice",
            "And, yea.",
            "Sorry, it wasn't clear to me, so I will also asking the integration work package for the let me say presentation application development.",
            "Yes, yes for live meetings? Yes, yes.",
            "So, the idea is that that you, in this project, you are the integrator for all the technologies, and you are also the final eh application provider for their live use case.",
            "Because ORGANIZATION6 will not be involved in the the live meetings eh.",
            "And I think, that the ORGANIZATION6 should be in, like present at the at the conference at the the ORGANIZATION9 congress for dissemination purposes, because there will be also the eh meetings eh done remotely among the ORGANIZATION4 delivery SAI institute.",
            "And for the remote meetings, they will use the ORGANIZATION6 platform, and then the subtitles are delivered through ORGANIZATION2 into the ORGANIZATION6 platform. Okay, that's that's fine.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "So this was this was this was also for PERSON2, just to make to make that eh, to like, known in within ORGANIZATION4 that ehm.",
            "And maybe, ORGANIZATION4 should contribute to that integration task some personmonth on like, agreeing on the interface.",
            "You mean for the ORGANIZATION9 congress?",
            "Yes, and for the workshop, for the live events.",
            "Yeah, that's, for me, it's a part of the congress.",
            "Yea, of course, this has to be.",
            "Hm, hm, hm.",
            "Yea, so simply, PERSON1 will create a task in the work package 7 in the integration, and this task should have some like many more person month by ORGANIZATION2, because they need to develop this.",
            "But also, there should be some small amounts of person month by ORGANIZATION4 to, like make sure that ORGANIZATION4 is aware of what the platform needs and and how to, like make sure that the participants can use it. Unknown_speaker",
            "Yes, okay.",
            "Yea.",
            "Okay.",
            "Thank you, so now let's move to the next eh, item in the agenda, and there's the task and the task and deliverables related to the ORGANIZATION9 congress, and other ORGANIZATION4 events, and this is something, that would like to just clarify how I see it, and make sure that you you see it similarly.",
            "Eh, so there will be the main ORGANIZATION9 congress eh, in the middle of the project, and then, before that, there could be some dry runs workshops, or there will be some, we will make sure that there are some.",
            "And after that, there will be also other events again, this workshop style eh events mainly.",
            "So when I say workshop style, I mean",
            "I hope that everybody sees it the same way?",
            "So, ORGANIZATION4 should make sure that there is that there is enough events happening and that we know about them, and that we like, connect to them.",
            "Aside of the main ORGANIZATION9 congress.",
            "And ORGANIZATION2 should be ready to.",
            "Well, I don't know, maybe maybe maybe you should have like.",
            "You definitely have person month and travel eh plans eh in the budget for the main congress, but maybe you should add some extra for the other events.",
            "The dry run and also the followup ones.",
            "Yes the we have the nonapriori the number of events, that would be eh manageable.",
            "I think but at least one event per project a year should be very important.",
            "Also, for the view for the",
            "Yeah.",
            "Review meetings.",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "So, I think, that in the first year, we should have at least one dryrun workshop, eh which is like actually a complete test, but it's still before the main ORGANIZATION9 congress.",
            "In the second year, there definitely should be the main congress, and then eh maybe one more in the same second year, or eh like two in the third year.",
            "So I would eh ask eh ORGANIZATION4, if it seems reasonable to have one dryrun, one main congress and then two follow up workshops.",
            "Could you check, if this is eh if this is feasible, or if we have to go for just one dry run main conference and then one followup?",
            "Well, it is, I believe it s not decided yet eh.",
            "We have only a vague idea that, of course, something will be happening the year after the congress, but what and how many is not decided yet.",
            "But also, you reminded me an important thing",
            "Because there is the clear distinction now between your plenary and the workshops.",
            "And from yo your your speech, I get the idea, that you are interested mainly in the workshoptype thing.",
            "Yes, that's because it's eh like ehh it's more in line with the speech research partners want to focus on, that's nonnative speech.",
            "And, it like reduces the the further burden of the source languages, so eh it's maybe the more important setting.",
            "The congress with the plenary sessions is something too to show off, but the eh the workshops are eh, like more practical, I would say.",
            "So, that's the that's why I kind of promote them now.",
            "A bit more.",
            "Yes, it makes sense, but I need to ask.",
            "I have no idea what forum the other events will be in.",
            "Yeah, I've understood that from what I've heard from your colleagues, I've understood, that it's mainly these workshopstyle sessions that the congress is with plenary sessions is is something eh, not that frequent.",
            "So, I think that ehh, PERSON1, for now, I think, we're quite on the safe side to say that will have one dry run, one main and then two followup experiments.",
            "So if you can plan four events in total, one of them being the the longer one, that that will probably be easy to to accomplish.",
            "I was about to answer the anchor point you put into the ORGANIZATION7 doc.",
            "I wouldn't create I wouldn't like not to create separate task, but to have a one single task ORGANIZATION4 events.",
            "Okay.",
            "and) one believable prior.",
            "Okay, eh, yea.",
            "So, eh so the then this task should be planned for the all the three years, like ehh, maybe starting at month 7, because nothing could happen earlier, but running until the end without any specific dates, right?",
            "Exactly.",
            "Okay, so let's make this one task for ORGANIZATION4 events, and then, in the task description, we will say, that we plan to have the dry run and then the main and then the two follow ups.",
            "Yeah, so that's clear.",
            "Exactly.",
            "Yeah, okay thank you.",
            "And then, related thing is the eh the view, like where the events should be mentioned, and I've put it into that into the agenda here.",
            "So the the integration work package eh is the one that makes sure that everything runs.",
            "That actually delivers the software and the tool to that to those events.",
            "While the work package 7 dissemination helps to promote the project and its results at these events.",
            "So this is like, collocated activity and the dissemination is something, ehh that ehh should include eh ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Whereas the eh integration for the events does not need ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Because the ORGANIZATION6 is not providing eh anything any remote platform eh into these events.",
            "Is that clear?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yea, okay.",
            "Yeah, so now let's move on to the next item, which is the the OTHER2.",
            "So I understand that the ORGANIZATION2 would like OTHER2.",
            "Yes.",
            "I'm not sure how the word extend is like covered in OTHER2.",
            "Well, we don't have ORGANIZATION5 on the call.",
            "But they already have some OTHER2.",
            "Eh, so, eh I don't know, how much personmonths do we have to devote to OTHER2 to, to move it to level where eh where ORGANIZATION2 would like it.",
            "And at the same time, we need to justify eh this additional resources for OTHER2.",
            "From like the overall project's use case.",
            "Eh, so maybe, PERSON1 if you could say more about like what the level of OTHER2, how much effort is needed there, or eh and then ORGANIZATION4 will comment on on eh eh, like, the availability of the need of of that, or maybe, we can squeeze some of this need from ORGANIZATION6, possibly.",
            "I'm just guessing.",
            "So if yea.",
            "Okay, just let me add one thing to this.",
            "And also ORGANIZATION2 is active in the ASR field and provide ASR for not only for OTHER2 language but but for thirty language, currently.",
            "So OTHER2",
            "So OTHER2, obviously, being our mother tongue language, is that the one where we perform better.",
            "And we already specialize the OTHER2 ASR the for many many eh, domains, so called domains.",
            "Currently one of our customer is the constitutional court and depending on the availability of the data, the personmonths required the for training and dedicated the OTHER2 model, for the OTHER2 ASR model eh let me say, can vary from eh three to six month person months for maximum.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So, it's not a huge task and we can we have perform the eh tests also on the on a at the OTHER2 parliament.",
            "We have been competing for the OTHER2 parliament, and we reach the accuracy up to ninety eight percent of accuracy.",
            "That, emm.",
            "Yeah.",
            "It is considered the most accurate OTHER2 speech recognition system, so it's",
            "Okay, yeah.",
            "That's, that's very good and I think, that the that needs to be like advertised for in the project proposal as well, and that extends your role from being just the integrator to also working directly on the ASR work package, right?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yeah, so please make sure that your person months are already are also included in ASR work package and in the description, the ASR work package is not yet populated very much.",
            "So ORGANIZATION5 role is even a little slower than we are with the writing.",
            "So this like very good, you can easily propose your own person months there in the work packages and then they will see that you want to be a body or in touch with them anyway, probably.",
            "So a just let's let's make that clear in the proposal, and OTHER2 is not one of the big languages of ORGANIZATION4, but it's still one of the official languages, so it it's totally acceptable to to have that in.",
            "And since we have the OTHER2 partner and the best eh ASR system for OTHER2 in, it's, it would be a pity not to use it i would say.",
            "Eh, okay eh thank you.",
            "So we probably do not need any specific need from from ORGANIZATION4 on this, but still, maybe ask around and or mention, that in the project, there is this partner, who has the best OTHER2 recognition in the world, so that there is the chance to to use it.",
            "PERSON2, right?",
            "Ehm I guess i can ask around, but I'll probably get the official reply reply again that it would be unfair to prioritize any non primary language over the other.",
            "But what to do is probably for you to decide to talk about it in this way anyway.",
            "Yeah, yeah, okay.",
            "So eh, yea, I see.",
            "So ORGANIZATION4, yeah.",
            "So simplified well.",
            "Eh, okay.",
            "So now the the the next item is the this table on the respeaker data.",
            "So if we can open that, that's part of the eh, budget, that's the third sheet on the budget.",
            "And this is something where we need to eh like eh.",
            "This is for us, this is for our ORGANIZATION4, and estimate, how many person months should we allocate eh in the data collection work package eh and ehh ehh, this is already eh doing eh detailed accounting on how many hours per speaker do we need ehhh for ehh to be able to adapt to to the speaker.",
            "And in which languages do we plan this eh and so on.",
            "So eh, and also eh.",
            "So, one purpose is to adapt to the speaker and second purpose is to have this person as the respeaker at one of the live events.",
            "So eh as you see on online 17 and below, eh there is what i entered for for our ORGANIZATION4's but this is a very raw guess, and i don't know, PERSON4 is is here, but maybe ORGANIZATION2 also knows.",
            "How many hours per speaker do we need to be able to adapt to them?",
            "So my understanding is that for each respeaker or interpreter that we want to reliably recognise, we will ask them to sit a certain number of hours and read aloud some written text.",
            "And record this.",
            "Is that the way this is done?",
            "Or is it done differently, the speaker adaptation? Speaker adaptation is done essentially how you described, usually. 23",
            "That's a lot of work. Yes, yes.",
            "I know it's I know it's I know it's a lot of work, so I don't know how much should we say that we need per speaker. Ehmm, let me say whether usually, we collect eh fewer data in order to eh maximise both the ehh effort needed and the result. But we really ask, let me say a maximum of a one hour. But I'll repeat, it depends on the ASR engine. And also obviously eh the more the data the most effect that the adaptation has. So it's eh always eh.",
            "And then, for OTHER4, eh we, as ORGANIZATION3 would have like to get hold of two of them and each of them eh this this respeakers could be, may be asked to do more, maybe up to five hours per per respeaker.",
            "And then, for the presence eh of these respeakers, at the conference, that actually needs to estimate the full duration of the event.",
            "So three full days of dry run, and five for main conference.",
            "Now i heard, that the main conferences is four days, right?",
            "PERSON2, is the main conference four days?",
            "From the top of my head i don't know.",
            "I think it's i think it's four days .",
            "So this is here is a formula that eh it doesn't really work eh.",
            "Here's a formula that I'll edit it, can I edit it?",
            "That estimates eh at now like seventy hours that need to be covered and this is obviously no longer like uninterrupted speech.",
            "So this eh hours per speaker should be also like the eh total hours, so we need the speaker for.",
            "So if there is like some training phase or whatever, that should be included in this, so that's why when PERSON1 said that you ask the person to speak for one hour, it's it would be probably good to put here like two hours and if I say four, then I actually expect than I don't get more than three hours of the recording or something like that.",
            "Eh, so, I would like now ehh everyone.",
            "You just to",
            "Because I was being eh about the numbers.",
            "The adaptation starts from an already existing acoustic model for the language.",
            "So all of the",
            "Yes.",
            "Okay.",
            "So it's mandatory",
            "To have a a a OTHER1 and the OTHER4 an acoustic model to ehmmm start with the adaptation.",
            "Yeah, yea.",
            "So, i assume that the the adaptation model for, ehh, so, well, actually, when the when the recording happens, eh, you need just the person and a proper device to record the voice.",
            "But, then to actually make use of these data, you do have to have the model.",
            "Yes.",
            "And I have, I assume, that for OTHER4.",
            "I have lost you on",
            "Eh believing, okay?",
            "Or what did you say?",
            "I have lost the your sentence, I have lost eh.",
            "Yeah, yea.",
            "So, i was just saying, that for the recording, you have only the person and the device, and then, for the usage of this recording for the actual model adaptation, you need to have the the baseline acoustic model and I assume, that for OTHER4, this will be given to to or provided eh to the project by ORGANIZATION5 or ORGANIZATION1, or possibly even ORGANIZATION2. We we will try to create our own, but we are still starting with this, so i don't expect that we'll be able to to have eh like the best perform models ourselves.",
            "And for OTHER1, of eh I'm in touch with the OTHER1 radio and they should be able to provide us with eh like a considerable number of hours em.",
            "I'm like getting the numbers right now and put them into proposal a to create the baseline acoustic model.",
            "So, there will be more personmonths necessary to process this, eh and like clean and train the acoustic model on that, but we should not need any recordings for the baseline acoustic model for OTHER1.",
            "Hopefully, the data is already out there somewhere.",
            "Okay and eeh most important for the also for the adaptation, is to also have the transcription of these which",
            "Yes, yes so, that's what the OTHER1 radio also has, an there has there was a a a project here, that also did this transcribing of of eh OTHER1 recordings, so there is some transcribe data for OTHER1.",
            "My eh, my final suggest in regarding the adaptation is to be able to collect real eh respeaking sessions in order to also be able to model not only the voice, but also the way it is.",
            "The speech during a real life session.",
            "Because you know, reading ehmm without the pressure of the event is different than on the event.",
            "Yeah, i see.",
            "Yeah, so let's that that's a very good idea eh i will make sure that we have this like, it it actually fits nicely in the eh in the hours here in this table, so we could have like one more purpose and that would be, eh like recording or adapting eh at at re respoken events, so that could be part of this these conferences already.",
            "Or it could be a separate thing.",
            "I think this is, that in the proposal, that we should write that this will happen at the dryrun, but we may want to have like more such respeaking sessions eh as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah  thank you.",
            "So for OTHER2 and for the other languages",
            "So then, each of you once like, you have indicated, that on that type of language and the type of a speaker, we'll see how many person months it creates and this number should be accounted for in the in the data work package. ()Okay.",
            "So we we can obviously process also OTHER4 speaking a respeakers like giving short term contracts to them and to and do the recording here in LOCATION1 eh, so if if eh, for example eh, ORGANIZATION1 would suggest, that they want to have some OTHER4 respeakers like at hand, then just make sure that you, like create this line here and say that it is to be included in our budget, because, like we should be paying those people, but it is for the purposes that ORGANIZATION1 wants to do something specific.",
            "If that would be the case.",
            "Eh, but this has to be filled by each partner.",
            "All the teams, who. add the needs for OTHER3.",
            "Yes, so all that, this should be filled by all the teams, that want to get, like direct access to data for speaker adaptation, and I would leave this to up to the ORGANIZATION5 to decide, how much time do they want to invest into speaker adaptation for OTHER3.",
            "The the project eh will so, so, eh yeah, it's it's it's like, very uncertain at the moment, but we hope to get hold of eh of the actual interpreters, who will be interpreting at the sa ORGANIZATION9 congress, and it would be great get these for the adaptations sessions.",
            "And these would be speaking OTHER3, French, a a as well eh, so eh, maybe our create here like all these, for for each of these languages some ORGANIZATION3handled respeakers and hope that we will get these people and record those.",
            "But if ORGANIZATION5 or your would like to have more data for your particle language of interest, then enter this here eh.",
            "Well, as i said this is only for us to see how much how many person months do we have to have in in work package 1 on the data.",
            "And this is, this is what we'll add there.",
            "So, eh then, these person month here do not make it directly to the eh to the spreadsheet here, to the efforts.",
            "They should get to hear only through the Overleaf involvement in the data collection task.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yea, Yea.",
            "So, is there there's one more thing, and that would be the other direct eh the other direct costs.",
            "So for the equipment",
            "You are just fine with the audio equipment that was there.",
            "Ehm let me say, that i've started checking the availability of specific hardware, eh, especially for the respeakers.",
            "Because, you know, if we have respeakers, they have to be, they have to use a specific headset in order to be sure.",
            "But the audio signal is the the better for eh for us.",
            "Okay.",
            "Some for, for the equipment eh, I think, that we will also need some of those devices for the respeaker adaptation.",
            "Okay, okay.",
            "So if you can make like a separate line for one ORGANIZATION5, of for for recording and I'll copy that for ourselves then.",
            "Okay.",
            "Yeah, okay eh, thank you.",
            "So this should, we will have a next call a without ORGANIZATION2 but with others on Thursday, so if you could do this before Thursday with some rough numbers, that would probably be good, well the time is running up.",
            "It's we have like fourteen days to finish eh the proposal and that's that's very little.",
            "Okay, so the last bit is the missing text parts, and eh here, i think that it's probably more efficient, if we just say goodbye and everybody will spend the remaining fifteen minutes in writing and writing and writing.",
            "Or do you have any other ideas how to make sure that we  create a good proposal?",
            "Is there anything remain to discuss?",
            "I think it's eh important, also for the integration part, the other parties needs to integrate because all of the parties will need to integrate, also participate in the drafting the text. Putting, just putting ideas i can elaborate on an ideas to improve the integration. But so from my side.",
            "Yeah, so there's one thing actually that I want to wanted to comment on.",
            "Thanks, already, you created the tasks in the integration work package, but primal titles only, and it was not clear to me what is the integration with publishing platform, so the publishing platform is for the minutes, that's like the, eh, or wha wha that's task 6.4.",
            "Emm I'll try to open that here, if I",
            "Task 6.4 eh was the one what was not so clear to me and yo we already thought about that before and if",
            "I see. The the imple, the development of the plot of the publishing platform of the",
            "Ah, yea, I see, okay. For live meeting yet.",
            "Yeah, so as of now, the tasks I I I like it's hard for me to locate it, but the task integration still, I should, maybe not here, where's the Overleaf, Overleaf, Overleaf, yeah.",
            "So, task 6.1 is the integration of ASR essential from multiple partners into the ORGANIZATION2's platform, and eh that's, so everybody is involved in there, which is expect to be expected.",
            "The integration of multi target empty engine should definitely include us and ORGANIZATION1, i guess.",
            "Yes.",
            "So, PERSON4, make sure that you are there as well.",
            "I'm talking about this, if you can see my screen then I'm talking about task 6.2.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then, we have this automatic minuting, there will be more involvement eh from us and eh from al from ORGANIZATION6.",
            "Ehm, I'm not sure about so this is record regarding the other email, the the work package leadership.",
            "I don't know how much you want to eh delve into minuting yourself or how much causes you want to delve into minuting.",
            "Eh, so depending on that",
            "We can discuss on properly on the other",
            "Yeah, exactly.",
            "Yeah, yeah, exactly.",
            "Or maybe exclusively ORGANIZATION2, right?",
            "Yeah, maybe I will eh, I would like to also add that ORGANIZATION4 of all of the design and testing purposes because that would be something",
            "Yeah, good one, exactly, yeah, so ORGANIZATION4 ORGANIZATION4 and ORGANIZATION2 should be here.",
            "At the ORGANIZATION9 congress, this is actually something, which was fairly named today, but it should be at all the ORGANIZATION4 events and these should include eh everyone eh, because everyone will be a eh, like eh at eh like everyone should be available for the ORGANIZATION9 congress, and also for the other for the other events.",
            "So, that, the involvements in terms of first months will vary, but eh everybody should eh eh be there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So, the deliverables.",
            "I think that will probably promise reports only.",
            "Or systems?",
            "I don't know, yeah, maybe, maybe PERSON4 could comment on there design of deliverables, because that's what like in the spoken language translation, and maybe we could mimic this layout in, in in the integration work package 2.",
            "Yeah, so what can I say here.",
            "Em, in project, we had similar we had similar division that we had to prototype to the actual systems.",
            "That we eh packed into the deliverables and we had some reports that we wrote. PERSON4",
            "Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure like eh whether all the prototypes should be deliverables, we just promised to deliver systems that be ready for em starting the integration thing, that was mentioned some months, six was mentioned somewhere, eh, but maybe that shouldn't be a deliverable for the prototypes, so I don't know all and other work.",
            "That's a milestone.",
            "That's a milestone.",
            "A milestone, okay.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So milestones are, I've heard that milestones are something, that you just tick off in the system where's for each deliverable, even if it's software, there has to be like a cover letter, cover report, is that true?",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think it is, yea.",
            "So deliverable is a typical pdf, and copied",
            "Yea, exactly.",
            "Well, we did a few prototypes.",
            "In fact, those were small reports, to be said well, this is a prototype, just how you install it, this is the number of languages covered here's what it stands for, ehm.",
            "Promo.",
            "The prototype, like eh I prepared a few amateurs and stuff like that.",
            "So it ended up being report.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Let's eh, so I suggest, that to do the same thing.",
            "Is the question, the hard question is the timing.",
            "Eh, so, eh, maybe, PERSON1, if you eh could suggest something for a for your for your work package?",
            "Like by when should be what version available, and then we will check it.",
            "In the timing of the deliverables should be somewhat in line with the timing of the work packages.",
            "And this the work package that we have just talked about is eh spoken OTHER4 translation and that's that's 3, work package 3, so recourse tasks all run throughout the whole project.",
            "So the organisation is then, kind of eh taken over by the individual prototypes and the releases.",
            "I would slightly prefer to have some, like progress visible also in the tasks, and that's what I do for my multilingual mission translation.",
            "Eh, so this is like the current tentative plan that will first focus on multitarget and then multisource and then flexible multisource and whatever.",
            "And there g will be deliverables related to those, and I like the idea of having a few months between the software and the report and the integration, so eh, for the ASR, eh, sorry, for the integration work package, work package number 6, there is also this like compact block of eh, of tasks.",
            "All tasks running through all the project duration.",
            ";And I would like to see this somehow eh, somehow graded.",
            "Eh, so the for for example the minuting integration is definitely something that can start only like in the middle of the project.",
            "So I'll  Is it okay if I write it in a doc, a word document?",
            "Yes, yes.",
            "It's much faster for me to wor.",
            "Yes, totally okay.",
            "Totally okay, I prefer ORGANIZATION7 doc, if you don't mind, so, well I don't have Microsoft Word at all, so if you send me a Word doc, I will upload it to ORGANIZATION7 doc anyway to just open it, actually, eh.",
            "Okay.",
            "So, if you start a ORGANIZATION7 doc, separate one then I'll, I'm happy to do the merging of the text into the Overleaf.",
            "Okay, that's fine.",
            "ORGANIZATION7 doc is fine for me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Okay, so I think that's that's it for now, let's indeed eh close the call, unless there's any other questions?",
            "No more questions from my side.",
            "Yeah, okay.",
            "So thanks very much everybody for joining today and eh, PERSON4, we'll talk again on Thursday, and otherwise we keep exchanging emails and, hopefully, the text will like get created quickly, yeah.",
            "Thanks.",
            "Thanks.",
            "Bye.",
            "Yeah, thank you, bye bye.",

            "Or in that same sense in, in that you have everything there even before?",
            "No, no, no. I, now I, I, I get, got rid off the, like the to do sections at the end of the section so I can figure it all the papers that I want to refer to somewhere. But maybe I would like to, um, write different stuff about them but well... Yeah.",
            "But you still have like the many to does.",
            "No.",
            "No?",
            "Well, I have some to does but, but not the big to does. So yeah, um, I'm OK that's right.",

            "So introduction is to do.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. So it's kind of, yeah, not plannig to add new content, just write this nicely.",
            "The problem is that we haven't that defined what does it mean to add new content.",
            "Like kind of the information is already there more or less so...",
            "new contents.  Yeah, it depens on the definition. That's right.  Yeah, the multilinguality is not there. Um, yeah, cause I don't know much about it actually but I think we maybe say we can just",
            "We have the paper about that.",
            "So... So I guess the paper that cited there the PERSON5 for the multilinguality this is what we'll kind of appear there and yeah.  That's just the last one.",

            "Oh. The next phase should have been commenting on, on others text. It doesn't mean to comment on text that is not finished at all.",
            "Um, um, so the content is there. So the text is not final. It's kind of, yeah. So I'm not planning to add new content. I'm just planning to rewrite what's already there, um..",
            "So you didn't understand what, what it is content.  Yeah, because Yeah, in the next week we should, we should",
            "Like if you have",
            "Have it and comment everything so...",
            "Yeah. Like I don't know if you have a box of chocolate and you just plan to arrange the chocolate nicely so you're not adding new content, you're just rearranging what's already in the box. So that's my take of content.",

            "Yeah.",
            "Um, do you plan to add, um, some pictures there?",
            "Yeah, I don't know. I talked about it repeatedly that I'm not good at pictures. I tried adding one picture and that's about the way I can add pictures so just, um... Extract them from some paper and, and put them there.",
            "Yeah, this is fai.",
            "Yeah.",

            "So I don't know how, how many such paper we sh, we, um, how many s, um, these copied so pictures are there.",

            "Yeah.",
            "So this is just a png extracted from the paper. So I opened the paper in Inkscape and I degroup it and I saved just the image into the file and png. And I put it here. So that's like the best I can do I guess.",

            "Hm.",
            "Into our book?",
            "I don't know. Maybe we should at least check the licence of the paper.",

            "Something",

            "Yes.",
            "And... Yeah, I actually don't know like to rules like, I think it depends on the licence of each of the papers. So I think it",
            "That you cannot do it, hm   If it's not PERSON24 then I don't know. If it's some",
            "You can",
            "Created comments then you probably can do it.",
            "Um, if it's from ORGANIZATION1 antology it's, it's creative comments.",
            "OK. This is archive but archive lists the licence probably somewhere.",
            "Yeah. You need to specified the licence that's OK.",
            "Um, where do I find it?  Hm. PERSON23, hm, hm. Because I know that I need, needed to specify",
            "Yeah.",
            "The licence now but I don't know where it appers",
            "specify but",
            "Ah, licence. Here. Yeah, archive, non exclusive. Yeah.",
            "That this is bad.",
            "So, so it doesn't give me any",
            "No.",
            "Any rights. It's just for archive. So would need to find if it was published somewhere else. Hm.",
            "We could  Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "Let's open the pdf. Hm, hm, hm, hm. OK. Yeah, it doesn't same. Hm, this is it. OK. Proceedings of something on ORGANIZATION1 web. And... Yeah, it's, it's nakl so when is, when is nakl it should be OK you say.",
            "Yep.",
            "OK. And should we, I don't know, explain that somehow like that the licence allows that or I don't know what the nakl licence is like. If we have to include the licence or something like that.",
            "Hm. I think it's creative comments but... But I think it, it wouldn't hurt if we explicitly state it.",
            "Hm.",
            "Like even what page of the paper it is and, and, and under what lesson it is.",
            "Yeah, so I can easily cite the pa, page. This is what I learned recentely.  Yeah, it's just covereted comments by so I only have to atribute the source. Yeah. So I can say that is page 4. Or figure 2. What's better? Page or figure number?",
            "Figure number. What",
            "Figure number is better.",
            "What, what year was the article published?",
            "Hm...",
            "19.",
            "OK, so then it's creative comments atribution 4.0 international licence.",
            "Yeah. So that just we need to have to cite the source. And I don't know if you have to list the licence.",
            "Hm, it's",
            "Well",
            "It's an atribution and no additional restrictions so...",
            "But I would, I would still mention the licence.",
            "OK, the thing is one  How many such pictures you would like to have in our book? .",
            "Hm.",
            "So I think major, major all the pictures",
            "Hm.",
            "Should be ours.",
            "Yeah, I don't know.",
            "It is  It's",
            "Hm.",
            "It looks better.",
            "Hm, hm, hm.",
            "Um... Because in my, in my, in my chapter I like the matter the, all the, of the figures will be, will be ours. Or I can generate some of pictures from maybe I, I plan to generate the picture from, from tabels which are in the, in the, in the papers so, so it looks better. But I, I also plan the include one of two, one or two pictures from the, from the other papers. Not much, not many. Um, PERSON8, here's still, there are many subsections with no content.",
            "Um...",
            "These two?",
            "Yeah, that's kind of, I don't have more to say I think.  I can just",
            "You don't have any chocolate to, to this boxes.",
            "No. I, I can, I can just say them more detailed since just kind of, um, um, um, nougats. So they, they even no say much more in the original paper actually and I don't know any other papers, um, on that.",
            "And these? This is the same. Then these",
            "Maybe there are two more papers about name entities. I don't think there are more papers about grammatical error correction or event fractuality.",
            "But it, it's, it's strange to the",
            "You two, you two deffinitely say more about event fractuality.",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "Yeah, that's true.",
            "fractuality, yeah.",
            "OK, fair enough.",
            "You at least year.",
            "OK, that's, that is correct.  Yeah. So it shou, yeah, I think it will be like one paragraph or something. OK.",
            "Usually at the content at least.",
            "OK. OK.  I agree.",
            "It isn't easier to just put other like things?",
            "Hm.",
            "It's just.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I think",
            "I didn't really know",
            "That people",
            "How to",
            "like about the experiments.",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "In different tasks.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I didn't want to put through it just other but then it's true that I don't know where to prove it like these are syntax but, but the the other ones like gender of nouns",
            "Hm.",
            "Of I don't know semantics maybe but, um, I don't know. Um... Yeah, I tried to group them just on through things like syntax or semantics but, um, often I actually did not very sure, um. Like name entities. I don't know.",
            "Hm. Yeah. I, I have it much easier in the, in the attentions.",
            "Hm.",
            "Because I only need to group like some connections.",
            "Hm.",
            "So I group only the presency trees, constituency trees",
            "Hm. Hm.",
            "And, and, and coreferences.",
            "Hm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
            "So...",
            "So, so here  Yeah, in the, in the, in the hidden states or contextual embeddings people look for lot of stuff, um, yeah.",
            "Um, we still have the picture like the, like PERSON21. Where it is?",
            "Page 15 or 5?",
            "Um, it, it is  Yeah, I don't know why all, all my pictures are at the end of the chapter, there is some problem. Yeah.",
            "This is it.",
            "This one. That I think half of this  Half of this figure is like for attentions and the other half is like for, for probing, isn't it?",
            "No. No, everything here is for attentions.",
            "Everything is for attentions?",
            "Like it's hard but some parts are probing but in transformers. So yeah, it's like, it's like contextual embeddings.",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah, so, so yeah. This it's true.",
            "So maybe we should, we should devide this, this, um",
            "Hm. Into two pictures.",
            "Into two pictures.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Because this is, this is, um, GPT?",
            "Yeah, this is like GPT",
            "Hm.",
            "GPT and attentions. Um, there is also hidden one with PROJECT1",
            "Hm.",
            "So it would be also like probing.",
            "Ah, the hidden one we cannot see it now.",
            "Yeah, because",
            "Oh, yeah.",
            "It's on the right.",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
            "There is on the right. Yeah. I don't how chan, how to change this. This pgf but  Look so far I haven't look in, into it so...",
            "Hm, hm, hm, hm.",
            "Yeah, I, I think it can be some box that you can because to, to like put it some box",
            "Hm.",
            "Defined here.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Cause here, you can only put it's on.",
            "It's only included though.",
            "Yeah, they can like part, part it into",
            "Yeah and there, there are also one problems if these element of, of   pgf, I don't know, yeah.",
            "Hm. Well the problem is that, that, that lighting doesn't want to, um, do the words through, through Overlap.",
            "Do the, for, for",
            "So it  Um... Latex just, just for to prevents, the words from overlapping and then, then that's why it does those stuff.",
            "Aha, aha. OK. So if it is not nothing it will be OK. Se we need to regenerate",
            "Need to regenerate.",
            "We need to regenerate. We need to Yeah.",
            "Smaller font image.",
            "Smaller font. Yeah. And then transfer it. Yeah, so...",
            "I can do it.",
            "Yeah. Yeah. Actually on, only these two, two. Only your, your  Pictures are so fine pgf.",
            "Hm.",
            "The other some like pdf and I think so I, I need to, um... Yeah, this is, this is, this is like, this is google docs.  It needs to be, to be Yeah. To be done better. But OK. So in my, my chapter I, um, still don't have the first part finished. It needs to be rewritten. But the chocolate is already in the box but I need to  Rearrange the chocolates. But it's only the introduction and like the word element I think. And then it should be, it should be more or less written. So from 5.2... Maybe is Yeah, missing Um, maybe I would, I, I Some, in some parts I would, I could write more but... Yeah and there are some pictures missing.",
            "So if I want to read something I should start, um, what section? 5.2 and",
            "5.2.",
            "And go on.",
            "It's  Yeah. Because 5.1 you, you already read it and I haven't change it.",
            "OK.",
            "Um, so, so 5.2 and 5.3. Yeah, the, the pictures will be, will be changed within so the, they, they should be nicer but, um... 5.2, syntactic function, dependency trees, so yeah. This will written by PERSON21 and I, I have rewritten some, some parts so that it more fits the, the book. Um, it's consequency trees. And yeah, maybe we will, we will remove this table, I don't know.",
            "Hm.",
            "Um, um, yeah, and this is  This I Yeah. I have rewritten a bit the 5.3 but, um, is still, there is still missing the last, last part of this and some discussion o, on this part so there is still missing something and the end of this sub, subsection.",
            "Hm.",
            "And then  Yeah, today morning I wrote or today night I, I wrote this conclusion but yeah, I don't know. So this is more or less written but yeah, some parts still need to be rewritten and, and the pictures may, must be done better. OK. So, PERSON21?",
            "Hm, OK. Can I share my screen?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Or do I have the pdf of",
            "Switch it.",
            "Share my screen. entire screen. OK. Do you see my screen?",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes. OK. Do you see the book?",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK. Wait a minute. Hm, I don't Single page, hm. OK. So chapter 3, the first OK. The first part is written I guess and I'm sure that it would, um, like I'm sure that, um, it would benefit from further reading and comments and rewritting and so on. The to do section here can be safely deleted. It's just things that can be added but are not essential. Then there is this 3.1 methods for interpreting neural networks and I thought PERSON9 said he would write something.",
            "Yeah. Yeah, I said it but I haven't written.",
            "Hm. And yeah, then there's this 3.2 which I'm not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it but I think we can decide that at the end.",
            "I think this was, yeah, PERSON8's, PERSON8's, this was PERSON8's thing. So...",
            "This is what PERSON8 moved into my chapter and then I moved, moved it here.",
            "Yeah. I, I promised that I will, I will, I would, I will move fast of my introduction of my chapter to here as well because these, these are, these two texts are very, very similar.",
            "OK. Well, I'm not sure how",
            "So in, in our plan, um, it is... Um, where it is?",
            "Where is our plan? Here? This plan?",
            "No, the",
            "Yeah, yeah, this one. Yeah.",
            "Hm. PERSON9 Um, yeah, this is 3.1.",
            "Yeah.",
            "PERSON8 and me. Rewrite and move there something from, from chapter 5.",
            "OK and then there's this chapter which I need to move this. That's also in the to do list. 4.1, 4.2, move. And then... Yeah, I finally managed to train FastText embeddings. And as you can see the bands are actually there. Now what Now what's strange the FastText image here seems much more, um, similar to the original Glove image here. It's much more similar than the Glove that I trained. And Word2vec is still just noise so I'm not sure what make of this.",
            "Well, isn, isn't it just because of the colours? Of the colour scale?",
            "No. This is the same colour scheme.",
            "OK. Yeah, but I mean",
            "These  This, this is different.",
            "Yeah, but",
            "You can see the, the bands here and the bands here in the FastText's image are similar.",
            "But, but my point is that if you, if you would try to like shift the mean of the Glove colour scale you might end up with the same image as, as they, as they had. They just tried optimized through the, they might it, might it optimised virtual so it's more visible.",
            "So, so basic numbers should be normalized a bit.",
            "Well, I'm not sure what do you mean because",
            "Like they don't probably have the same, um, like the same mean, um, in the different models. So if you just divided them by the mean and all the images.",
            "Nothing happens, right.",
            "Nothing happens. Yeah.",
            "Hm.",
            "Because the, the scale is automatically adjusted to, to show the whole range.",
            "Hm.",
            "So...",
            "Yeah, but, but it. What I'm saying they, they, they might have use something lumenier just to, just to look it more visible.",
            "Aha.",
            "I was thinking about that. Well, I'll look into it.",
            "Hm.",
            "But it's strange that the FastText",
            "Yeah, yeah.",
            "Shows this structure right away.",
            "Yeah. My was different. I thought maybe some of the embeddings do have some extremes so if you include these extremess then most of it will be squashed. So if you, if you like cut of the top and bottom, 5 % maybe it could be different.",
            "Yeah, that's option.",
            "on scale but",
            "That's what maybe happening in this Glove image but why isn't the same thing happening here?",
            "Hm.",
            "Or why is it happening here?",
            "Hm.",
            "And... I don't know. It's strange.",
            "It's possible for Czech, not for English.",
            "Yes. Yes. But FastText shows the structure and the others don't. Strange thing. Anyway, images, images, images, bla, bla, bla. Yeah.  I've, um, written something about debiassing. I wrote a conclusion. So in the end the only things left for the to does is the, is  And then 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 which I'm confident I can do today so... Tonight the chocolates will be in the box.  And you can comment on them and then I rewrite the chocolates.  And the chapter will be done.",
            "Um, are you planning to do something about, about the figures?",
            "What?",
            "My figures or figures in general or PERSON21's figures?",
            "PERSON21's figures. For instants 4.1.",
            "Yeah, 4.1. I will either move it to your chapter or delete it.",
            "Um, right. And tell me what, um, how does it Because I think it's, this is the same as my figure, um... Where is it, um, where is it? Where is that? Um, 1.9.",
            "Yeah, well... Yeah. It's probably almost the same thing. I don't know. I... One thing is that your figure is quite ugly.",
            "At the other one would, would totally different fonts and",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then so it'll be beautiful.",
            "That's true. Also these figures are not completely the same because the original PERSON13 model had some, um, I'll How do I get back to the Here. Hm, hm, hm. It has these lines. What do you call them? Dashed lines?",
            "Yeah.",
            "They are some connections directly between embeddings and the soft max layer.",
            "Um...",
            "But yeah, also I think this is",
            "That's line only say that, um, that you can find the, um, the probability value for word at depositions it's... It doesn't mean any like computational connection.",
            "Hm.",
            "And because I thought it was confusing it's not in my figure.",
            "OK.  OK. So I think I will delete this figure. Also I think this is a bitmap image so it should be deleted anyway. Yeah. I will delete this figure and I may do something with your figure so...",
            "OK.",
            "Because like... What I don't like here is for example this arrow here.",
            "OK. Well, if I, if I make the, the subsign smaller it will, it will get fixed probably. Because in my disertation it wasn't like this.",
            "Yeah.",
            "With a different fonts.",
            "Also these arrows in general are ugly. But yeah. Other then that I don't need the figure when this figure is here so I delete it.",
            "my part write your text, um, like 4.2 or 4.3 and then you can, you can make this figure, um, better.",
            "Yeah. Sure.",
            "By the way this is the very first image I, I made in tix and the code is really terrible.  Don't, don't get scared when you, when you open the source.",
            "I've seen. I think I've seen worse. And... Also, yeah, hm... Hm. Hm. I think OK. I This is also ugly.",
            "You are ugly.",
            "Well, I'm but I'm not putting my face into the book.  Anyway, yeah, we can leave the ugly figures to the end.",
            "Please, first finish, finish the text.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And figures at least in, in some  Yeah, at these they should be there but they, they might ugly or we, we need to know what is there, what is in the figure.",
            "Yeah.",
            "No if the figure is ugly or not and then",
            "I, I guess",
            "You can make the figures, improve the figures.",
            "Yeah, I think we can improve the figures after it's been send to the reviewers right? If we don't change the content of the figures just how they look.",
            "Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah. It, it is possible to change it after. So if it, if we have it in pdf and not it pgf, it's no problem I think. If only",
            "Yeah.",
            "If only the font change and the, the, the picture will be same only the nicer and then I'm sure it's OK. So yeah. So first, yeah, the text and is the highest priority.",
            "Hm.",
            "They, then, then the",
            "Sure. Hm. So yeah. So yeah, the figure 4.1 will be deleted. Any other questions about my figures?",
            "Hm, probably not.",
            "Do I have any other interesting figures? Not really.",
            "Just, just avoid an other font, that's fine.",
            "You will have figures in the missing sections like PCA and ICA.",
            "Yeah, probably. Yeah.",
            "And what about figure 4.6?",
            "4.6?",
            "Which is a bit map?",
            "Yeah, well... Yeah.  It is a bit map. Yeah. I think I maybe able to find the source and generate a tix file. Although, um, I will be",
            "is this?",
            "Yes. So I'm sure I can generate a tix file for this big cloud. I will have to rewrite the cropping thing because that's done on the bit map. But yeah. We can leave that after",
            "in the big cloud will be visible? In the  PERSON21 Well, it will be resible, visible as it is visible now. Maybe it will be visible if it's tix. I mean if I",
            "forever to.",
            "Like right now, um... It's, hm... Like it's almost readable now when it's a bit map so if, if it was text it would be readable. Yeah, I mean I can read it.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Even though it's quite ugly at this solution so... Yeah, but OK, I'll, I'll transform this from a bit map into proper text after everything else is done.",
            "And maybe before fixing my arrows.",
            "Hm, well...  I don't know. Like this is just one bit map. Do you have a bunch of arrows everywhere.",
            "Um, and, and the same wholes for, for, for, 4.8 which is a bit map too as, as well.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And, and 4.9\\. which will be English.",
            "OK. And 4.9 and that's not my figure. Actually no. This seems to be vector. Hm. Cool.",
            "Yeah, but at least you can replot it so it, so it has the same font as the book.",
            "Sorry, what?",
            "You can replot it so it has the same font as a book.",
            "Hm. OK. I think about that.",
            "And, and it's truly easy in Inkscape. You just, you just open it in Inkscape as a pdf and save it as a pdf with Latex text labels.",
            "Hm, OK. I would have to install Inkscape for that. I guess I that, can do that.",
            "It's one commented a common line.",
            "Oh.",
            "And, and half of giga byte disk space.",
            "Yeah, that, um   Inkscape.  Well, it says only 170 MB that, yeah.",
            "Hm.",
            "OK, I can do that. After the text is written. And finished.",
            "OK, so please, um... When you finish your part made the lines in the, in the PROJECT3 schůzky document, um, green.",
            "Hm.",
            "So that I know that you, you really have it, the chocolate is reorder in the box.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And so the deadline is today.  Today midnight. And yeah, if I don't see the, the green lines and I don't see that it is really done in the comment I will, I will, I don't know.  Send you something.  Ugly pictures in the",
            "So do you think you can make it to, today or? More or less?",
            "I think so. I The only thing missing for me is add PCA and ICA which I can basically copy from other texts.",
            "Yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.",
            "Yeah, sure. But at least it will be there and then move, move 4.1, 4.2, that's also like 0,5 hour at most and then write something about probing I guess. Well, I think I ca, I can manage to do that today.",
            "OK. And then where it is finished. Or whet it's written somehow we should all of us, we should read it all of book and comment it what is missing where and yeah, where are the problems and other things. I was, um, searching what were the reviewers of the other, um, of the previous ORGANIZATION4 books.",
            "Hm.",
            "And I think that it is not as... For example PERSON10 the word of tokens text and trees, the reviewers are PERSON18, PERSON16.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So this is the last book, um... PERSON14, Sentiment in Czech. So this is written in English at least.  The reviewers PERSON18, PERSON15. So it's really upside LOCATION2. Um... PERSON6, but it was disertation so there would be there his opponent, PERSON18. PERSON18 is everywhere. With like university.  Then this PERSON25. So yeah, so they have like the  PERSON27,. OK, so these are two, like two, two reviewers on outside. But, but, um, I think if we have like, like one reviewer from, from LOCATION2, it's OK. So like... Can we But it, it I think it's better if we have, when we have the book alm, almost finished, we can, we can ask someone. Or Do you mean I should, I should ask someone now?",
            "I think",
            "Yeah.",
            "It would be at least abstract or I don't know if I ask only, OK, we will have a book with about",
            "Hm.",
            "160 pages.",
            "Hm.",
            "And it's about hidden in the layers.",
            "So do we have some kind of abstract at some",
            "We have the preface. Pre",
            "Yeah.",
            "Which is nice. But it's not abstract.",
            "Hm.",
            "It's like the questions.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I was also thinking about the preface don't we need like a real introduction that, that all the books have? Like what exactly you will find in the book, um, how was it structured, how should you read the book...",
            "Yeah.",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah, that, that's missing. Because we have, yeah, after preface we have a background but this is deeplearning.",
            "Yep.",
            "In the begginings of  Yeah. Yeah, so we definitely should have something like introduction. So I will add it into our to do list. And do we have, um, conclusion or sum, summary of our book? I think not yet? Have you have something?",
            "Yeah, summary.",
            "Yeah.",
            "That's the conclusion from my one you need to move.",
            "Yeah, I know, I know. I, I just",
            "Yeah, on it.",
            "Wha, what would be the different between like the",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah. Cause we will have like 3, 3 conclusions.",
            "No.",
            "And then, then one sum, summary.",
            "Alright. We are. Yeah.",
            "One of conclus",
            "Um... I'm not sure if it's, if it's the same? I mean, um, you can have some conclusions that you draw from, from the book, from, from the research you, you need but the summary of, of the book is somethin else. Book, books often have summaries. And, and they have the summaries in multiple languages so... Sometimes.",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah, anyway would we put something different into a book conclusion and into a book summary?",
            "Boo, book, book summary is, is more like, um, lon, longer abstract usually.",
            "Aha.",
            "But the introduction would be also something like, like what, what is the",
            "Hm.",
            "Yeah and I guess",
            "Book about.",
            "The conclusion of the book would also be something like that.  I don't know.",
            "Yeah, it's as a, it's like a paper.",
            "Hm. PERSON9 First you write what are you going to present, then you present it and then you",
            "Yeah.",
            "Write what, what you presented.",
            "Yeah.",
            "But...",
            "PERSON21 brought some books.",
            "What?",
            "That PERSON21 brought some books to, to, to have a look how, how they are structured.",
            "Aha.",
            "And there are no rules, um, it, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in Czech and something like that.",
            "Yeah, the series said that the summary is obligatory. But I don't think it says more about what should be in the summary or, or so. Um... Yeah, summary in English must be in every Czech book. That's the only rule it says.",
            "Aha.",
            "So we have an English book so there is no rule.",
            "So for example PERSON10 has conclu, concluding tokens and then summary. So lets see what he has in this.  What is there? Um... Now lots of tabels, figures... Summary. That was, seems something like abstract.",
            "Hm. Yeah, so it's like one page abstract. Hm.",
            "Yeah. And concluding tokens...",
            "That's more like future so...",
            "Hm. is inside. OK. not introduction. Introduction is not there. But this is like related work is included. OK. So let's We can write the summary which is so kind of abstract and",
            "And if the book is too short we can the summary in Czech.",
            "Yeah, we can. So how, how long is",
            "And in German. And in French.",
            "yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And then we can",
            "We can have a transformer transform the summary into Hindo.",
            "And PERSON10, PERSON10's book is coh, 158 so it's almost the same size of the book.",
            "So are we gonna be like measuring books with   With PERSON10 or what?",
            "So it, yeah. So it, I think it it maybe, yeah. It, it is a book.  It is not like or something.",
            "Hm.",
            "OK. So anything else?",
            "Hm. Who's book in the series is the longest?",
            "I think longest would be the light lexikons.",
            "Or PERSON14 might be a good candidate.",
            "No, no, no. PERSON1, PERSON12, bla, bla, bla, 274.",
            "Hm.",
            "PERSON11, 236.",
            "Hm.",
            "PERSON7, 375.",
            "Wau.",
            "But this is lexikon.",
            "OK.",
            "But other books like PERSON10, 158, PERSON6, 162. Yeah, so wa So is there any book which is shorter than our? So far?  No. PERSON22, 149. But I think we, we'll add some of the, some pictures and will be there. PERSON4, 119.",
            "110.",
            "Yeah, PERSON26, 110. So it is, it is OK. So we, we have to write it somehow and so it's readable, readable and...",
            "wanted to do for",
            "Yeah, it's, yeah.",
            "Yeah, they will do all the, all the erros.",
            "Yeah, they are undefined references not reply defined labels. Some defined cit, citations",
            "Yeah, these are  Yeah, many of these are probably main because I, I don't care so far.  Cause first I want to write a text and then I will, then I will solve the",
            "Hm.",
            "All these errors.",
            "Well, it's hard not to introduce new errors when I, when there is so much errors that I can see if I'm introducing new errors.",
            "Yeah, I agree.",
            "Hm. Yeah, OK. I, I will, I will, I will go through it and, and try to fix that is missing, missing things.",
            "Yeah, so there are some citations that are not in the Zotero format so they're deffinitely will bee always missing.",
            "Hm.",
            "The thing is from my survey.",
            "Might be.",
            "But I think I rewritten them, all of them.",
            "this is, this is for now.",
            "This is for now? Aha.",
            "But it's",
            "Yeah, but this is, this is, yeah, this is in the table.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I haven't  Yeah.",
            "Hm. PERSON9 This is the, the citation from the table.",
            "Hm. PERSON9 So I, I that. OK, so this is the table. So I will, I will comment it althought. Alright.",
            "OK. Hm. There is some missing citation which is also something.",
            "OK, so yeah. So maybe we can, we can end this session and, and finish the writing.",
            "And so the next meeting is?",
            "Yeah, next meeting is, um... The, um...",
            "In two weeks.",
            "In two weeks. Monday. 13th July. Like",
            "OK and",
            "Going to be before, before the PROJECT2 meeting?",
            "After the PROJECT2 meeting it seems.",
            "After?",
            "Um.. So yeah. The meeting is plan, planned 12",
            "Hm. OK, so after. After the meeting.",
            "Um...",
            "But",
            "I don't know. Um, maybe it can be even before. Um, if we want that.",
            "But when will we go to lunch if the meeting is before?",
            "OK, yeah.",
            "Like",
            "So it should be after.",
            "Yeah, OK, it will be after in our office.",
            "Hm. PERSON9 Because here after.",
            "Hm.",
            "So it's lunch, PROJECT2 meeting, PROJECT3 meeting and ORGANIZATION4 beer.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah. I think.",
            "So what's time is the meeting?",
            "2 p.m.",
            "2 p.m.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, the document says that, um, it's true.",
            "OK. I thought you just change the time because of the lunch. So it's still 2 p.m.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, it's 2 p.m. so that we can go to lunch before the PROJECT2 meeting.",
            "Yeah.",
            "OK.",
            "The PROJECT2 meeting is 12",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah, as usual. OK, so I will be sending you many slack messages.",
            "Hm.",
            "If you haven't written everything.",
            "Hm.",
            "And you would, you would need to read all the book and",
            "Yeah.",
            "And we'll see.",
            "Hm, hm, hm. Yeah. Yeah, I have holiday from Thursday but I think I will do some work even in the holiday.",
            "Yeah, I, I have holiday the next week. So the whole the next week I probably will not do anything.",
            "I also officialy have holiday next week but I will be working.",
            "Just an off topic question. Do you plan to watch the ORGANIZATION1 lectures? During the next week? Or what are your plans at ORGANIZATION4?",
            "Potentially, yeah. Um, well, PERSON17",
            "Yeah, we all",
            "Suggested something on ORGANIZATION2. And basically",
            "And no one apply?",
            "He didn't investigate how this really works. But my plan is that if he organised it something that I will join happily.",
            "OK.",
            "Yeah, me too.",
            "But I did, I didn't check the ORGANIZATION1 website. I, I'm not registered for ORGANIZATION1 anyway and I didn't understand much like how it's really works and I didn't have time to investigate it so I'm just waiting so if somebody else like prepares it for me and says me, sit here and watch this and",
            "There are, there are prerecorded presentations and a, after there are broadcasted, there are live QA sessions.",
            "Hm.",
            "This is how the pre, previous presentation looks like. And there are, are tutorials on Sunday.",
            "Hm.",
            "So the presentation will be, presentation will be separated from the, um, question and answering sessions so",
            "Hm. So, so the presentations will be broadcasted like prerecorded and then the QA will be live.",
            "Yes.",
            "That make some sense.",
            "OK. If you want to prevent like situations one, one, no one someone's internet connection presentation or something like that.",
            "Hm. Yeah. But the, um, but the presentations they will still be kind of live. So they will be a broadcast. So it won't be like",
            "Yes.",
            "You can watch it a day before or.",
            "No. Though, though you need to watch it at, at the given time and for each paper there are two time slots.",
            "Hm.",
            "So like people all over the world can watch it.",
            "Do you have to be registered for the tutorials?",
            "Pfff. I don't know. I'm registered.",
            "And did you, did you have to like select tutorial?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK.",
            "Um, but you can, you can ask questions live on ORGANIZATION6. So perhaps all videos who are registered will get ORGANIZATION6 link and will, will be able to ask questions and, and maybe the others can watch it as well, I don't know.",
            "Hm.",
            "Hm, I'd like to watch the interpretability and analysis tutorial.",
            "Yeah, that's",
            "It's with PERSON3.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Aha.",
            "It's some day 2 p.m. if I have recall correctly.",
            "It says here 6 a.m. LOCATION1 time. I don't know what that is.",
            "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is 3 p.m., 3 p.m. our time.",
            "OK. I will be on the train at this time.",
            "Is it necessary to be here in person to watch it or?",
            "In defense we don't know how to links work, yeah, so.",
            "OK.",
            "I think it should work badly if you're here and somebody else also wants to watch the same thing and he's registered which I don't know if, if it will be true.",
            "Yeah.",
            "I don't know how many people are registered actually. I know PERSON17 is registered and PERSON2 is registered and maybe PERSON20 is registered. And I don't know if people can watch if they're not registered. Or unless they're watching someone",
            "Share the links.",
            "Yeah.",
            "And the password or I don't know.",
            "I don't know. I haven't look into it. So I don't know how it works. You know something more? You're registered so you don't care and",
            "Yeah.",
            "Yeah.",
            "be this like screening here or other.",
            "Yeah. I think that's kind of the plan but, um, yeah. It definitely at least depends on what other people want to watch.",
            "Hm.",
            "So I don't know how many paralel sessions there are but I a lot again.",
            "So if, if, if, if PERSON17 is there registered one and the one on what sessions all the time.",
            "It's possible. Like one of could registered as well. But I don't know how we would for it.",
            "because we, we need to pay for it and if we don't have any, any paper there.",
            "Yeah.",
            "So... So anything else or we can, we can end this session and... So see you.",
            "Alright.",
            "Bye.",
            "Have a nice day you.",
