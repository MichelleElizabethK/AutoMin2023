( inaudible ). pERSON08083 : (DE ) Mr President, i also took part in the debate this morning. i did not have the impression that you were unfair or abused your office in any way. on the contrary...( uproar ) i would like to say, on the opposite, that you listened with great patience and respect as the chairman of this so-called group demonstrated to us that he is a
pERSON097 : would a representative of the Committee like to say something about this? perhaps Mr Leinen? are you proposing a change to the voting order? i have to say we were not expecting this change. no such proposal has been made. any such proposal? pERSON101 : maybe it was my fault. i am sorry. i apologize. pERSON102 : (DE ) Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. you will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. instead, we will have an official presence in the EU

pERSON107 : (FR ) Mr President, i can assure you that the speed of the vote is perfect. you are a very polite man and we are very grateful to you for that, but we could make even faster progress if you did not say 'thank you' after every vote, but only at the end of the go! thank you, Mr President!!! pERSON108 : thank you! person110 : (IT ) male president, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which i am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr lópez Aguilar and Mr Ber
pERSON256 : Mr president, i would like to start by emphasising how pleased i am that we are able to sign the telecoms package together today. The package strengthens competition and the protection of consumers in Europe. we will have modern and up-to-date regulations in an area where development is very rapid. the three rapporteurs are most deserving of credit, as also is the Chairman of the committee on Industry, research and energy, our fellow Member Mr reul, and Vice-President of Parliament, Mr vidal- quadras, who chaired the EP delegation to the Conciliation committee. i would also
pERSON150 : Mr President, we are now going to sign a number of legal acts that are absolutely central to the EU's response to the financial and economic crisis that has hit euro so hard and that will continue to have an impact. i would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency, which worked very hard to get these acts in place within a short time. it was thanks to the Czech presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and the commission, as well as quick, effective agreements. к€150 : i would also like to point out that Mrs starkevič
pERSON097 : as proposed, we are carrying out a trial vote, i.e. a vote to check that we all have cards, we are all seated properly and that the equipment is working. ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat: i have an official statement. Under Rule 105(3 ) of the Rules of Procedure, i shall inform the council and the newly-elected President of the Commission to propose jointly the nominees for the posts of Commissioners. in view of the amount of work ahead of us, we should work as quickly as possible. ( loud applause ) ( applause ) pERSON099
pERSON069 : Many thanks, Mrs Roure. i can see that even the top jurists here in plenary, or those who see themselves as such, are unaware that the rapporteur is entitled to make a two-minute statement when a report has not been discussed in plinary. Therefore, i repeat once again : we have a collective responsibility.(Applause ) : to take action so that things change. pERSON068 : indeed. (
pERSON072 : ladies and gentlemen, please excuse me and accept my thanks for your patience. i would like to thank my colleagues at the committee on International trade and, most of all, the shadow rapporteurs of the two largest groups, Mrs Saïfi and Mrs Locatelli, and offer my heartfelt thanks to the secretariat and to dr Bendini in particular. i believe that after all our work, we are today handing shared thoughts and proposals to the Commission, on a topic close to Mrs Ashton's heart, as we heard from her opening speech as Commissioner, and one that must be tackled without delay if
pERSON078 : Mr President, we found that it would not be fair to mention just one of the parties, so we would like to take out the reference to the Kosovo authorities. The amendment would then read: 'Underlines the importance of full regional economic cooperation and the obligation to comply with and fully implement the provisions of the CEFTA Agreement'.
rapporteur. - pERSON082 : i would ask colleagues not to oppose this oral amendment in the form of an addition to paragraph 64a. that addition reads as follows: 'where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO'. so the last part of paragraph 64i will read as follows :'supports Taiwan's participation as an observer in relevant international organisations where this doesnot require stateliness, for instance, in the ie ief'.
pERSON245 : author. - madam president, including the word 'humanitarian' aid, which is just to make it clear what kind of aid we are talking about. but the important thing is to declare a 'no-fire period', which is the wording in the Co-Chairs' declaration. is this right? is this correct? pERSON244 : yes, there is something, but i do not know if this is a misunderstanding or not. In theory, the version that we have from the oral amendment is that the text should read 'cease-fire', not 'non-fire'. is this
pERSON259 : author. - Madam President, i notice once again that the officials have not actually written the oral amendments in the same order as they are actually voted on, so i will be very careful to pick the right order myself this time. for paragraph 2, we want to add the words at the end of the paragraph, 'as well as deliberate impoverishment, arbitrary taxation and land confiscation'.'. ok? pERSON255 : author. - madam president, recital e should read as follows : 'Stresses that the boat people issue which affects Thailand and other countries is essentially a regional one ; welcomes
pERSON006 : i would like, most of all, to express the hope that our work with other European institutions in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, which enters into force in a week, will flow smoothly. i draw your attention to this important date, because this area is one of the main interests of the european union, and rightly so. we should always remember this matter. in two weeks, on 10 December, it will be the 61st anniversary of the adoption and proclamation by the General Assembly of the united nations of the Universal Declaration of human rights. it is important that we always, and not only on this
pERSON060 : (RO ) the imperialist policy of support for Israel by the USA and NATO and the upgrading of relations and of the issues in general contained in the EU-Israel association Agreement are strengthening the aggression and intransigence of europe's citizens in the new area of freedom, security and justice. This is shameful for the whole of the European Union! pERSON065 : ( hu ) i would like to draw your attention to the topic which Cornelia Ernst spoke about earlier. i am talking about the start, following the negotiation and signing of readmission agreements, of the process of resettling those

Furthermore, i also regret that the Council is not here today. that is regrettable. pERSON123 : (0 ) pERSON122 : (IT ) Mr president, ladies and gentlemen, my comment will be brief. it firstly concerns the substance and secondly the procedure, and i think that it would be equally laudable for us that the police and Europol work as effectively as possible. on the other
pERSON007 : - (FR ) Madam President, as quaestor of this Parliament, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that the route to the Parliament entrance is blocked on one side by riot police. they are not allowing official cars to enter. if some Members arrive late because they have to make another detour, they should not be penalised if they cannot take part in the voting. is this understood? pERSON006 : Mr Cohn-bendit, you will have an answer before the start of the sitting, but for now, if you do not mind, we will proceed with
pERSON297 : Mr president, could you verify whether there are 40 Members here, because it is very difficult to tell? i do not see them. pERSON298 : Mrs Gill, i think that, especially since this afternoon, i am beginning to learn Rule 149 by heart. you are referring to paragraph 5. it is the job of the President of the sitting, and him alone, if he decides to do so at any time, to establish that a quorum is not present. however, given the importance of the votes that we are going to hold, especially on the case of a person sentenced to death, i
pERSON071 : (FR ) Mr president, ladies and gentlemen, i am grateful to ipanda071 for taking part in this vote. pERSON072 : ( rambunctious ) : some things have happened in the last few minutes : i'm grateful to the Chairman of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, who contributed a great deal on this issue. She and i are both asking you to turn out in huge numbers and vote. i am counting on you. pERSON070 : (
pERSON008 : today we are commemorating the fourth European day of the victims of terrorism. the terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 -four years ago today - and in London on 7 July 2005 claimed many victims and left many families torn apart by the barbarities of terrorism. i can repeat often enough that there is absolutely no justification for terrorism. we must therefore take a united approach in this fight on the basis of the rule of law and with all the force of the law. ladies and gentlemen, please rise from your seats for a minute's silence in memory of the victim of terrorism (The house rose and observed
pERSON116 : co-rapporteur. - Mr president, it is the second one. it was indeed about the deposit guarantee schemes. We tried to strengthen the present text by asking that these rules in the European union be 'urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence'. then it says they should also guarantee a level playing field for financial institutions. Sorry for this.(Parliament agreed to accept both oral amendments)- before the vote on Amendment 8:30 p.m. - pERSON119: co-
pERSON124 : To summarise the situation, our rapporteur is not proposing an amendment to the text. He simply wants to ensure that after the vote the services reorganise the final text as he has just proposed. In any case, i would like to inform you why i, as rapporteur, put seven minuses against the amendments of the Socialist Group. It was a question of my credibility because six of those seven amendments were refused in the ENVI Committee three weeks ago. There were no votes against, and i see no new reasons to change my opinion on this. the other reason is that we adopted a resolution on
pERSON110 : Mr President, it is exactly the same subject and it is to add to the words in Recital F: 'whereas the Arctic region is currently not governed by any specifically formulated multilateral norms and regulations'.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)- Before the vote on recital d: 'the protection of biodiversity in our amendment ) ( pERSON106 : pERSON108 : Mr president, people should have details of this oral amendment. It is to make clear why the united Nations Convention on the law of the sea is not sufficient on its own to deal with the Arctic. so it adds the

pERSON094 : (PT ) i am pleased to see that the chairwoman of the committee responsible agrees with the analysis of the sittings services. Therefore, Mrs Kauppi, i am sorry but i cannot carry out your request. can you clarify this for us? pERSON098 : (FR ) Mr President, i believe that Mrs Kauffi is mistaken because Amendment 4 by Mr Klinz relates to the same paragraph as Amendment 2 by Mrs Kauphi. as the house has voted on Amendment 2 for years, as the basis of amendment 4 falls. so we should have voted on amendment 4
pERSON026 : (EL ) Mr President, as the question of Slovakia and Bulgaria is a serious matter, i too should like to request that you ask the European Commission, which is after all the guardian of the Treaties and the Treaty of Accession, to tell us exactly what is happening and why these two countries took this decision.

pERSON103 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on extending the duration of ENISA's mandate by three years, to 2012, which also matches the Council's decision. ENISA is the European Network and Information Security Agency, which we, together with the council, brought into being five years ago.itely, i would ask you all, most urgently, to again approve this three-year extension and to make an effort to get involved in the debate on the future of this Agency.
147 : rapporteur. - Mr president, this legislation is very necessary as the current legislation on residue control has led to a serious decrease in the availability of authorised veterinary medicines, creating adverse effects for public and animal health and welfare. i would like to urge the presidency, particularly the incoming french Minister, to make this dossier a priority to help to resolve the crisis in availability, especially for what we call minor uses and so-called minor species, which include sheep, horses, bees, fish and many other animals that are not so minor in many of our countries.
pERSON132 : (IT ) male president, ladies and gentlemen, i do not want to make any comment on what Mrs Jackson has just said. i think, however, and this is something that the Group of the Greens/European free Alliance has always called for, that we should have better regulation on the issue of conflicts of interest, given that this Parliament, as a co-legislator, will in the future need to be and increasingly today needs to be transparent and correct: not only transparent, that is to say, but also correct, with regard to its Members' conflicts of interests.- after the vote: (
pERSON007 : (FR ) male president, this request - some here in this house are bound to recall, Mr President, President-in-Office of the council - relates to the fact that at the end of last year we had to renegotiate the practical arrangements for the implementation of this partnership agreement with the Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2012 - c6-0199/2008 -.Mr Morillon has the floor to give the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.
pERSON150 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached an agreement with the Council and the Commission concerning Amendments 37 and 52. The compromise refers respectively to the financing of small non-governmental organisations and the maximum level of financing of NGOs. The commission and the council have agreed to include a statement with the first-reading agreement and i would like to ask the Commissioner, whom i do not see here, but he made the declaration last night during the discussion ; he presented the statement included with the agreement... in any case, if there is anyone here who wants to present the agreement on behalf of the Commission. In any

pERSON482 : Member of the commission. - (DE ) the honourable Members will know that in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council establishing the ENISA Agency, the mandate of ENISA automatically expires on 13 March 2009. however, the commission and the council have agreed to the extension of the body's operation until the end of 2012. This three-year extension will enable further debate on the future of security of networks and information in europe. i therefore call on the european parliament to open, early in 2009, an intense debate on europe's approach to network security and on the
130 : rapporteur. - Mr president, with regard to the four reports to be voted on, i would like to thank the Commission, the council under the Slovenian Presidency, and the current french Presidency for the spirit of cooperation and agreement and for the way they have managed these four Community programmes. the fact that these four reports have been accepted by both the Commission and the council is particularly satisfying and gives hope for future interinstitutional agreement.
pERSON147 : rapporteur. - Mr president, ladies and gentlemen, let me briefly mention Integrated Coastal Zone Management, designed, above all, to protect fisheries and fish farming. Because i believe that all of us desire the protection of the ocean, i ask you to vote in favour and i thank you in advance.
pERSON497 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE group. - (PL ) i would like to thank my colleagues in the committee on women's rights and gender equality and especially the shadow rapporteur for excellent and constructive contributions to the report. i congratulate the Commissioner because she has often shown through her proposals that she is taking measures to protect minors and safeguard values with the help of the media and especially modern technologies. thank you. pERSON501 : (SK ) - ( pl ) pERSON502 : ( PL ) - pERSON514 : ( pERSON49 : (ERSON5050 ) # pERSON51 : on

At that point we, as Parliament, pleaded for better provision of information to the employees involved or European citizens who move freely in Europe. at the

pERSON102 : Mr President, the accession of the EU to the Transport Protocol of the Alpine Convention is a small but perfectly formed piece in the jigsaw of a new transport policy in Europe. we Austrians feel reassured by the fact that it was we who introduced our European Community to a great many of these concerns, and that this has led to Europe taking on these concerns.Many thanks to all the Members who contributed to this.
pERSON117 : rapporteur. - Mr President, Parliament has moved from its first-reading position on the Electricity and Gas Directive. i would just like briefly to explain why.2 : we have made substantial gains for energy consumers in the European union. we have put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we have ensured the independence of the national regulatory authorities and given them an increased role to police the new system.we would like, however, to encourage the Commission and, in particular, the competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generation and transmission systems play by
pERSON126 : Member of the Commission. - i would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, representatives of the commission and the council, the administration of the committee on Internal Market and Consumer protection and interested parties for their help and cooperation. i propose adoption of the directive, which will contribute to increased protection of the environment, operators and their surroundings when applying pesticides. the following is the position of the
pERSON130 : 'The same reference exchange rates shall be applied to annually revise the value of the charges governed by Articles 4a, 4b and 6a(3 ) where these charges are denominated in currencies other than the euro.'Mr president, this is a minor modification requested by the Council in order to remove an inconsistency about the exchange rates applicable for SMS caps and the cut-off limit. Therefore, as agreed with the Council, the following text should be added at the end of Article 1(4 ) of the original regulation, which is Article 1, point 2(b), of the amending regulation: '
pERSON143 : (DE ) Mr President, i should like to say that, in its debate and its papers, Parliament has called on both the Commission and the council to state that, if Parliament were to call for this agreement to be suspended or revoked, they would do so. The statements were very different. The President-in-Office of the council expressed no opinion at all as to how the Council would react if Parliamentwere to callfor this. The Commissioner merely replied that the commission would give some thought to what it would do if Parliament made this request. My point is that Parliament's demands have in no way been
pERSON137 : Member of the commission. - Mr President, i would like to express my appreciation and admiration for the efficient handling of the Solvency II file by the European Parliament and for your willingness to compromise. with solvency ii, the EU will have a modern framework for insurance supervision, which will then be official for the Member States and the industry enough time to prepare for the introduction of Solventy II. i personally regret the deletion of the group support regime, because it is a missed opportunity to make further progress in group supervision. however, the Commission will support the agreement between Parliament and the Council if it
134 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the commission welcomes the adoption of the Weber report endorsed in the compromise text on simplified reporting and documentation requirements in the case of mergers and divisions of public limited liability companies. -Mr president, this will maintain a very significant part of the savings potential of the original Commission proposal, which amounts to EUR 172 million per year.
pERSON091 : Mr president, ladies and gentlemen, the reason we are able to conclude this procedure at first reading is that we have succeeded in bringing about excellent cooperation across the group divide and with the other institutions. For this, i should like to offer particular thanks to my fellow MEPs, the Council, the Commission, the secretariat of the committee on Industry, research and energy, the European Economic and social committee and, of course, the large body of researchers behind it all. we now have within reach concerted European research, in the context of future cooperation between the 22 National Metrology Institutes. this will introduce substantial
pERSON282 : (DE ) madam President, Mr Farage claimed this morning that i had said, in this house, that 'a “no” vote will lead to fascism'. 'in previous times Martin Schulz has stood up and said that a “ no” voting will lead, fascism'. i have never said that - never! - and i would like to clarify this point once and for all now. i do not believe that a 'no' vote by any given population - like the Irish population, for example - leads to fascism. that is not my belief. That is now clear once and
pERSON047 : many thanks, Mr Gargani. i would also, of course, like to extend our thanks to our Secretary-General, who has been a formidable negotiator on this issue, i am sure that Parliament welcomes your statement. we will now proceed to a roll-call vote to close an issue that has been pending for almost 30 years. let me just savour this moment.- after the vote of the house. pERSON046 : rapporteur. - (IT ) pERSON049 : thank you everybody. i can confirm today our agreement on this text, which preserves the full substance of our initial proposal.
isp : (DE ) rapporteur for the capital Requirements Directive and one comitology proposal. i would ask you to support the motion for a resolution, which was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. this will allow the European Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission. We are demanding an appropriate balance between matters which are proposed by the Commission in the codecision procedure and matters which were handled by the commission alone within the comitological procedure. (Applause ) (
pERSON056 : Vice-President of the Commission. - mr president, yes, of course i will follow up on that. i will make sure that you get a reply as soon as possible. we have not yet received an acknowledgement, never mind a reply. Could she perhaps raise this with colleagues in the Commission? it is a matter of great importance to this House. thank you, i will reply. pERSON054 : thank you.
035 : rapporteur. - Mr president, i would like to make a very small point but an important point of principle. The committee has come up with an agreement in trialogue, and subject to the will of the house that should go through. it is not a bad agreement, but it has raised an important issue of principle which i think should bring before the presidency regarding future dossiers. it is called democracy, and i recommend the idea to the Bureau.(Applause )

Unfortunately, i have now had another such report on the agenda. i would be grateful if the services could clarify this. i thank you for your help.
pERSON125 : Mr President, i will read it in English as amended: 'whereas the effect of the joint operations coordinated by FRONTEX is to create an 'externalisation of borders', which could call into question Member States' compliance with the EU's obligations concerning the protection of asylum-seekers and refugees'. with this oral amendment, my group - and, i think, several other groups - will be able to support the amendment tabled by the gUE/NGL Group.
129 : in a spirit of Christmas compromise, we would like, in an oral amendment, to withdraw paragraph 15 from our resolution, in order to enable more people to vote for it. pERSON129 : Mr President, many of our colleagues want to vote in favour of the idea in the Green resolution not to make internet providers and telecom providers responsible for the content on the internet and so on, but many of those colleagues who want to perform the duties of responsible, in case of instance, paragraph 15, which is related to another subject.
pERSON082 : rapporteur. - (DE ) Mr President, this concerns the European schools in Brussels. we have discussed this at length in the course of many talks. The figures previously in the text need to be tightened somewhat, as we want the Commission to really take action. Therefore, the new text also sets a deadline for it to do so. i shall read it out in English again:'Notes with concern the situation of present and future young pupils in the European Schools in Brussels resulting from the delayed and still pending opening of the fourth school in Laeken and the current enrolment procedure leading to long and unacceptable

(applause) ( inaudible ) : i should also like to say that a delegation from the national assembly of Vietnam is with us today on the occasion of the 7th EP/Vietnam Interparliamentary Meeting. a very welcome to you all!
pERSON106 : ladies and gentlemen, you were of the opposite opinion a moment ago. let us then vote now on whether to take a vote. let's do it. pERSON107 : (DE ) male president, it would make sense for you to get together with the Conference of Presidents to consider the introduction of a general procedure. i would certainly welcome the one followed yesterday, but we should always use the same voting system in such cases. i do not want to comment. person106 : i gather from your reaction that you support him : i am going to submit the three declarations to you, and they can
pERSON093 : rapporteur. - (SL ) it is clear from the joint report of the Council and the commission for 2008 that some progress has been made as regards lifelong learning, but we cannot be satisfied with the achievements so far. i call on the governments of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union not to cut resources for education at this time of financial crisis, because high-quality education that is available to all sections of the population is the best weapon against poverty and the best tool for finding a solution to the crisis. thank you to all my fellow Members and to the Bureau for your cooperation.(App

pERSON065 : many thanks, Mr swoboda ; we shall look into the matter. i thank you for your speech. thank you. pERSON067 : on behalf of the gUE/nGL group. - ( s v ) male president, i should like to make a request further to yesterday's debate with the french Presidency. i would simply like to extend a very warm welcome to Mr Mohamed Abdelaziz, President of the Sahrawi Arab democratic Republic and Secretary general of the polisario front, and the delegation accompanying him. they have returned to Parliament to remind us of the importance of safegu
pERSON085 : thank you very much. ladies and gentlemen, i hope i speak on behalf of everyone here when i say that the European Parliament has been extremely cooperative with the Council, and also when i state officially that the way in which we have reached a decision on this must be the exception rather than the rule, and that, in future, we must insist on a first reading here in principle, in order to make Parliament's position clear.(Applause ) (
pERSON090 : (S v ) i would like to say a sincere thank you to Alejandro and everyone else who has worked on this issue. i do not see the Council here today. we have tried to get negotiations with the Council under way, but they have been unwilling to come to the negotiating table. now we see a large majority here in Parliament. let us now come to conciliation, so that we can produce a good Working time Directive.now we can reconciling work and family life can become a reality, together with the social Europe.(Loud applause ) : Сperson089 : ( siva )
pERSON077 : (DE ) Mr president, my justification is as follows. unfortunately, no plenary debate, the result of which we could have taken to the trialogue, was held on eTS. Trialogue negotiations merely on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are not representative of Parliament. now, we are supposed to endorse the amendments to the Commission's proposal ; but what we are trying to be deciding on today matches the Council paper one-to-one. There is not a single alteration by Parliament, even so much as a comma. what is the reason
pERSON156 : yes, you are correct Mr Jarzembowski: Amendment 12 falls. correct? pERSON157 : (DE ) Mr President, this second amendment can absolutely be viewed as complementary. there is no contradiction. The two amendments do not preclude one another.(Uproar in the Chamber ) : uproar. pERSON158 : could the rapporteur, Mr Albertini, give us his opinion? can you just confirm that again?! pERSON159 : mr. president, ladies and gentlemen, i agree with what our coordinator, Mr Jarxembowski, said: amendment 12 falls. p
pERSON180 : it is indeed an appropriate moment to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work, and to wish him a speedy and happy recovery. i would just correct her to say the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.Therefore, i propose that the vote on the admissibility of these amendments should take place at the end, since at that point the Presidency will have the facts it needs to decide whether or not they are admissible. otherwise, we would have to decide now without sufficient information. therefore, if the honour
pERSON148 : rapporteur. - Mr President, we have to vote on Amendments 109 and 124 too - the corresponding part.Concerning Article 7, Amendment 57, only if the first part is adopted will Amendments 106 and 117 fall.Conconcerning Article 9, Amendment 102, if all of them are adopted, Amendment 60 will fall. Otherwise we have of course to vote only the vote on variations : 60. otherwise... pERSON147 : thank you Mrs Ţicău, we take due note of your observation.- Before the votes on Amendments109 and 124:
pERSON151 : Mr president, one moment just to tell you that this is an important report because it introduces a European regulation on rating agencies, and is therefore an element of the response to the crisis. for Parliament's vote to comply, it is better for you to reject the amendments, except in the case of the votes on Amendment 172, corresponding parts. i wish, also, to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr pittella and Mr klinz, and all of those who worked on this important issue.
pERSON143 : Yes, Mr Gahler, i would like very much to do as you wish, and i am not doing it today because the association of European Journalists has asked that we detail the votes. if we do not, the result cannot be duly recorded, and they rightly state that if they do not know the result of the vote, perhaps you could just announce 'adopted' or'rejected' rather than reading out the individual figures. (DE )
pERSON163 : thank you, Mrs Bowles. it is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley. - pERSON164 : rapporteur. - mr President, i do not think this can be added as an addition. it should be taken separately. therefore, i would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81. if indeed that is the case. pERSON 163 : thanks, mrs. Bowles. thank you. mr. Crowley.it
193 : rapporteur. - (Sv ) pERSON193 : there is no reason to justify why we would choose not to grant discharge or to delay discharge now that we have granted it. so that we can keep things consistent, i propose that our group support the Socialist Group's proposals and vote in favour of the next four amendments tabled by the Socialist group in the European Parliament. - ( sv )
pERSON137 : i would now like to welcome a delegation from Iraq, on the occasion of their visit to our Parliament. (Applause )Mr Khalid al Atiyah, First Vice-President of the house of Representatives of the Republic of Iraq, chairs this delegation. it gives me great pleasure to emphasise the encouraging progress made in Iraq on matters of security and the rule of law, to which the provincial elections held last January bear witness, and we hope that the many problems and difficult years that this country has experienced will very soon be overcome. they can rest assured that the euro union and this Parliament will always be at
pERSON084 : (DE ) male president, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Simpson has just said is really quite abstruse ; indeed, he turns the whole matter on its head. there are certain industries which attempt to block legislation in the interests of their companies. in my long years in this Parliament i cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one. we are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on. i do not think that the consumers will
pERSON257 : author. - male president, the two amendments relate firstly to Article 9. we have a specific request from the UNHCR that it not be mentioned in the resolution. i think that this is absolutely acceptable and, according to this amendment, i ask for the words'starting to notably work together with the UNHCR and others' to be deleted. please note that in this amendment we also include him's oral amendment, in which he also asked for the opposition members to be included. i must also point out that this would be in total contradiction to what was proposed by my colleague, Mr Hutchinson's, but to oppose
pERSON146 : rapporteur. - (Sv ) madam president, i would simply like to say that the Commission tabled a proposal in this new, important political area which meant that we thought implementing measures in the current legislation would be sufficient. Parliament is now very clearly requesting that the commission carry out an overhaul of all of the relevant legislation so that we can protect consumers, workers and the environment from the negative effects of nanoproducts and so that they can have a market that is safe and that is able to develop. i would like to remind you that i - (
pERSON153 : yes, we are definitely going to check all of the language versions, Mrs Pack.? pERSON : i would like to ask whether you realise that, in Article 6, the word 'central' before the word state needs to be deleted to make the wording consistent with the other texts.
pERSON139 : i must say, Mr Staes, that we had already considered this issue, and that we are indeed going to look at this because it is a real issue and a real problem. i should therefore like to ask the Bureau and Parliament's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before Parliament goes into recess after 7 May, so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part-session. thank you.
pERSON143 : (DE ) Madam President, there is no reason for me to explain how my group's voting list is put together. we have discussed it and, after re-examining it, we are able to give our full support to this motion.pERSON142 : (FR ) madam president, i would like to speak at this point, because we in the Committee on economic and Monetary Affairs had a significant debate on the issues surrounding the loan, and the Group of the European people's Party (Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats had tabled an amendment considering that there was no legal basis for a
pERSON109 : (DE ) madam President, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that behind me, among the far-right radicals, there are people who are not Members, and as far as i can see, they are also using the voting cards.( uproar ). pERSON110 : Mr Martin, all of that will be verified. after the vote, i will make a statement. person108 : Mr Tannock, i have been informed and all of the linguistic corrections will be made. afterthe vote,
pERSON121 : rapporteur. - ( hu ) will not need to take up two minutes. i would like to draw your attention to two very important facts regarding the report. these reports have been compiled for years, but the Council has not even once yet included these reports on its agenda. i think that it would be very important for the Council to make Member States aware of the content of this report. this would help, to a large extent, to also make the Council's and other institutions' discharge procedure work successfully. This is why i am suggesting that the postponement of the Council's autumn discharge procedure should
pERSON115 : - (FR ) Madam President, i will be very brief on this point. as one of our fellow Members has made an accusation, i will ask him to clarify his accusation. as you said, the verification needs to take place immediately, and if, as i believe, it turns out after verification that the accusation is false, i ask that all the conclusions be drawn from this. ( inaudible ). pERSON114 : i have just said that it will be verified. That means that itwill be verified immediately. we are dealing with it. it is verified immediately. i thank you.
i : thank you. pERSON006 : ladies and gentlemen, i am saddened and dismayed to have to inform you today that, last weekend, more than 300 people were drowned when a number of refugee boats went down in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya. these boats were carrying people from North and sub-Saharan Africa. some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing. i would ask you now to observe a minute's silence in memory of the dead.(The house rose and observed a minute'silence ) thank you
pERSON022 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE group. - (DE ) pERSON018 : male president, our request is based on a very clear fact known to everyone. At the end of last May, an official delegation from our Parliament, representing all political groups, went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza.On the basis of what they observed on the ground, at the end end of this visit, they unanimously adopted a statement. this statement includes the following:'we strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on- ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU
ladies and gentlemen, you know that a week ago today, on 26 November, a dramatic series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in the city of Azpeitia, in the Basque country of mumbai in the european union. i have just heard the terrible news that less than an hour ago a 70-year-old businessman, Mr Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, was murdered - it is said by eTA, it is not yet confirmed - in the Spanish town of Azpeiitia, in theBasque country. i should like to express my deep sadness and profound sympathy to the family and friends
pERSON175 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i take every opportunity to extend every sympathy to the Conakry victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones' remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre. i also would like to say that i regard the acts of violence committed in Guinea as absolutely appalling. i see that two hours ago, the French Foreign Minister stated that Dadis camara is assumed to have been involved in the decision to carry out the massacre, which is an extremely serious state of
pERSON215 : (ES ) Mr President, it is with extreme urgency that call on Parliament to see that the EUR 14.8 million promised to the workers in the mid-west of Ireland in areas like Limerick, Kerry and others who worked for Dell Computers and its suppliers is allocated as soon as possible. i would also like to call on my fellow colleagues to take special care of the injured and the dead. that is our objective. pERSON201 : ( hu ) ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said today about minority issues. i regret to inform you that, on the third anniversary of
pERSON266 : (PL ) madam president, ladies and gentlemen, the large bankruptcies of airline companies this year force us to consider again whether the unified internal market for air transport is functioning properly. accordingly, i would like to thank the committee on transport and tourism for taking ownership of this issue. i am grateful to Mr Simpson and to the entire Committee on Transport and Tourism for bringing such a sensitive issue to the attention of Parliament. it is therefore essential that we do something about it. pERSON257 : (RO ) if we want to have an efficient internal market, we need to have a certain minimum protection for passengers
pERSON022 : (IT ) male president, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, and also speaking on behalf of Mr La Via, i would like to take the floor briefly just to express our disappointment over the postponement of the vote on mobilisation of the Solidarity fund for the Abruzzo region. The vote has been postponed by two weeks and will take place during the part-session in Strasbourg. i merely wished to correct what you said: these reports have been adopted in committee. there is no legal obstacle. they were even adopted unanimously. we must act in accordance with the
pERSON129 : (SL ) i would like to comment on the remarks made at the beginning of voting when fellow members attempted to use the unplanned event at the Krško nuclear power station as an illustration of the unsafe performance of nuclear power plants. i should point out that the event was indeed unplanned, that it involved a component failure, that the plant was not shut down but rather had its operations safely suspended, and that repairs on it are under way. the operation of the power station is transparent and fellow members can find information on it on the website of the country's nuclear safety administration. i should also add that
pERSON099 : rapporteur. - (DE ) Mr president, we have already held the debate on this item in Strasbourg, so i do not need to discuss it further today. for the so-called 12-day trips, we have achieved an excellent cross-party compromise, also with the submission of the outcomes of the social partners' negotiations. Indeed, we could say that we have improved upon the social brothers' compromise here in the house. i hope that you are right. ( sic ) pERSON098 : well... pERSON100 : the various language versions will be checked. i.e
088 : rapporteur. - (DE ) Mr president, i would like to give you some brief information and voice an appeal to the Council which, yet again, is absent. The Member States and the euro Union wish to, and must, take more ambitious and effective action against corruption. That is why the European Parliament has endorsed the establishment of a contact-point network against corruption. - (de ) (DE) Mr president, i said, having voted unanimously in favour of such a move.
pERSON076 : (IT ) male president, ladies and gentlemen, i should like very briefly to endorse my colleague's request. we have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past. Maximum transparency is required, not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter. as far as my country is concerned, we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia, which moreover currently holds the presidency. maximum transparency. with that, we close that particular item. The Commission will take note. we will now proceed with our normal business.(The Minutes of
pERSON091 : rapporteur. - (FR ) ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present, not just because of the increase in the price of diesel, for which sustainable, global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions, but alsobecause of the poor management of fisheries resources, over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase -- the increase... the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market. this highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector, which is
pERSON078 : in fact, this is absolutely not what the services had understood, but we shall of course go along with our rapporteur. therefore, if i have understood correctly, we are going to vote on the amendments to the report on Turkmenistan, not to your report. then we shall stop before the final vote.- before the vote on amendment 2 and the assent report. pERSON079 : on behalf of the pse-Group. - pERSON080 : i shall put the request for postponement to the vote! (Parliament decided to postpone the full vote ). person080 :
pERSON068 : (FR ) Mr President, it is all the same astounding, that statement. i simply wished to say to my fellow Members that i am one of the authors of the alternative resolution. we are in the European Union, not the Soviet Union.(Applause ). pERSON069 : i am sure, Mrs lulling, that this detail had not escaped the Members of this House, but i gave the floor to our rapporteur because she did not have the opportunity to speak during the debates. as you know, she is entitled to two minutes ; therefore, for two minutes the rapporteur
pERSON094 : i can confirm that, if an oral amendment is to be adopted, it must be expressed orally, which has not been the case, in spite of my request. You have therefore understood perfectly. there is just one slight point of confusion for me. The oral amendment was on the voting list but nobody stood up to support it. Does that mean that it fell and did not come to the vote at all? is that correct?
pERSON073 : rapporteur. - (DA ) male president, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups. i would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work. Furthermore, after five years of working on this issue, i ask you to reject the two alternative motions for resolution and voting in favour of the Auken report.(Applause ) - (
pERSON062 :... the programme of food distribution, like the 'fruit at School' and'milk at School'programmes, is changing attitudes towards the EU, and because of this the EU is becoming friendlier and closer to two important social groups - the deprived and young people. Therefore i ask for a vote in favour of this report. in doing so we will show that the European Parliament is close to the people and their problems.(Applause )
pERSON162 : And Mr Beazley is a very devout member of the pPE-DE Group!( laughter ) pERSON161 : without objection! pERSON162! patti, ( as interpreter ) : so much for the roll-call vote! pablo, as interpreter : : : without further ado, let me say that
134 : Mr President, in my judgement, the introduction of this beautiful high technology here was intended to save our time and increase our efficiency. You know my respect for the manner in which you preside here, but could you spare us the enumeration of the results in such detail. you can declare 'adopted' or 'not adopted'. this is enough. we have everything on our screens
pERSON120 : on behalf of the pPE-DE group. - pERSON126 : i am sorry to prolong this discussion, but may i build on what was just said by my colleagues, Mrs Doyle and Mrs frassoni? as one of the authors of several of the amendments, i was in contact with the President's office until 11.50 and could not obtain a clear 'yes' or 'no' as to whether the amendments we tabled - 136 to 139 - would be voted upon or not. we do not understand why some amendments are inadmissible. could you clarify that as we proceed to
114 : ladies and gentlemen, europe, as the ancestral home of culture, cannot continue to do nothing in the face of these problems that make it suffer. ladies and gentlemen, european artists are not immune from the continuing existence of major inequalities between men and women. for example, it is important to widen the practice of holding auditions behind a screen in recruiting orchestral musicians, by analogy with the existing business practice of viewing anonymous cVs, partly because it is the only way that women will get jobs as orchestrstral soloists and also because it was a good way of combating racial discrimination.
pERSON141 : rapporteur. - Mr president, i have no objection to this oral amendment by Mr Swoboda, which refers to the original text. in any case, i was told by the tabling office that this amendment is valid only for the amended one. if that is not so, i am in favour of this oral contribution being part of the original. therefore, those who are following my advice will vote against the first part in this fifth vote and then we shall have an extra vote, which is not on the voting list, on this oral addition, which i support. i agree. pERSON140 :
pERSON012 : (PT ) madam President, just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week. Wednesday 11 March is the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. This day was proposed in the first place by Parliament in a vote that took place on 11 March 2004. We were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom, security and justice. it was the day of the tragic attacks in Madrid. i therefore encourage you to confirm this approval in this morning's vote.... pERSON013 : madam president, ladies and gentlemen, it is my understanding that the President will make a statement tomorrow at the
pERSON008 : i would like to extend a very warm welcome to His Eminence the Metropolitan Galaktion of Stara zagora in Bulgaria, who is seated with a delegation of Orthodox clergy in the distinguished visitors' gallery.(Applause ) your Eminence, it was a pleasure to be able to speak to you this morning. it is also a great pleasure for me to welcome the winners of the first Charlemagne Youth Prize to the European Parliament today. this prize is awarded jointly by the Foundation of the International Charlemagna Prize of Aachen and the European parliament. (Applopoulou )
057 : ladies and gentlemen, i am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the Japanese Parliament has arrived in the official gallery. they are taking part in the 29th EP/Japan Interparliamentary Meeting that is being held in Brussels and Vienna from 2 to 6 June. (Applause ) pERSON057 :
pERSON073 : Colleagues, i am pleased to inform you that members of a delegation of MPs and other visitors from the State great hural (Parliament ) of Mongolia and the Mission of Mongolia to the European Union have now taken their seats in the distinguished vistors' gallery. it is a great pleasure to welcome them here today.(Applause ) the members of the delegation are in Brussels with their counterparts in the European Parliament on the occasion of the 7th European Union-Mongolia Interparliamentary meeting. this meeting has strengthened the important and growing relationship between the European parliament and the Mongolian Parliament
pERSON110 : madam President, i would like to second the rapporteur. following the debate we had here yesterday, and in view of the Commission's contribution, i consider, therefore, that we need to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House. if amendment 1 is adopted, then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world's poorest people. i ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn. as regards the substance of the report there are no differences of opinion. We agree on the substance, it is only with regard to the
ioc070 : rapporteur. - (Sv ) ( sv ) i have been here long enough to know how pleased the Members of this house will be if i give a two-minute speech. i do not, therefore, intend to do this and will instead merely say that this is an example of how, once again, we are trying to make it easier for citizens to work and establish themselves across borders. this can form a nice little example to use in the election campaigns and i am therefore pleased.
pERSON055 : rapporteur. - (FR ) madam president, let us try to be precise. This report amends our regulation, or rather clarifies it, in order to make it clear how petitions to the Committee on Petitions are received or not received, how information is given to petitioners, and so on. it was approved unanimously, with one vote against i think, in the Committeeon Constitutional Affairs. i do not think, therefore, that this report is very controversial. on the other hand, i am asking the Members of the house to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the
pERSON102 : on behalf of the pPE-DE group. - Madam President, i have two oral amendments to this paragraph. The first is that the words 'human rights and the rule of law' be put in the first place in the points of concern and not the last. Please support this more European position.The second oral amendment concerns the second part of the paragraph, on Russia as a democracy in an undefined future. as there are very sovereign concepts of what democracy means, it would be better to add something. Therefore, my oral amendment is to insert the following after the word 'democracy': 'and refuses
pERSON139 : it is true that we are coming to the final vote - may i say a few personal words of thanks to you for your confidence and for the friendship you have shown me for so long. For the last time in this parliamentary term, i am therefore going to ask you to vote. we shall then go our separate ways. pERSON138 : (FR ) Mr President, pursuant to Article 1 of the code of honour of the European Parliament, on behalf of my group i should like to thank you for the sittings you have chaired. you were one of the best - thank you ( loud applause
pERSON143 : Thank you. ( inaudible ). pERSON142 : (FR ) i too should like to thank you, and i would point out that Article 2 contains the mistake of no longer including you on the list. That is a real shame!(Applause ) perenty
pERSON121 : ladies and gentlemen, i am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament, since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure. (2 ). pERSON129 : yes, please excuse me, it was a slip of the tongue. indeed, the majority was against. it was worth having it checked, but the services had already rectified my mistake. Thus, i am sorry, Mr Nassauer, but the amendment is admissible.- before the vote on paragraph 25, i would like to... pERSON120 : (FR )
pERSON088 : rapporteur. - Mr president, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women's empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda.Yet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU's external policies is still weak. For instance, only eight of the 27 Member Stateshave adopted national action plans on the implementation of UN Security council Resolution 1325.Furthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the council. for this reason, the report stresses that the commission needs to fully implement its commitments in this
(Applause ) : i would also like to say a few political words in order, firstly, to thank all those who have supported me in the drafting of this report - it may seem extremely technical to you, but it is eminently political.it is a question of arithmetic.i should like us to make a technical correction to footnote 2 in paragraph 16 ; the last figure is '2021', not '2022'. (
pERSON134 : i'm pleased to report that... pERSON133 : i can in fact confirm that Amendment 1 is tabled as an addition. pERSON 134 : Mr President, first of all, i would like to make a technical remark. as i understood it, Amendment 1 was not intended to replace the text but, rather, be a complement to it. it was in that sense that I agreed to this amendment. i would also like to thank the entire Commission for their very close cooperation and to point out how important it is that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have close interinstitutional cooperation from the
pERSON092 : our fellow Member, Hans-Peter Martin, has asked to take the floor ; it really must be for a point of order. ( inaudible ). pERSON093 : (DE ) Mr President, i have just one question. if the Irish say 'no' again, how often must they keep going to the polls? a third, fourth, fifth time? that is not democracy, it is a karaoke parliament. i object to that. (
pERSON095 : Mr President, we are in a tricky situation with one of our neighbours when a normally existing republic on the European continent is officially called non-existent - only 'the �former” Republic of m.' - by decision of the un.before washington follows new york and demands that the Georgia in the Caucasus should be called the 'former Soviet Republic of Georgia', we could express our dissatisfaction with such practices and work to find a solution for'm.'. that is my interim proposal - not to replace the name of someone 'former', but to use those five words. i propose to maintain this
pERSON084 : i guarantee that everything possible will be done to return the lifts to working order as soon as possible or to allow colleagues to vote in the lifts. i believe however that Mr Rack has called for the floor on a point of order. that being the case, it would be sensible if, perhaps, we could consider bringing forward declarations such as these. (
(PT ) and, following the amendment that i propose, it will read:'calls on the european union to encourage the creation of an African Partnership Forum engaging all major donors and investors, namely China ;'( pERSON099 : rapporteur. - (PT ) i have realised that the oral amendment to Article 5 which involves a minor alteration to the text.
pERSON008 : thank you very much, Mr Chichester.iu. ( pence ) ( laughter ) (Applause ) ( applause ) pERSON007 : Mr president, i rise as Chair of Parliament's Delegation for relations with Australia and new Zealand to strongly identify myself with the statement you have just made and to thank you for it. i look forward to delivering that message next week in Australia. i emphatically condemn this crime! on behalf of the european parliament, i strongly condemn this abhorrent murder of an innocent man! ladies and gentlemen, last saturday, 13 February 2009, the

(
pERSON083 : rapporteur. - Mr President, it is just to delete the words 'by the first European ombudsman' from the first part of the amendment. ;. pERSON084 : (The oral amendment was accepted )That concludes voting time. before the vote on amendment 7 (paragraph 23 )
pERSON044 : ladies and gentlemen, i have another brief statement to make. 'improving lives'as it states in the proposal for a decision from the committee on foreign affairs. 'on behalf of the silenced voices of 'tibetan ''. (Applause )Hu jia was born on 25 July 1973 inijing and is subject to accusations because of his commitment to the environment, his fight against the dangers of HIV and AIDS and his efforts to ensure that human rights are respected. 'in this proposal, i would like to highlight the extent, the commitment and the success of the collaboration between the European Union
pERSON083 : rapporteur. - (FI) (FI ) the coordinators on the committee on Constitutional Affairs should only relate to a voting procedure, with the vote on a motion for a resolution postponed until the Commission has delivered its opinion and the Council has given its approval. The President of Parliament should officially submit the text of the draft decision agreed by Parliament in the vote to the Commission and Council to examine, pursuant to Article 195 of the EC Treaty. Finally, he should request the Committee on Constitutional affairs to make the necessary contact with the council and the commission and make a proposal to Parliament in good time on how to proceed
pERSON106 : ( s v ) male president, i would like to point out that those who prepared the voting lists were aware of the problem, so that the Member's objection may have been misunderstood. he wanted a vote on paragraph 65, fifth indent. you had a vote for that, but whether family members may be employed. we had no vote on indent 5. we voted separately on indent 4. there has been a change of numbers, it is that simple. we are now going to vote on that. if everyone agrees, so does the president.- before the vote on paragraph 65: no relatives be employed.
pERSON089 : Mr President, very briefly, this is a short amendment to make Amendment 2 to paragraph 38 stronger in its meaning with respect to the rights of the donor. The amendment is to add, after 'donate an organ', the words 'is the exclusive right of the recipient and'.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment ) (Applause)- Before the vote on paragraph 38: (

(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )pERSON098 : rapporteur. -Mr president, there is an oral compromise amendment to replace Amendments 4 and 2. It reads as follows: 'Welcomes the commitment by the Commission to give a monthly report in the Committee in charge on the implementation of the 2006 discharge follow-up, where every month one Commissioner in charge will present the development in his of her area of responsibility, covering national declarations and annual summaries, external actions and implementation ofthe action plan to strengthen the Community's supervisory role under shared management of structural actions ;'.

This is yet another occasion to demand their immediate release on humanitarian grounds.(Applause )Since the state

In particular, the economic crisis which we are in must not be allowed to be used by countries, entrepreneurs or anybody else to drive us back to protectionism, which would be a disaster in the overall context. Consequently, the commission's response is, of course, not only
pERSON215 : (PT ) the scandalous judgment of the European Court of human rights, which orders a cross to be removed from the wall of an Italian school and EUR 5 000 compensation to be paid to one of its pupils for so-called moral damages, has aroused concern not only in the country, but throughout europe as well. i think that public opinion would like to receive an answer to these questions.

pERSON219 : Vice-President of the commission. - (FR ) madam president, honourable Members, i would like first to thank Mr Doorn for his report on the application of the directive on statutory audits of annual accounts. i would now like also to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and more particularly Mrs van den Burg, who has contributed to the production of this report. In the context of the financial crisis, it is essential that all Member States who are currently behind should quickly transpose the directive to achieve the objectives set. i thankMr Doorn and i dare to hope that we will see
pERSON006 : ladies and gentlemen, welcome to you all. i would like to begin with some comments about the situation regarding the plenary chamber in Strasbourg. as you know, due to the partial collapse of the false ceiling in the plennial chamber on 7 August, this first part-session of the euro Parliament in September has had, exceptionally, to be held here in Brussels. i took this decision with a view to ensuring the greatest possible safety of Members and staff, based on my perusal of the initial expert reports and after consultation with the chairpersons of the groups and the french council Presidency. The decision also
ladies and gentlemen, i am afraid i must also inform you about the death of a much-loved former colleague, Maria Luisa Cassanmagnago Cerretti, who died on 4 August. i have particularly vivid memories of her, for she joined the structure of the organisation of the people's party and the great popular movement Solidarność ultimately bore fruit.ladies & gentlemen, during the summer recess, a series of tragic air disasters occurred. on 24 August, another plane crashed shortly after take-off at azerbaijan's capital, bishkek, killing 68

The Republic of south Africa is not only a regional power but also a rising global power and a valued partner who will help us to solve the challenges of the global financial and economic crisis. we firmly believe that we must deepen our dialogue and develop ever closer relations and cooperation. our two regions should act together, not only over efforts to find a way out of the current crisis, but also in the creation of a new global order that will be

However, because of the date, the constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009. That being the case, i ask you, in your

Many thanks.
pERSON500 : i think that all the Members present are ready and willing to debate this matter. i fully understand Mr ouzký's preferences and priorities, and have the utmost respect for them, but at the present time, unless the Rules of Procedure explicitly prevent us from debating the issue, i feel that out of respect for the Commissioner and our fellow Members, we ought to be able to do so. so i suggest we close the sitting. pERSON501 : (FI ) i do not know what secret relations you have with the author of the question, but unfortunately we cannot continue. i am very sorry,

pERSON151 : Mr President, i must say that I am able to accept this argumentation for all amendments with the exception of 15. however, they may be tabled when we deal with the main report. i have to rely on that. pERSON152 : Mrřezina, the answer which i have received - and I have received an e-mail about this specific amendment - was the same as for all these particular amendments. therefore, amendments are inadmissible for this report. They are, however, admissible for the final report. however... pERSON150 : mr. president? pERSON

rapporteur. - (EL ) pERSON068 : i consider it my duty to thank the shadow rapporteurs and everyone who helped to formulate the text we are voting on today. It is a text the basic criterion of which is the protection of individual rights. it is yet another - i would say positive - step in the further development of mutual trust between Member States during their cooperation on criminal matters. it is a step which leads to equality in the eyes of the law between citizens of the Member States, wherever they may be within the territory of the European Union. i should like to ask my fellow members to place their

The text now reads 'whereas the Central European countries had the added experience of Communism'. it would be better to say 'were still taking place in July 1995'. i would not like to delete the truth now. Please agree that 'truth' be inserted: reconciliation with truth and remembrance. please vote for truth. ] pERSON120 : (
pERSON080 : (IT ) Mr President, i appreciate the rapporteur's suggestion, but this resolution contains too many references - not only in this point and in this footnote of the proposed oral amendment, but in many other parts of the resolution. For various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the footnote, relating to the issue of third and fourth wives, which led to doubts over the legitimacy of polygamy. we should nevertheless clarify that, unfortunately, the questionnaire sent to the Member states contained this incorrect terminology. in other words, Member States were asked for

pERSON107 : Mr President, this will be a very short oral amendment, which has been proposed at the request of Alexander milinkevich and the Amnesty International representatives who took part in the conference on Belarus two days ago at Parliament. They asked to extend the demand to release political prisoners who have recently been arrested, one of them at least is the son of the opposition leader, Mr Viačorka. so it is worth mentioning that it is tantamount to state-practised hostage-taking: 'look, be calm in your position because your son is in our army and something may happen to him.' that would
pERSON304 : (FR ) madam President, i ask the Members to allow me to take up a few minutes of their time. i would like to speak on the subject of China. There was a motion for a resolution for today on China, on the case of Mr Gao Zhisheng, a well-known lawyer who is under arrest. There are fears that he will be tortured ; his family has just been allowed entry to the united states and there are fears for his life put in danger. are there any comments?
pERSON109 : thank you, Mr president. there have been a lot of discussions between the groups over the last few days, right down to the last minute in fact. The following amendment now seems to me to be the one that has the broadest agreement in this House and also seems to be, according to direct information which i have received, was voted on with the agreement of both Croatia and Slovenia.The amendment reads as follows in English:'Recalls the informal agreement reached on 26 August 2007 by the Prime Ministers of Croatia and Sloven Slovenia on the submission of their border dispute to an international body ; welcomes the readiness of Croatia
105 : on behalf of the pPE-DE group. - Mr President, paragraph 7 - the final paragraph - instructs you to forward this resolution to the Commission, the council and those other illustrious bodies but, including the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and social Committee, and the social partners but, unusually, does not instruct you to send it to the parliaments of Member States. so i would like to repair that omission and propose the very simple oral amendment: 'and the parements of the Member States'.

Hence we propose the following recital, which i shall read in English:'having regard to the Zaradaza Charter of2008 ‘ a new Comprehensive vision of water” and the recommendations of the Water Tribune adopted on 14September 2008, the closing day

That is not a fair procedure. however, with regard to what Mrs ibrisagic has just said, i would try to say that we are able to accept this wording. i would then also withdraw
pERSON118 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, after yesterday's debate and after consultation with the rapporteur, i would like to add one word to the amendment. The word would then read as follows: 'except for temporary, transitional derogations'. 'transitional'.

Knowing their contents as i do, i take it for granted that the statements made just now by the rapporteur will not have the support of some Members, but, as you know, i think this constitutes a point of order. i will not enter into a debate. i am therefore unable to give the floor and re-open the debate ; i am unable to take responsibility for raising this matter again in the Bureau, even though

This is a very sensitive topic, and i would like to avoid the same thing happening as with the subject of alcohol, on which Parliament did not give an opinion. - (

pERSON133 : - (FR ) i apologise, but no debate on voting of this type is permitted ; i gave you the floor for one minute to illustrate the request, but you have spoken for longer, and we cannot open a debate.(The request for referral back to committee was rejected ) it is clear, and this is my last point, (The President cut off the speaker )
(Heckling ). # pERSON147 : Mr Rack, i am pleased to be able to answer you in real time, because the administrative services tell me that the indications of those who have signed amendments received jointly from the political groups are transcribed in the voting list exactly in the order of signing indicated by the groups. in this case, therefore, there is no discretion in the application of alphabetical order.
pERSON140 : it seems to me that the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs lulling, is clear, regardless of whether it is shared. We will move on to a roll-call vote on the entire proposal, as amended. please excuse me, everyone. pERSON141 : (PT ) i want to protest about the statement made by Mrs Lulling who is trying to condition the vote of Members in this house. This does not make sense.The interpretation being given is one that we do not share. it is only in this sense that i would ask Members, who know what this is about, who

pERSON142 : - (FR ) Mrs Wallis, i find it extremely regrettable that you have given the floor to Mr daul and Mr Schulz, but not to me. it is true that you testified in a report that you were the expert in interpreting the one-rule-for-one-and-one...rule- for-another Rules of Procedure. all i wish to say is that i completely agree with Mr schulz and that what we have heard today, in this House, is uncalled for.(Applause ) ( laughter ). pERSON140: - ( FR ) please, show
pERSON101 : Mr Guardans Cambó, we will take this as a test case. i have to ask those who proposed the amendment if they are in agreement with your addition. the answer is 'yes'. (The oral amendment was accepted )-before the vote on Amendment 2: ) pERSON104 : - Madam President, i have an oral amendment here to Amendment 2, namely the deletion of the last sentence for the sake of accuracy, because it is not accurate any more. we would delete the sentence 'Considers that this monitoring should start after the adoption of each interim EPA'. This does not apply in this
pERSON119 : - - The feeling is that the amendment with the addition covers the whole of the text. if you really want to vote on the original text, we can go back, but the general mood seems to be to carry on, i think. i think it is covered. indeed. pERSON120 : - Madam President, i am quite happy to carryon. i mean it is completely covered. i really think. pERSON121 : - We will therefore keep going.
pERSON114 : - (FR ) madam President, in paragraph 39, compromise amendment 19 would be acceptable to our group if, in relation to the non-state actors, we could add 'the participation'. This would give the following amendment: '39a.stresses in particular the crucial role of ACP parliaments and the participation of non- state actors in the monitoring and management of EPAs'; the rest would remain unchanged. i believe that the rapporteur, Mr Ford, is in agreement. thank you. pERSON111 : -(FR ) i agree to this procedure. i will vote against.

We will in fact get to where you would like to be by following the voting list and voting on the amendments. rapporteur. - (RO ) Parliament reached an agreement with the council and this agreement is supported by five political groups. i am referring to the two reports which follow. thanks to the amendments submitted by two of our fellow Members - incidentally, the content of these amendments has already been included in the compromise agreed with the Council -, we must vote today on a number of articles.Rules which i regard as incorrect have meant that the order of vote includes in
pERSON128 : - (DE ) - thank you sir markov. in fact i had to inform the house that there is a corrigendum to all language versions of this report deleting the reference to Rule 47. i want to thank the commission for their cooperation, and ask Members to vote for assent. i should like this to be recorded in the minutes.1 - (
pERSON072 : (PL ) Mr president, i want to congratulate not only the rapporteurs, but also the commission on its initiative in preparing this text reviewing the first ten years of economic and Monetary union, which is 10 years old. is a fine anniversary, and also an occasion to consider how the EU and the global economic, financial and political situation has changed and whether the Maastricht criteria suit current global changes. on behalf of the pERSON073 : (0065 ) pERSON0ERSON074 : (es ) Mr President, - (FR ) Mr Juncker, i would like
pERSON125 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, i would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work. it was not easy: they have worked miracles and they have my respect.- after the vote: i thank the honourable members of the european parliament. i thank them for that. afterthe vote: thank you and congratulations. pERSON125 ( on camera ) :Member of the commission. -Mr president, i ask for your support to ensure that we have confident, well-informed consumers for electronic communications, who are also secure and know that their personal data is protected. i am
pERSON006 : it is with great sadness that we have learned of the dramatic events in Kauhajoki in the west of Finland, where 11 people have lost their lives in a very tragic incident at a school. a number of people were also seriously injured by the perpetrator, who then turned his gun on himself. on behalf of the European Parliament, i would like to express our deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families. all the relatives of the victims. person006 : as responsible politicians in Europe and in all the Member States, we must do our utmost to ensure that such acts of violence are detected and
(Applause ) thank you. ) pERSON137 : Mr Cohn- bendit has indeed spoken. before the vote on paragraph 25: 'pERSON134 : (IT ) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i have an oral amendment at the beginning of paragraph 25. i wish to add the following words: 'condemns every act of violence against Christian communities and', and then the original text follows. The reason is that nowhere in the document is there any explicit condemnation of what happened in Orissa ; much weaker synonyms are used instead.(The oral amendment was rejected and some Members chanted the slogan 'Europe
before the vote on Amendment 138: ( inaudible ) pERSON100 : rapporteur. - (FR ) Mr president, we have a relatively difficult decision with regard to Amendment 138, for which three requests for a split vote have been tabled. i personally tabled an oral amendment to the first part of the amendment, which is included on the voting list and reads: 'applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end-users'. that is the first oral amendment. since then, we have been looking for a solution acceptable to the political groups in relation to the third part
109 : rapporteur. - (ES ) pERSON109 : i am not going to speak for long as i am aware that we are subject to time pressures. However, i want to thank everyone who took part in this report and underline one very important point: what Parliament is offering today in relation to the legislative review of the electronic communications sector, as already stated by Catherine Trautmann, is wholly consistent and, we believe, will be very positive in terms of developing this market. The negotiations now beginning must reach their conclusion within this parliamentary term. i believe that this is therefore decisive for the sector.
pERSON021 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE group. - male president, in the debate that we are going to have - i hope - we will be asking for an independent inquiry into the mass graves, for those sites to be protected and for an end to the harassment of the people carrying out this inquiry. i think there is absolutely no contradiction between this request for an urgent debate on the issue and the hearing that Mrs flautre is organising for 16 July. therefore... pERSON022 : (DE ) Mr President, how can a roll-call vote be requested on a motion i have tabled, when
pERSON076 : ( sarcastically )! pERSON077 : on behalf of the - ( tongue-in-cheek ) pERSON081 : madam president, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to say that i have enormous respect for Mrs haug, who was passionate in her presentation of a comprehensive, demanding and, at the same time, very brave budgetary report, which was voted through unanimously in the committee on transport and tourism. - ( helicarrier ) - (DE ) madam. pERSON095 : (SK ) my thanks go toMrs haug. they also apply, in
ladies and gentlemen, i should like to welcome the french Minister of State for European Affairs and representative of the new Presidency, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, most warmly to this house. This is the first time that the representative of a government has been present right at the start of our work. the euro Parliament is delighted for Mrs Betancourt and all the others who were released, and for their families. the release means the end of a very harrowing time and is a reminder that we must never give up hope. i spoke to president uribe last week and congratulated his government and army and the Colombian people on this successful
pERSON254 : President-in-Office. - (FR ) pERSON255 : thank you very much, Minister. Mr Jouyet and i shall now sign the Galileo Regulation, and i would like to ask Commissioner ferrero-waldner, Angelika niebler, chairman of the committee on Industry, research and energy, and etelka barsi-pataky, the rapporteur, to step forward and join us.(Applause ) i should like to - (
pERSON107 : on behalf of the IND/DEM group. - (DA ) - (DE ) i should like to briefly state the reasons for my oral amendment, and it actually concerns both Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen, who gave the size of Parliament as an argument for this change. i think this report, in the state that it now stands, is illegal because it was voted against in its original form in committee. The amended version now before the house bears such little resemblance to the original one, which was defeated in committee, so i think that, if we duly follow our own procedures, we have no option
i should like in particular to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and energy for their cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr swoboda, Mr unseppänen, and obviously Commissioner Piebalgs - i hope i have not left anyone out - i believe that in our work, we have tried not to penalise producers or consumers but have tried - and thank you for the applause, but i shall press on - we lose so much time in this house! - please may i speak for three seconds. this, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the limited time available yesterday, i
090 : rapporteur. - (DE ) pERSON090 : ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a very few remarks on this report, one aspect of which, as you know, is that it contributes to the process of deregulation and the reduction of red tape. we in Parliament, however, can play a far more prominent role in this process.
333 : i would therefore like to extend a welcome to our guests, to this the twelfth European Parliament/ Parliament of south Africa interparliamentary meeting. this is a very important visit. the frequency of these visits is enhancing political dialogue, which is a vital element of the joint action plan, which we adopted in May last year, for the implementation of the European Union/South Africa Strategic Partnership.Heightening our cooperation with a view to increasing international security and stability is without a doubt more necessary now than ever before, in view of the current tense regional situation in southern Africa and, especially, the crisis in Zimbabwe with which
pERSON161 : on behalf of the pPE-DE group. - (EL ) madam president, it is obvious from this debate that there is still some way to go where this matter is concerned. these issues obviously ought to have been debated in committee. that is why, in compliance with our Rules of Procedure, i am pleased to ask you to refer this report back to the committee.(The request for referral to committee was rejected ) after the vote on the legislative resolution was passed ) pERSON165 : (FR ) one sometimes has to put one's spectacles on to see if there is an MEP requesting, in
i wish to repeat, 'we have united for the better'. we have cause to be pleased and thankful. now we must turn to a rather worrying fact: i wish to express our profound concern regarding the tragic situation facing the US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, who has been sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the US, and is currently being held in the Evin prison in Tehran. On behalf of all of us, i would like to add that, in essence, the sentencing of Roxana saberi comes at a critical moment : two months before the presidential elections in Iran, and
pERSON098 : ladies and gentlemen, i am delighted to be able to inform you that a delegation from Australia's house of Representatives and senate has taken its place in the public gallery. i wish a very warm welcome to you all.(Applause ) it is taking part in the 31st EP-Australia interparliamentary meeting, which is being held here in the European Parliament on 9 and 10 April. pERSON097 : the european parliament and the australian parliament began their direct and wide-ranging political dialogue in 1981. we very much look forward to strengthening and expanding this cooperation even further.
pERSON997 : Rapporteur. - (FI ) Mr president, the voting list also has Amendment 8 replaced with Amendment 14. The intention is not to replace it but for the last part, which starts 'in addition to the short-term development costs', to be included in this report. ( unintelligible ) pERSON107 : i have just been told that is not the case. Shall we vote on Amendment 14, then? i have been told by Paul Dunstan, who really is an expert on all these points of detail, that that is just possible. he recommends that we simply take the vote now.-
pERSON102 : Mr President, cancer may cause chronic illness and can possibly lead to disability therefore in order to make new paragraph 34a more accurate and more credible i propose an oral amendment to include the words'may include' and 'possibly' in the appropriate areas in that subparagraph.(The oral amendment was accepted )
pERSON088 : (DE ) Mr President, i would like to say that if this oral amendment were adopted, my group would vote in favour of Mr Swoboda's motion instead of against. ( ) pERSON089 : you will not know until after the vote, though, whether it has been accepted or not.(The oral amendment was accepted ) : time has moved on, so it needs to be put in the past tense.- before the vote on amendment 15. pERSON085 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr president, it is simply a matter of replacing the word 'envisages' with '
pERSON094 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE group. - (DE ) Mr Cohn-bendit, this is laughable! everyone knows that we cannot find a solution within a week. this row has been going on for years, and the decision has to be taken: Macedonia is called Macedonia is calling Macedonia. Greece has to accept that and then we will take a vote. it will make no difference whether we do so today or leave it for a week ; Macedonia will still be called Macedonia.(Applause ). pERSON095 : rapporteur. - (NL ) vs. natl.
pERSON155 : - (NL ) Mr president, i think we can agree, however unwillingly, that the displays are not working. it is scandalous not to be able to see the results in the European Parliament. in these circumstances i would ask that when you check the voting on Amendment 49, it was 474 in favour, 181 against, and you said, 'Approved, as i said'. however, you had not said 'approved': you had called it'rejected'. if you say so.... pERSON165 : now then, since the large screen is not working, i will read
172 : Mr President, in view of yesterday's appalling terrorist attack in Kabul, and on the basis of today's discussion, i should like to propose as an oral amendment that a new section 3a be inserted as follows: 'condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack against the Indian Embassy in Kabul on 7 July 2008, which caused more than 40 deaths, including those of four members of Embassy staff ; expresses its sincerest sympathy for the relatives, the wounded and the Afghan and Indian Governments'.(Applause)(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )President. - voting is closed.
143 : Member of the commission. - Mr president, the commission thanks Mr Duff for his report. we support Parliament's decision to reform the hearing procedure in a way that will further increase the transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the appointment procedure by establishing clear, transparent and uniform procedures and evaluation criteria. however, the Commission considers that the procedures to be applied in the different cases covered by the report have to fully respect the relevant provisions of the Treaties, notably Article 215, and of the Framework Agreement, so as to reflect the legal and institutional differences between them.Specifically the procedures applied for portfolio reshuffles should be lighter than those
pERSON127 : on behalf of the pERSON130 : (DE ) male president, in my opinion, Mr Coelho has just provided a very clear and objective picture of the situation. i am all in favour of having a common database of all the necessary tools to fight terrorism and cross-border crime. it is a fact that data protection is essential but in the fight against terrorism and international crime it is secondary. not only am i.pERSON129 : male president, there are 4.3 million individuals whose DNA is on the UK national DNA database and available to police. That is 7% of the UK population
pERSON141 : on behalf of the pERSON149 : (PL ) Mr President, i thank the Commissioner for coming and presenting the latest position of the Commission on visa issues for the Ukraine and Belarus. - ( pl ) - pERSON140 : - ( tongue-in-cheek ). pERSON146 : ( PL ) Mr president, the youth of Belarus is often punished by the withdrawal of the right to education for holding beliefs not liked by the authorities. Poland provides higher education places for many of these young people. we must not waste this by imposing an economic blockade on such young people who want to enter our country
pERSON331 : (? ) pERSON322 : (EL ) the commission. - the second part, i believe that first of all we need to emphasise that it is not the commission's job to interpret Court of justice rulings. They affect, above all, the middle class. they affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment. Therefore, we must be careful ourselves and make sure that we use our trade defence instruments they are for the purposes for which they are intended and not as protectionist measures? pERSON325 : thank you very much. maybe the Commissioner would comment on the situation of the German Government on this matter
pERSON084 : rapporteur. - (EL ) meritor. as the debate was not held for technical reasons, i think that we have done a good job. with intensive negotiations with the Council and the Commission, i believe that we achieved a good compromise at first reading. With the contribution made by the European Parliament, we have accelerated the application of the directive by one year, broadened the scope to service stations in residential areas, strengthened information and control mechanisms for service stations and information mechanisms for citizens. this is a change, the change of which will improve the quality of the atmosphere and will considerably limit the greenhouse gases
pERSON088 : Member of the commission. - Mr President, the Commission takes note of the decision of Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman's report until the next parliamentary term. While fully respecting Parliament's decision, the Commission is not convinced that the vote closing Parliament's first reading would tie the hands of the next Parliament. Therefore, the commission will reconsider its proposal only after the two branches of legislative authority have adopted their positions, but intends to continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with both institutions in the mean time and confirms its willingness to seek a compromise with Parliament and the Council. (Applause
pERSON110 : i would like to say a special word of thanks to Paul Dunstan to my left, who has done his job so splendidly over the years.( loud applause ) Paul, i 'd like to tell you, together we have made few mistakes - sometimes i have made them, sometimes you. however, we were an unbeatable team.
pERSON105 : thank you very much, Mr Parish. i would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very willing to work with me on what is an incredibly technical and difficult dossier. if supported, will ensure that ethical decisions on this issue are made by Member States themselves and not by the Commission. i urge Members of the house to support this report.
pERSON077 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i just want to briefly explain that this report includes the amendments unanimously adopted by the committee on the Environment, Public health and food safety and producers of poultrymeat in the European Union. i therefore want to thank all those who worked with me on this report, including the members and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the environment, Public Health and Food safety.we hope that the European Commission and the council will take account of this report and the opinionful resolution adopted in this plenary on 19 June 2008, which rejected the Commission proposal aimed at authorising the
pERSON099 : (DE ) Mr President, i would like to ask you which article of the Rules of Procedure allows you to correct their voting lists here with your consent? this is an abuse of the parliamentary independence of individual Members! in the final vote on both the amended proposal and the legislative resolution, it should say 'free votes'. i ask you - and i include the Group here - to bear this in mind. - your consent. pERSON090 : (
pERSON096 : Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission takes note of the position expressed today by the European Parliament and, in view of the commitments made before this house, the Commission will draw the most appropriate conclusions from today's negative vote, also taking into account the Council's position.The Commission will consider the best way to achieve the required result, in other words to guarantee the social protection of workers while at the same time avoiding an increase in administrative burdens in the road transport sector. pERSON097 : without further ado, i would like to
pERSON010 : you would need to put that question to the Independence and Democracy Group, of course, but i can assure you that the President of Parliament will support absolute transparency in this matter. thank you very much. pERSON009 : (DE ) Mr President, is there a minimum period for serving on a committee, or is this just intended for today? pERSON012 : you have not answered the question as to how long you intend to serve on this committee, but my Austrian colleague, i was in fact a member of the Committee on International trade for the first two and a half years of this parliamentary term. i
