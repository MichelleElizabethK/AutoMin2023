"transcript": "PERSON081 : Mr President, I rise under Rule 173, regarding Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure. I quote: 'Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently'. At the debate on the Council and Commission statements this morning, you, Mr President, said that Mr Farage's remarks were unacceptable. As a new Member of this House, I would like you to clarify, with respect to Rule 2, whether a Member of this House is free to express his or her opinions without any censorship.\nPERSON082 : With your permission, I will have a meeting with Mr Farage and we shall have a friendly talk about it. That is what I propose. Thank you very much.\nPERSON083 : (DE) Mr President, I also took part in the debate this morning. I did not have the impression that you were unfair or abused your office in any way. On the contrary...(Uproar)I would like to say, on the contrary, that you listened with great patience and respect as the chairman of this so-called group demonstrated to us that he is a professional slanderer. That was the reality of Mr Farage's speech.(Applause)\nPERSON084 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to request a roll-call vote on the discharge of the Council's budget 2007. I think that it is important that the Council can see the broad support from this Parliament behind our demands to the Council on more cooperation with Parliament and its competent committees on the next discharge procedure."

"transcript": "PERSON096 : Mr President, on the voting order between Amendments 43 and 54, my group sees that this voting order in this list is the wrong way round.Adopting Amendment 43 should not make Amendment 54 fall, because in 54 there are also other issues which are not covered by 43.If some of this makes another amendment fall, then 54 should be voted on first and then 43 after that.This is not on the first vote but a vote on the second page. I just wanted to announce this so that you know when we come to that place in the vote.\nPERSON097 : Would a representative of the Committee like to say something about this? Perhaps Mr Leinen? Are you proposing a change to the voting order? I have to say we were not expecting this change. No such proposal has been made.\nPERSON098 : Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, yes, Mrs Hassi is right. We can follow the procedure that she has proposed.\nPERSON100 : (DE) Mr President, just now the interpreter asked for Article 20 and not for Article 22 which makes it difficult to do what you intend. Therefore, I hope that the interpreters now translate the Polish numbers correctly.\nPERSON101 : Maybe it was my fault. I am sorry.\nPERSON102 : (DE) Mr President, an official delegation is representing Parliament in Copenhagen. You will also be attending and, for the first time, we do not have to rent an office in the city. Instead, we will have an official presence in the EU pavilion. This is good and we are grateful. Therefore, Article 61 is not needed.The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject.(Applause)\nPERSON103 : Mr President, I have taken the message on board and I will pass it on to the Commission President and the other commissioners.\nPERSON104 : Mr President, I would like to ask you very kindly to speed up a bit because, if we continue at this pace, we will end up voting in plenary at midnight."

"transcript": "PERSON091 : (FR) Mr President, my machine is not working, but that is not the main thing that I wanted to say.This report, Mr President, included an amendment that has been withdrawn, Amendment 86. My point of order is based on Rule 24(2) of our Rules of Procedure. As I have had the honour of explaining to you on behalf of a number of my colleagues, this Rule provides for the non-attached Members to appoint one of their own as a delegate to the Conference of Presidents. Following the blocking by the administration, this obligation has not been met since July.However, it was envisaged, under this Amendment 86, that this provision would be changed in order to let you decide which of the representatives of the non-attached Members should sit in the Conference of Presidents. This, Mr President, is a real disgrace, and I choose my words carefully. It is seen as such by all our colleagues. It would seem that we are the only ones to have the appointment of our representative to the Conference of Presidents imposed on us.I hope, Mr President, that you will be intent on refusing this option afforded to you by the Socialist Group and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to which you belong.\nPERSON092 : I understand what you are saying. Would the rapporteur like to say something about this? May I ask the rapporteur to comment?\nPERSON093 : rapporteur. - Mr President, we do not have to spend a lot of time on this because the Non-Inscrits are not worth spending a lot of time on. We are not voting on this. If they bothered to turn up at the committees to which they are entitled to turn up, they would know that we are not voting on this today but we are going to vote on this in January. I will be sticking to my recommendation that you, Mr President, invite a Non-Inscrit to attend the Conference of Presidents."

"transcript": "PERSON106 : (DE) Mr President, what Mr Ferber rightly complained about has happened again. We have heard three different numbers relating to the paragraph that we are just about to vote on. I do not know whether this is because the numbers were not read out correctly or were not translated correctly. I heard 33, then 30 and then 43, making it very unclear.\nPERSON107 : (FR) Mr President, I can assure you that the speed of the vote is perfect. You are a very polite man and we are very grateful to you for that, but we could make even faster progress if you did not say 'thank you' after every vote, but only at the end of the vote!Thank you, Mr President!\nPERSON108 : Thank you for that remark!\nPERSON110 : (IT) Mr President, the subject is an oral amendment to paragraph 131, on which I am in agreement with the other two rapporteurs, Mr L\u00f3pez Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer.The current text states: 'calls on the Council, the Commission and Member States to evaluate and review current international, European and national laws and policies on drugs and to promote harm reduction policies, notably with a view to the conferences on those issues held at UN level'.The oral amendment proposes inserting the words 'prevention' and 'recovery', meaning that the call to evaluate and review laws would concern 'harm reduction, prevention and recovery policies'."

"transcript": "PERSON255 : We have before us an important event, because in a moment, Mrs Torstensson and I will sign some very important documents related to the 'Telecom' package. Mrs Torstensson, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, the legal acts which constitute the 'Telecom' package were enacted in a codecision procedure. Electronic communication and the internet have become the main tools of our modern societies. This legislative package is a good example of how our work can help people and how it can affect their everyday lives.In particular, we have the revised framework directive for electronic communications networks and services. Its rapporteur was our fellow Member, Mrs Trautmann, who is with us today. The directive was adopted at third reading, which shows how much work was required so that we could achieve the best deal for our citizens. The elements of this directive which remain are a more efficient and, to a greater degree, strategic management of radio frequencies, greater competition and easier investment in the internet in the future.The directive on universal services and users' rights, whose rapporteur was our fellow Member Mr Harbour, also represents an important step towards offering better services. We wanted to improve consumers' rights, protect privacy and personal data, and also to make it easier for every citizen to keep the same mobile telephone number when changing operator, and that this should not take longer than one working day.Finally, in order to bring these principles into being in a better and more cohesive fashion, Parliament and the Council decided to establish a European organisation bringing together 27 national operators. The rapporteur for Parliament on this matter was Mrs del Castillo Vera.I would like, therefore, to express great esteem for the rapporteurs, of course, who are always key people. I would also like to thank all those whose hard work on these directives has contributed to today's success. The effort of many people combined to produce this success. In particular, it was successive presidencies, and principally the Czech Presidency and the current Swedish Presidency, as they were responsible for the second and third readings.I would like most of all, at this particular moment, to thank the Commissioner and the European Commission very much for preparing this package, which was not the only good result produced during the last five-year term of office. We would like to offer our congratulations. Your cooperation is of great help to us, and it also affects the way the citizens perceive what we do.Of course, the three rapporteurs are most deserving of credit, as also is the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, our fellow Member Mr Reul, and Vice-President of Parliament, Mr Vidal-Quadras, who chaired the EP delegation to the Conciliation Committee. So it was quite a group of people who contributed to today's success.I would like, speaking from this seat and on behalf of all of us, fellow Members of the European Parliament but, above all, citizens of the European Union, to express great respect and esteem, because this is the best example of how we can do something which the citizens will perceive as a great success, something which will make their lives easier. I congratulate you all.\nPERSON256 : Mr President, I would like to start by emphasising how pleased I am that we are able to sign the telecoms package together today. The package strengthens competition and the protection of consumers in Europe. We will have modern and up-to-date regulations in an area where development is very rapid.I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all of those involved for their incredibly solid and constructive work and very creative cooperation. I would like to extend a special thank you to the European Parliament's Vice-President, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the Committee Chairman, Herbert Reul, and the three rapporteurs from Parliament, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo Vera and Malcolm Harbour, who, like my colleagues in the Council, have done some extremely important work to enable us to put the telecoms package together.This cooperation meant that we succeeded in reaching an agreement that clearly indicates the major and crucial importance of the internet for the freedom of expression and the freedom of information, and in so doing, we have not contravened the treaty.The telecoms package is a major victory for all consumers in Europe. Once again, I would like to thank everyone for the work that has been put in to achieve this agreement."

"transcript": "PERSON149 : Under the codecision procedure, legislative acts are signed by the President of the European Parliament and the current Presidency representing the Council. Before resuming the sitting, a legislative package will be signed to make it effective. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Minister for European Affairs, will sign on behalf of the Council. I am very pleased that Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is also with us today.I would like to say a few words on the legislation we are about to sign today. Today, the eve of the extraordinary summit of the European Union in preparation for the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is a good occasion to strengthen the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator. I have been asked to represent the European Parliament at the dinner of Heads of State or Government. We, the European Union, will be preparing for our participation in the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.Today we have an important package of four different legislative acts under the codecision procedure approved by us in response to the financial crisis. What is in the package? A capital requirements directive, a regulation on credit rating agencies, a new regulation on cross-border payments, and a decision establishing a new programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and audit.The directive and the regulations are aimed at protecting EU investors and the European Union's financial system, and at increasing consumer rights guarantees and ensuring better supervision. These acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets. We are thereby fulfilling the predictions, but the legislation we are signing was drawn up by Parliament in the previous term. Would Minister Malmstr\u00f6m like to take the floor before signing the legislative acts?\nPERSON150 : Mr President, we are now going to sign a number of legal acts that are absolutely central to the EU's response to the financial and economic crisis that has hit Europe so hard and that will continue to have an impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency, which worked very hard to get these acts in place within a short time. It was thanks to the Czech Presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament, as well as quick, effective agreements.As I mentioned previously, we are cautiously optimistic about the economic situation, but we also know that unemployment will hit many countries very hard in the coming period. There is therefore still reason for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work closely with each other. I am looking forward to our cooperation and I am proud to be able to sign these acts along with you, Mr President.\nPERSON151 : I would like to draw attention to the fact that what we are doing is an expression of the continuity of the functions of the Council, Parliament and the Commission. There have, in the meantime, been elections to the European Parliament which have in no way impeded our activities or our work.I would like to now ask Minister Malmstr\u00f6m to proceed with the joint signing, which will be done at this table. I also invite Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mrs Bowles - the previous and current Commissioners on Economic and Monetary Affairs - I would ask both of you to come here to the middle, and the rapporteurs, who include Mr Karas and Mr Gauz\u00e8s. You will all be present at the signing, and the Minister and I will sign.I would also like to point out that Mrs Starkevi\u010di\u016btand Mr Hoppenstedt are former rapporteurs, but are no longer in the European Parliament, as they were Members during the previous term of office.We shall now proceed to the signing."

"transcript": "PERSON096 : (FR) Mr President ...(The speaker was interrupted by heckling from the right)Are you ill or something? Are you ill?As there were problems with the vote yesterday, I would ask you to check the machines.It is not such a bad idea, is it, ladies and gentlemen?\nPERSON097 : As proposed, we are carrying out a trial vote, i.e. a vote to check that we all have cards, we are all seated properly and that the equipment is working.Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat: once every five years the European Parliament decides who will lead another European Union institution. Today's agenda includes electing the President of the European Commission. This election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution. It is we, the elected representatives of all European regions, who will do this.The Council of Europe has nominated Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission. In accordance with Rule 105(2) of the Rules of Procedure, Parliament may approve or reject the nominated candidate by a majority vote. The ballot is secret. Let us now proceed to elect the President of the Commission in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. The vote will be held using the electronic system. I would like to repeat that you can vote from any position in the plenary hall as long as you place your voting card into the personal voting device. I say this because there are many new MEPs in the House. As usual, in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate, or abstain.(The vote is held)Here are the results of the vote: 718 Members voted, 382 in favour, 219 against and 117 abstentions.(Loud applause)\nPERSON098 : According to the results we will see on the board - they are not visible yet - the Council's nominee, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has been elected President of the European Commission.I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the president-elect on being voted to the position of President of the Commission. I would like to say that we have plenty of work ahead of us. We will have to face challenges, and our citizens expect us to act very energetically and to live up to their expectations.Mr President, I know that you are aware of the priorities of the European Parliament. Following the discussions, which we also held within our political groups, like yesterday, you know our expectations. For that reason, we greatly look forward to working with you over the coming five years. We expect above all to be able to respond to our citizens' needs. I congratulate you once again, and you may now take the floor, if you would like to say a few words to us. Congratulations, and all the best!(Loud applause)\nPERSON099 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks for the great confidence you have shown in me. I am hugely honoured and very moved by your confidence, and I take it with a great sense of responsibility. I also take this vote of confidence as a sign that this Parliament agrees with the ambitious agenda that I am presenting for Europe over the next five years.As I said during the discussions before the vote, I would like to work with all the political groups that sign up to this project, which aspires to a Europe of solidarity and freedom. I must, however, give special thanks to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which ran the risk of endorsing my programme in Warsaw before the elections, in an attempt right from the outset to give greater expression to European parliamentary democracy.As I said in this Chamber yesterday and at other times recently, as President of the Commission, my party will be Europe and it will be made up of all those who want to come on this exciting journey to make a united Europe. These are the people with whom I would like to form the consensus that we need to enhance the European project.Please also allow me on this occasion to say a few words to my own country, Portugal. Without the initiative and support of its Government and Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, I could not have stood for election. I would like to thank Portugal for its support, which was also passed on to me by the President of the Republic, Professor Cavaco Silva. I would like to acknowledge the support of every single one of those ardent Europeans who believe in this project for Europe.Finally, I would like to reiterate to you, Mr President, and to all Members of this House, my sincere determination to work closely with you during the next five years so that you can build a stronger European parliamentary democracy. I believe that the European Parliament and the European Commission, as typical Community institutions, have a special duty towards our citizens. That is exactly what I have said I will do and that is exactly what I am going to do - a stronger Europe for freedom and solidarity.(Applause)\nPERSON101 : I have an official statement. Under Rule 105(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I shall inform the Council of our results of 10 minutes ago, and would like to ask the Council and the newly-elected President of the Commission to propose jointly the nominees for the posts of Commissioners. In view of the amount of work ahead of us, we should work as quickly as possible.This was the official statement related to the election of Mr Barroso as President of the European Commission."

"transcript": "PERSON068 : Mr President, we have not been able to hold a debate in plenary on this very important report, which is why we feel it is necessary, on behalf of the Committee, to take the floor before you today.We have all worked together, and I commend the outstanding work of the shadow rapporteurs. We visited no fewer than 26 detention centres in 10 EU Member States, and we noted several key points. We observed, in certain centres, an obvious state of decay and an obvious lack of hygiene, and we denounced the failure to respect human dignity. We found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children's right to education was not always respected.We call for respect for clear, fair, effective and proportionate asylum procedures, and we call for the implementation of a permanent system of visits and inspections of detention centres. We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres - something that these kinds of visits permit - and we must do so in order to take action so that things change.The press has asked me why we did not cite any countries in this summary report. I replied that it was my choice, that it was our choice, since we have a collective responsibility with regard to what goes on in detention centres in Europe, and the purpose of this report is not to rank the Member States.We will not stop calling for European solidarity in the area of asylum. We cannot leave the Member States, at Europe's borders, on their own to face large migratory flows. I repeat once again: we have a collective responsibility.(Applause)\nPERSON069 : Many thanks, Mrs Roure. I can see that even the top jurists here in plenary, or those who see themselves as such, are unaware that the rapporteur is entitled to make a two-minute statement when a report has not been discussed in plenary. Therefore, Mrs Roure has this right, which she has exercised, and everyone should accept this as it is laid down in our Rules of Procedure.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON072 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse me and accept my thanks for your patience.As we know, the European Parliament has wished for many years to express its views on small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent 99% of all European companies and 75 million jobs, while today only 3% of these SMEs access the foreign, external market and only 8% access the internal market.We are therefore asking the Council and the Commission to take account of these facts in multilateral and bilateral negotiations, in access to external markets, in the fight against counterfeiting, in the use of trade protection instruments and in competitive tendering. Trade is the key to greater prosperity.I would like to thank my colleagues at the Committee on International Trade and, most of all, the shadow rapporteurs of the two largest groups, Mrs Sa\u00effi and Mrs Locatelli, and offer my heartfelt thanks to the secretariat and to Dr Bendini in particular. I believe that after all our work, we are today handing shared thoughts and proposals to the Commission, on a topic close to Mrs Ashton's heart, as we heard from her opening speech as Commissioner, and one that must be tackled without delay if we want to resolve, at least in part, the serious economic and financial crisis that is haunting our workers and citizens."

"transcript": "PERSON078 : Mr President, we found that it would not be fair to mention just one of the parties, so we would like to take out the reference to the Kosovo authorities.

"transcript": "PERSON082 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to move an oral amendment in the form of an addition to paragraph 64a. That addition reads as follows: 'where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO'.So the last part of paragraph 64a will read as follows: 'supports Taiwan's participation as an observer in relevant international organisations where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO;'.I would ask colleagues not to oppose this oral amendment, because it is important for the Socialists to give their support to this resolution, and broad support is very important in order to send a strong signal to the Commission and to China."

"transcript": "PERSON242 : I am here at this meeting but, as a result of an agreement made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I will not participate in the vote. However, I am here.\nPERSON243 : author. - Madam President, I am asking for a last-minute change to the wording of the oral amendment - if the House will allow - because we have now managed to establish what the confusion was in the joint resolution.The wording originally said 'non-fire period', and that did not make any sense to us, so we changed it to 'cease-fire'. It now transpires that the official text from the Declaration of the Co-Chairs, which includes the European Union, uses the wording - which is strange, but nevertheless they use it in writing - 'no-fire' period. So, could we change the 'non-fire' to 'no-fire' rather than the word 'cease-fire', as this would reflect the official text of the Co-Chairs?\nPERSON244 : Madam President, I think there is something else further down the line and I think Mr Tannock should tell us about that as well before we vote. There is another small change.\nPERSON245 : author. - Madam President, including the word 'humanitarian' aid, which is just to make it clear what kind of aid we are talking about.But the important thing is to declare a 'no-fire period', which is the wording in the Co-Chairs' declaration.\nPERSON246 : author. - (ES) Yes, there is something, but I do not know if this is a misunderstanding or not. In theory, the version that we have from the oral amendment is that the text should read 'cease-fire', not 'non-fire'. Is this right or have I misunderstood?The text should read 'cease-fire'.\nPERSON247 : author. - Madam President, I have just realised that, owing to the order in which the amendments have been printed on the voting list, I was actually reading out the oral amendment to recital K. I apologise for the confusion, but in fact we are now amending paragraph 2. That may explain why there was some confusion. Could we switch the voting list around? I do apologise, but I have things down in the wrong order on my list. I was actually reading out the change I wanted to make to recital K, rather than to paragraph 2, so that is the one we will be voting on next. I do apologise for the confusion.The amendment to paragraph 2, which should have been the one we took last time, is: 'Believes that a military victory over the LTTE, as envisaged by the Government of Sri Lanka, will not obviate the need to find a political solution in order to ensure a lasting peace'. That is as it is on the voting list.\nPERSON249 : Madam President, in order to be correct, I think we have to vote on recital K now.\nPERSON251 : author. - Madam President, I will now repeat it correctly for the sake of Mr Romeva i Rueda.Recital K, as amended orally, should read now: 'whereas the Tokyo Co-Chairs have called jointly on the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to declare a no-fire period to allow for evacuation of the sick and wounded and provision of humanitarian aid to civilians,'."

"transcript": "PERSON255 : author. - Madam President, I notice once again that the officials have not actually written the oral amendments in the same order as they are actually voted on, so I will be very careful to pick the right order myself this time. For paragraph 2, we want to add the words at the end of the paragraph, 'as well as deliberate impoverishment, arbitrary taxation and land confiscation'.\nPERSON257 : author. - Madam President, amended orally as follows for paragraph 5: 'Welcomes the Thai Government's cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and calls for immediate and full access to all the detained Rohingya boat people in order to define their protection needs; calls, at the same time, on the Government of Thailand to sign the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto;'.\nPERSON259 : author. - Madam President, I will read out the entire text for paragraph 6 as amended orally: 'Stresses that the boat people issue which affects Thailand and other countries is essentially a regional one; views positively the efforts of the Thai Government to increase cooperation among regional neighbours to address the Rohingya issue; welcomes in this respect the meeting held on 23 January by the Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Kasit Piromya, with the Ambassadors of India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Burma; and appeals to the members of ASEAN and, in particular, the Thai chair and relevant international organisations, to work on a permanent solution to this long-standing problem;'.\nPERSON261 : author. - Madam President, recital E should read as follows: 'whereas the United Nations refugee agency has voiced its concern about the reports of mistreatment of the Burmese refugees and gained access to some of the 126 Rohingya still kept in custody by the Thai authorities'."

"transcript": "PERSON006 : I would like, most of all, to express the hope that our work with other European institutions in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, which enters into force in a week, will flow smoothly. I am constantly working on this matter, and am in contact with both the President of the European Commission and the Prime Minister, who represents the Swedish Presidency. I would also like to repeat that the European Parliament is ready to proceed with the hearings of the commissioners-designate. We are prepared for this, and I have also informed both institutions of this - the Council and the Commission (that is, the President of the Commission).Next week, on 1 December, it will be World AIDS Day. It is important that we always, and not only on this day, remember the victims of this terrible disease. Remembrance of the victims and knowledge of the disease may contribute to a reduction in new cases in the future.In two weeks, on 10 December, it will be the 61st anniversary of the adoption and proclamation by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Its adoption was a consequence of the events of the Second World War. The Declaration was adopted unanimously, and it is worth stressing this. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be considered the first significant achievement of the United Nations in the area of the protection of human rights. I draw your attention to this important date, because this area is one of the main interests of the European Parliament, and rightly so. We should always remember this matter."

"transcript": "PERSON043 : We now continue with the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nPERSON044 : (DE) Mr President, in times of climate change and global warming, this much is obvious: we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we must save energy. The EU is already trying to lead the way in this field, sometimes with more and sometimes with less success. At times, there are also apparent attempts to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as in the case of the so-called Ecodesign Directive.In my constituency, there is a very successful business, called Austria Email AG, which manufactures electric boilers. This is particularly practical and useful in Austria, as the majority of our electricity comes from hydroelectric power, and is therefore very environmentally friendly.It now appears that the Ecodesign Directive will ban these boilers in the future, and instead force people to use either gas storage heaters or gas stoves, which in my view makes no sense, as they are far less environmentally friendly than these boilers. In addition to this, 400 jobs are currently at risk in Austria.This is not what we are trying to achieve. It is a negative development. If we are to protect the environment, then we should surely take measures that are reasonable, beneficial and, above all, appropriate. However, we should not risk jobs for the sake of a product that does not really seem expedient.\nPERSON045 : (FR) Mr President, for us, Euronews is a remarkable window on the world, and it is a channel I am very keen on, but I often wonder about the content of its advertisements.When I switched on the television this morning I saw an advert for Macedonia. And what did I read? 'A tax-haven for businesses, average wage EUR 370, 10% income tax' etc.If this is how Macedonia intends to present its application to join the European Union, and if I ask people in my region, 'Do you want Macedonia to join the EU?' - well I assure you it will not work. At a time when we are discussing offshoring within Europe and the fight against social dumping, can we still allow such advertisements to be the window onto social Europe? I do not think so.I also used to wonder about an advert for Iran; at a time when public stonings took place there, we used to allow adverts for that seraphic country.\nPERSON046 : Mr President, we have all heard of the flooding in Ireland over the weekend, with considerable damage caused to many homes, to businesses, to farms, to roads and to water schemes. The restoration costs, while much too early to estimate, could be in the region of EUR 500 million. However, to put the appropriate measures in place to deal with this type of flooding and to ensure it will not happen again could cost billions.It appears that the European Solidarity Fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation. However, I am still hopeful that an application could be considered, but, if not, I suggest that a regional application could be favourably considered, as the north, the west and the south of the country have been affected. Many people in my European constituency, including the counties of Galway, Mayo, Clare, Leitrim and Roscommon, together with the south of Ireland, have been affected by the horrendous flooding that has taken place. I am appealing to the Commission to assist in a pragmatic and urgent manner.(GA) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for giving me the opportunity to raise this important question about the floods that happened in my country.\nPERSON048 : (PT) The recent tragedy caused by Hurricane Ida as it passed through El Salvador between 6 and 8 November included around 200 fatalities, and at least 18 missing people, 15 000 homeless, 80 damaged schools, and the destruction of agricultural crops and essential infrastructure such as streets, electricity networks, water supply, communications and health facilities.Given that El Salvador is one of the countries most afflicted by economic and social difficulties in Central America, it is imperative that the European Union offers a massive level of support in order to tackle the social chaos caused by this natural disaster. The El Salvadorian Government estimates that, given the country's vulnerability to such natural disasters, more than EUR 1 billion will be necessary for the country to restore what has been damaged and to implement a plan for reconstruction and risk mitigation. For this reason, it is seeking the release of extraordinary funds and the redirection of funds available from the European Union.That is the appeal, Mr President. We request that it be communicated to the European Commission and the Council.\nPERSON049 : Mr President, serious problems concerning the 'right of ownership' continue to cause many European Union citizens who have invested in property in countries such as Spain, Bulgaria and Turkey stress, financial ruin and general heartache. This is despite the concerted efforts of many MEPs working on behalf of their constituents and despite lengthy investigations by Parliament into the issue, which, as we know, culminated in the well-received Auken report in March 2009.I have received complaints from many constituents regarding the problems arising from property deals in all these countries. Countless people have found themselves in situations whereby complex zoning laws and urbanisation policies have meant that their properties have been seized without any compensation.I am greatly concerned that more definitive action has not been taken by the EU to attempt to address this problem, despite the overwhelming consensus that it violates the basic rights of European Union citizens. The legality and morality of these practices is at best questionable and, at worst, unveils a corrupt approach to urban development.\nPERSON050 : (EL) Mr President, allow me to share my fellow members' concern about the disparity between the progress report on Turkey towards integration into the European Union and an article published recently in the Wall Street Journal Europe, which reported that the Prime Minister of Turkey, in a recent visit to Iran, confirmed - and endorsed Iran's views - that Iran's nuclear programme is, in his words, for peaceful and philanthropic purposes only. This disparity is also very evident from the fact that Turkey's overall behaviour - such as on 8-9 November in connection with the visit by the President of Sudan to Istanbul - is creating a serious issue. This being so, I would be very grateful if my fellow members would bear these concerns in mind.\nPERSON051 : Mr President, the European Union would like to see itself as a democratic union of 27 democratic states, but we have got to look at the reality. In Belgium only a few years ago, the state took steps to ban one of the larger political parties. In Germany, at about the same time, there were unsuccessful attempts to ban a party on the basis of incriminating statements made by state operatives. In Hungary, opposition parties are physically attacked by the state, their members arrested and tortured. In the United Kingdom, a violent militia sponsored by the governing party and the Leader of the Opposition carries out violent and, in some cases, armed attacks on opponents.There are restrictions on non-violent freedom of speech in almost all European Union countries. Indeed, the European Union is in the forefront of trying to legislate against states of mind - various 'phobias', as they would put it.\nPERSON052 : (EL) Mr President, in light of the start of negotiations on an agreement for the readmission of illegal immigrants between the European Union and Turkey, I should like to point out that we need a commitment by Turkey that it will cooperate in stamping out illegal immigration. I would remind the House at this point that 76.5% of all arrests of illegal immigrants on the borders of the European Union are on Greece's borders. I know full well that, where third countries have cooperated - examples are Italy and Libya and Spain and Mauritania - there have been tangible results. That is why we need progress with readmission agreements; Turkey needs to cooperate with Frontex, with the Greek authorities, and with the authorities of the European Union.\nPERSON053 : Mr President, the EU's is the only international mission to monitor the implementation of the agreements of last August and September between Russia and Georgia. Mrs Ashton should now make it perfectly clear to the Russian side that they should guarantee the EU mission access to the separatist Georgian territories without any further delay.Today, the French Mistral-type helicopter carrier arrived in St Petersburg. The plan to sell this modern warship to Russia is the equivalent of rewarding the Kremlin for its invasion of Georgia last year. In the words of the commander of the Russian navy, this type of ship would have enabled the Russian navy, in August 2008, to carry out its mission in 40 minutes instead of 26 hours. In that case President Sarkozy would have had no time to prevent Mr Putin occupying the Georgian capital.Providing the Russian navy with the newest NATO technology means taking responsibility for encouraging Kremlin hawks to implement their military exercise plans from last September.\nPERSON054 : Mr President, as we meet here in Strasbourg, half the population of the city of Cork, in my constituency of Munster, is without water in their homes - and this is 2009!University College Cork has had to shut down for an entire week, with many students in my Alma Mater effectively homeless. Shop owners, householders and farmers are facing bills running into hundreds of millions of euros, after the worst flooding witnessed in living memory in Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and Galway in particular.Following the devastating floods across central Europe in 2002, the EU established a solidarity fund to assist Member States that had suffered as a result of natural disasters from such flooding. Our colleagues in the north-east of Romania were the most recent recipients of such aid. The rules state that, in certain circumstances where there are extraordinary regional disasters, this aid can be used.I now call on President Barroso and Commissioner Samecki to look favourably on any application received from Ireland for assistance under this fund. In particular, I call on the Irish Government to contact the Commission urgently with a view to submitting an application. It is vital that the EU and Parliament extend their support to various communities in Ireland who are suffering horrendous damage.\nPERSON055 : (HU) In the northern part of Hungary, several tens of thousands of people come across the border from Slovakia to work, while several thousand people have moved and now live in the northern part of Hungary, in Rajka and other villages. Thanks to the excellent infrastructure and the Schengen Agreement, they work in Slovakia and live in Hungary. This is an excellent example of the benefits of the European Union.According to surveys, the Slovaks living in Hungary feel at home in their newly chosen surroundings and the local authorities are now thinking about providing Slovak-language nurseries and schools, even though they are not Hungarian citizens, because bilingualism is an important value in Hungary.The opposite process to this is taking place in Slovakia where the Hungarian ethnic community which has been living there for a thousand years is being severely discriminated against in terms of language rights, with Hungarian being made a second-class language and subordinate to the official language. This is shameful for the whole of the European Union!\nPERSON056 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament's attention to the rules on company transfers contained in Directive 2001/23/EC.I am saying this because Eutelia S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of telecommunications and information technology, counts among its clients some very important businesses, but not just businesses: for example, it also provides services for the Bank of Italy, the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Furthermore, it is involved with the Schengen project, so it manages some very confidential data.In May 2009, Eutelia all but divested itself of its IT branch, transferring it to its subsidiary, Agile, which basically has a fund of only EUR 96 000 to pay its 2 000 employees. Subsequently, in October 2009, 1 192 people received redundancy notices. These people are still employed, despite having received redundancy notices. Moreover, the ridiculous thing is that the rule that I referred to just now imposes specific requirements of entrepreneurship on those who acquire parts of undertakings ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON057 : (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo. Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year. These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali.Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON058 : (PT) I would just like to alert you to the dangers presented by a disease that is threatening coniferous trees in forests within the European Union, namely pine wood nematode, which originated in America. It has been detected in the S\u00e9tubal region of Portugal, and has already spread to other areas of Portugal and Spain. The only effective method of combating the disease is to cut down or burn the trees.It is worth pointing out that forest covers 38% of Portuguese territory and is home to 400 000 landowners. It provides 14% of the industrial GDP, 9% of industrial jobs and 12% of exports. Ultimately, the forests of the European Union are at risk, hence this intervention, which is necessary to establish an emergency plan for preventing this disease, thus far confined to the Iberian Peninsula, from spreading throughout the European Union.An emergency plan should also have sufficient funds behind it to get rid of this problem, which is damaging many businesses, forcing them to close, and harming many workers by robbing them of their livelihood. The whole European Union has a responsibility to do something about this.\nPERSON059 : (SL) First of all, I would like to protest in the strongest terms possible against what my fellow Member from Austria said previously about the protection of minorities in Slovenia. Slovenia does have high minority protection standards and we just wish that Slovenian minorities living in our neighbouring countries had similar rights.Let me now move to another issue. In this age of information technology, information spreads between people very quickly. The more alarming a piece of news is, the faster it spreads, and so the accuracy of information takes second place. What is particularly interesting in this context are news stories which have an effect on people's health and diet.Over the past few weeks in Slovenia, we had a totally inaccurate piece of news being spread by e-mail about Codex Alimentarius. What we, Members of the European Parliament, can do in cases like this is address questions to the European Commission and then wait a few weeks for an expert answer. However, we need to be able to take immediate action, because the damage is done in a very short space of time.For this reason, I propose that the European Commission consider establishing an online information portal where any citizen wishing to contact the Commission directly can receive an answer within three days at the most.\nPERSON060 : (RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the adoption of the Stockholm Programme will definitely have a beneficial impact on Europe's citizens in the new area of freedom, security and justice.As far as illegal migration and cross-border crime are concerned, the forecasts for the coming years indicate that the influx of migrants is set to rise, including at the European Union's eastern border. I am referring in particular to the Republic of Moldova. In the wake of the political changes that have taken place there, this country has clearly expressed the desire to become integrated into the European Union, but is currently in a vulnerable economic position. It also has a reduced capacity to manage issues such as migration and crime at its borders. With a view to strengthening its own external borders and creating a security zone, the European Union must grant the Republic of Moldova considerable economic aid in order to increase its capacity to take action.The European Union must urgently propose an Association Agreement, setting out clear timescales for this country's future accession to the EU. This will make integration much simpler, while the success of this cooperation will also be able to provide a model for other states neighbouring the EU.\nPERSON061 : (GA) Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about the unusual flooding that happened in Ireland at the weekend.Colleagues have spoken about the unprecedented flooding that took place in Ireland at the weekend. I myself visited some of those places in my own constituency - towns like Clonmel, Killarney, Bandon and, of course, Cork City, which is without water for at least another week. University College Cork is also closed as a result of unprecedented flooding - perhaps as a result of the climate change which we speak about so often here in Parliament.Two things need to happen. First, the Irish Government needs to ensure that it and the local authorities implement the EU Floods Directive. That is of paramount importance and must be done. Second, the Irish Government should apply to the European Union for funding under the European Union solidarity fund so that emergency aid can be given to those in most need, as was done in previous times for countries like Germany, France, the Czech Republic and Austria.\nPERSON063 : Mr President, two Azerbaijani youth activists and bloggers, Emin Abdullayev and Adnan Hajizade, have been sentenced to two and a half years and two years respectively, in an unfair trial. The charges against them were fabricated and they have been imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association.The Azerbaijani authorities must release the prisoners of conscience, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Abdullayev, immediately and unconditionally. The Council, the Commission and the Member States of the European Union must raise the issue of democracy and human rights with the Azerbaijani Government. It must be reminded that democratisation is one of the goals of the Eastern Partnership, and Azerbaijan is part of that initiative. Azerbaijan has to live up to its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and partner of the European Union.\nPERSON064 : (EL) Mr President, the imperialist policy of support for Israel by the USA and NATO and the upgrading of relations and of the issues in general contained in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are strengthening the aggression and intransigence of Israel towards the Palestinian people. According to statistics, this year has been the bloodiest for the Palestinian people. A total of 1 443 Palestinians were murdered during the Israeli army's 'Molten Lead' military operation alone, 9 600 Palestinians are being illegally held without trial in Israeli prisons, the wall of shame is 450 kilometres long, with plans to extend it to 750 kilometres, and houses and infrastructure are being demolished on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. We express our solidarity with the Palestinian people and call for an immediate, just and viable solution to the Palestinian question: the creation of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 territories, with its capital in East Jerusalem, which will have sovereignty over its territory and borders and will make provision for the return of refugees and the return of all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.\nPERSON065 : (HU) I would like to draw your attention to the topic which Cornelia Ernst spoke about earlier. I am talking about the start, following the negotiation and signing of readmission agreements, of the process of resettling those who were displaced or forced to flee during the Yugoslav war. This process has started both on a voluntary basis and under coercion, involving, in particular, the minorities living in Kosovo, primarily the Roma, who are ending up in a very difficult situation as a result of this process.I think that it is extremely important for us to take into account the recommendations of international organisations when it comes to implementing these readmission agreements. We know that Kosovo has nothing in terms of social and economic infrastructure to be able to look after these people. The situation developing there is really deplorable. I believe that the European Parliament must speak out on this.\nPERSON066 : (DE) Mr President, last Thursday, news of the unimaginably gruesome killings which took place in Peru was made public. According to agency reports, over a period of years, a gang had beheaded its victims and removed the fat from their bodies, selling it at EUR 10 000 per litre to European cosmetic companies. Are these reports true?In any event, these were inconceivably grisly killings. Having received these gruesome reports, it now falls to us to find out whether the reports in circulation are actually true. The fact remains that we Europeans definitely need to get to the bottom of the matter, in order to rule out the possibility that, as alleged in the reports, European pharmaceutical or cosmetics companies are in some way linked to these unspeakably gruesome murders.\nPERSON067 : We have now finished the one-minute speeches.There were significantly more speeches than usual - over 40 - because of the time we had available. When possible, we will give more opportunities for speaking than is provided for in the Rules of Procedure, which allow 30 such speeches at most."

"transcript": "PERSON098 : \u03a4he next item is the joint debate on the following reports:by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Decision adopting the rules on the confidentiality of Europol information [11943/2009 - C7-0105/2009 -;by Mrs in 't Veld, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Decision adopting the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified information [11944/2009 - C7-0106/2009 -;by Mr Albrecht, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Decision determining the list of third States and organisations with which Europol shall conclude agreements [11946/2009 - C7-0107/2009 -;by Mr Diaz de Mera Garcia Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Decision adopting the implementing rules for Europol analysis work files [11947/2009 - C7-0108/2009 -;by Mrs Alfano, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a Council Decision setting up a European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) and repealing Decision 2001/427/JHA [11421/2009 - C7-0109/2009 -, andby Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on Accreditation of Forensic Laboratory Activities [11419/2009 - C7-0100/2009 -.\nPERSON099 : deputising for the rapporteur. - Mr President, for once in my life, that was good timing! Can I take this opportunity first of all to apologise for my colleague, Timothy Kirkhope, who is unable to be here. What I am about to do is to read the wise wisdom of all his words that he has thought out and put on paper. I will read his views as rapporteur to you. He is the rapporteur of the two reports of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.Firstly, I would like to focus on Timothy's report on the draft Council Decision adopting the rules on the confidentiality of Europol information. The rules to be established are to apply security measures to all information which is processed by, or through, Europol: in other words, a common standard for protection of information that passes through communication channels between Europol and the national units of Member States.Along with his fellow rapporteurs for the Europol package, they have endured a frustrating time negotiating the timescale and legality of the draft Council Decisions. Following President Klaus's signature and therefore the Treaty of Lisbon becoming a reality, the negotiations with the Council and Commission have become obsolete. This report, along with his colleagues' reports, calls for a rejection of the Council text.He would like to make it clear that he supports the aim of the Council Decision, as we are in favour of better exchange of information, and recognise the benefits Europol brings to Member States regarding law enforcement and crime fighting.We would like to keep Europol's remit and scope small and specific and thereby make the agency as efficient and effective as possible. We also need to recognise that sovereign states have their role to play in that they control their national police forces and security services. However, without prejudice to the overall support of the European Police Office, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its effects on police cooperation, the rapporteur, and his fellow rapporteurs in the LIBE Committee, feel that there should be no amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision until such measures can be adopted under the new legal framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon.We therefore call on the Council to withdraw its proposal and, as stated in the report, call on the Commission or the Council to make a declaration in plenary on a proposal for a new Europol decision, which shall be submitted six months following the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.Now I would like to turn to the second report on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain for the adoption of a Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities. This is an initiative of Sweden and Spain on ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body in order to combat crime through closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the Member States. Over the last couple of years, information exchange in the area of judicial and law-enforcement cooperation has become a high priority for the European Union and its Member States in the crime-prevention and crime-fighting potential.The purpose of this draft framework decision is to ensure that the results of laboratory activities in one Member State are recognised as being equivalent to the results of laboratory activities in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing legal certainty to the suspects and improved judicial cooperation where evidence of one Member State is used in proceedings in another Member State.This purpose is achieved by ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body to comply with international standards. The framework decision would apply to laboratory activities relating to DNA and fingerprints, and each Member State ensures that the results of the accredited laboratory activities carried out in other Member States are recognised as equivalent to the results of the accredited domestic laboratory activities. However, it will, of course, always remain the responsibility of each individual judicial authority to assess any evidence, forensic or not, in accordance with its own national law.Again, I would like to stress that we support the aims of the Council's framework decision. However, again, there are problems regarding the legal basis of this initiative with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The report therefore calls for a rejection of the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain. The legal clarity regarding LIBE reports is unclear in light of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. This report will be submitted at a later date under a legal basis that is clear. We would suggest that this would allow this important subject to be examined in more detail, as, again, the timetable imposed was very short and did not afford Parliament the time it would have wanted on such an important subject.\nPERSON101 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I will be very brief in order to make up for Mr Nicholson and ensure that we do not run late.The Lisbon Treaty will be in force - if I calculate correctly - seven days and five hours from now. I must say that the rush by the Council to adopt a whole series of decisions is somewhat embarrassing in the light of this. What I also find embarrassing is that there is an empty seat here, where I would have hoped to see the Council so that we could actually have an exchange of views.I basically endorse the proposals made by the previous speaker. Of course, we support the development of Europol. We want a strong Europol. We want a Europol that is able to operate and fight against crime, but we also want a Europol that is subject to democratic scrutiny. I therefore endorse the proposal made by the previous speaker to ask the Council to withdraw the proposals on Europol and present a new proposal within a maximum of six months - and preferably earlier - under the Lisbon Treaty.Finally, when it comes to the specific subject that I am rapporteur for - which is Europol and the transfer of personal data and confidential documents to third parties - I would like to hear from the Council - which is absent - on how it feels about the analysis made by the European Parliament's Legal Service to the effect that the legal basis chosen for this particular proposal is the wrong one. I do not know who is going to answer for the Council, but maybe it can come back on this and send somebody who can provide us with a reply.\nPERSON102 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I can agree with the previous speakers in so far as I think that it would only be sensible for the Council to present its proposals concerning Europol to the European Parliament once again, on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon.It is right and necessary for the judicial and police cooperation in Europe to be discussed and codecided by Parliament. Only in this way can Europol's work enjoy sufficient legitimacy. The European Parliament's joint and decisive rejection of the provisions proposed by the Council, pertaining to Europol's work, is a clear signal that amendments to the legal basis now have to be applied.What is more, there is every reason to do so. For far too long, the implementation of European internal and security policy has been a task reserved exclusively for the executive, carried out behind closed doors. Not least in the context of the anti-terrorism measures taken following the attacks on 11 September 2001, numerous rafts of security legislation were approved, whose necessity, effectiveness and suitability was, in many cases, not thoroughly assessed, or even discussed. The political remoteness of the third pillar of the European Union has made it possible for the governments to impose highly controversial restrictions on the fundamental rights of the citizens.This has produced a very dangerous imbalance in one area in particular. While there is now closer cooperation between the security forces throughout the world, there is no international consensus on minimum standards in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection. This gulf between government powers and civil rights is becoming increasingly pronounced, especially with regard to the exchange of personal data between the EU and third countries,. European security agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and Frontex, as well as information systems such as Schengen, Eurodac or the customs and visa database, are being used to store an increasing volume of personal data, and the linking and analysis of this data, for various purposes, is progressing rapidly. Even within Europe, it is becoming less clear who is allowed to collect, possess, analyse or pass on what data, and the conditions under which they may do so. Thus, the issue of legal protection is frequently sidelined, in the light of the principles which govern the current system.However, what would happen if all this data was passed on only to third countries? We are not merely talking about countries such as Norway or Switzerland, but also the United States, Russia, and even Morocco or China. I wonder who would guarantee that this data was protected from abuse and arbitrary actions on the part of states to the same extent as has hitherto been the case. This Parliament actually has the right and the duty to use the new legal basis provided by the treaty to initiate a process whereby the fundamental rights of European citizens will have to be respected, without any limitations, including in the context of international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. Common minimum standards must be put in place, specifically with regard to the protection of personal data, before we, as the European Union, sign any further agreements on the exchange of data with third countries.This applies to the information obtained by Europol, as well as SWIFT banking data and flight passenger data, which are exchanged with the US authorities. Clear data protection standards, a comprehensive proportionality assessment and effective legal protection for citizens are key prerequisites for any further measures.I am pleased that we have managed to reach this level of consensus across the political spectrum regarding the legislation on Europol, and I view this as a good sign for the forthcoming discussion on the comprehensive protection of fundamental rights in Europe. That is precisely what EU citizens now expect from us.\nPERSON103 : Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the Europol package is made up of four draft decisions that seek to implement the Council Decision of 6 April 2009.Firstly, Mr President, I wish to join with my fellow Members in asking for the Council proposal to be withdrawn. We want a Parliament that is much more visible and a Treaty of Lisbon that makes the decisions with regard to the Europol package. We want Parliament and the Council to be on an equal footing and in balance with each other.In order to ensure that the reasons for my rejection of the proposal are better understood, I will say a few words about the subject of my report. One of the main tasks entrusted to the European Police Office is the job of collecting, storing, processing, analysing and exchanging information and data. So that it can carry out this important task, the competent authorities in the Member States need to send comprehensive, up-to-date, accurate information to Europol. This is the only way that Europol will be able to use its capacity for analysis to the full.The scope of application of the draft Council Decision is limited, as defined in Article 2, to the processing of data for the purpose of analysis, in accordance with the mandate given in Article 14(1) of the Decision. To this end, Europol currently has 19 types of work files for the purpose of analysis. Each work file is a separate database, each linked to a specific type of criminal activity. Each database is therefore closely linked to the specific type of operational support that Europol can offer pursuant to the powers vested in it.Currently, the work files are the only legal tool at European level for storing, processing and analysing information, whether it be information from the field or intelligence, including personal data.The proposal also contains rules and general principles relating to both technical measures and rules for using them. The need to collect and process information means that a legal instrument must be created that guarantees full respect of fundamental rights. I would like to point out that this means full respect of the fundamental rights of European citizens. At the same time, such an instrument must guarantee that Europol can carry out the functions assigned to it in full. In this respect, echoing Mrs in 't Veld, I question whether or not the legal basis it is intended to apply is correct.In this area, Mr President, the role of the European Parliament as the House representing citizens is inalienable. The compulsory control by the European Parliament is inalienable. For this reason, it is essential that, in view of the immediate entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament takes part in the legislative process on an equal footing with the Council. No grounds for urgency could carry more weight than the importance of defending civil liberties and the security of Europeans.I therefore urge my esteemed fellow Members to join in rejecting the proposed instruments, without lessening our support for the European Police Office - which we do indeed support - until the Council allows Parliament to be part of the decision-making process. I also propose that we ask the Commission and the Council to withdraw the proposal and put forward a fresh one that respects the competences laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.Mr President, when I speak again, I will give a more convincing and clearer explanation of my position. That is all for the moment.\nPERSON104 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the European Crime Prevention Network.This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA. Its objectives were to facilitate cooperation and exchanges of information and experiences at national and European level; to collect and analyse relevant information aimed in particular at the exchange of best practices; to organise conferences, seminars, meetings and initiatives with the objective of facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practices; and to provide its expertise to the Council and the Commission concerning crime prevention.The Decision envisaged that the structure would be based on contact points designated by the Commission and the Member States; these contact points were to include at least one representative from the national authorities, while the other designated contact points could be researchers or university academics specialising in this field. Member States were, in any case, required to involve researchers, university academics, NGOs and civil society. Even Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were involved in the work as expert bodies.In 2005, the network underwent its first internal structural reform. This foresaw the permanent establishment of two commissions - one for the work programme and one for research - while the running of the website was transferred from the European Commission to the United Kingdom, which still keeps it updated.In 2007, there was another review, which acknowledged the particular need to strengthen the secretariat and highlighted the need to confront the problem of resources for the permanent commissions and the national representatives.In March 2009, an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network. This focused on the importance of the objectives that brought the network into being but, at the same time, regrettably highlighted the organisational failure that had impeded the achievement of the important objectives that we were speaking of earlier.The problems thus brought to light, which have led to the virtual collapse of the network, included the lack of suitable resources, an ineffective secretariat, lack of commitment on the part of the national representatives and a very poor work programme.The evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network. In consequence, the network appointed a working group to examine the recommendations made in March 2009 and took the view that certain amendments needed to be made to the Act that created the network. In particular, it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from Community programmes.Although some Member States had revived the idea of disbanding the network, others suggested that it should be reformed. The Swedish Presidency of the European Council agreed with this proposal, to the extent of making it a priority in its own six-month term of office. At this point, I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats, given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself.The proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each Member State and of a board of directors. This board of directors should be made up of national representatives appointed by Member States and would be presided over by a chairman in charge of an executive committee.I think there is also some confusion in this respect between contact points and national representatives. Civil society, the academic world, the world of experience and hence, of experts, are all being completely left out of the network. This is a very serious matter. The structural links between the network and the other Community institutions and bodies that are concerned with crime and its prevention have been completely cut off.The Decision does not envisage any form of cooperation with the European Parliament and the requirement for knowledge of languages has been omitted, despite having been requested previously.Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons. First, it has been unable to fulfil the objectives for which it was created; second, there has been no cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Member States, and I believe that this must be regarded as a sort of sabotage of the network itself.Crime prevention cannot be reduced to the exchange of best practices. Unfortunately, we have witnessed what is almost a type of tourism on the part of various officials who have visited various countries and have often not even managed to speak to one another because there were no interpreters. The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective. To make the network function, I think we should strengthen its powers, and also incorporate the fight against crime and the prevention of organised crime.I therefore suggest that we reject this proposal, which could have been accepted only if the Council had presented a genuinely ambitious proposal. Unfortunately, this has not happened.\nPERSON105 : Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the speeches given by Mr Nicholson, Mrs in 't Veld, Mr Albrecht and Mrs Alfano. This is a debate in which problems of both procedure and substance have arisen.Regarding the procedural matters, I fully understand Parliament's position. The Treaty of Lisbon is just about to enter into force. I therefore wholly appreciate the questions that some of the Council Decisions may raise in Parliament. It is also true that the Commission somewhat regrets this situation. Nevertheless, I would now like to shed some light on these three dossiers for the benefit of Parliament.As you are all aware, Europol - through a Council Decision that will replace the intergovernmental convention - is going to be subject to a new legal framework and become a European agency on 1 January 2010. The Council's adoption of this decision was preceded by lengthy negotiations, and preparations for its implementation are under way.I do understand Parliament's concerns and I, too, am looking forward to seeing the next institutional framework in place, since it will pave the way for greater democratic control over the European Police Office. We should learn lessons from the initial implementation of the Council's existing decision so that we may have a solid foundation on which to build future legislation. To that end, it will be beneficial to involve Parliament and other interested parties when drawing up future regulations on Europol, particularly with regard to the terms by which this Parliament and the national parliaments will have control over Europol's activities.Nonetheless, Mr President, I regret that Parliament has rejected the draft Council Decisions. These are implementing provisions governing important aspects of Europol's work, without which Europol cannot operate.I now come to the matter of forensic laboratories. Once again, I understand that Parliament wants a different basis for this framework decision on the accreditation of forensic laboratory activities. The Commission is in favour of using accreditation because it encourages a higher quality of work from these laboratories, particularly when it comes to sensitive techniques relating to fingerprints and DNA samples. Stricter accreditation of these laboratories will lead to increased public confidence.Again, I am aware of the problems with the legal basis. Like Parliament, the Commission believes that the framework decision, insofar as it refers to services under Article 50 of the founding treaty of the European Community, should have Article 50 as its legal basis. We in the Commission have made a declaration that is contained in the minutes of the JHA council meeting of 23 October 2009. In that declaration, the Commission reserves the right to take measures that it deems to be appropriate in the future.May I add that, in accordance with provisions for financial regulations, the Commission is prepared to provide financial support for the activities of Member States that allow the accreditation of scientific police laboratories. Finally, the Commission is willing to evaluate the implementation and application of this instrument for 1 July 2018, as laid down by Article 7(4) (new).Regarding this accreditation, although I understand Parliament's position, I also think that it goes mainly in the right direction and respects all the views that have been expressed in this House.I shall now move on to the European Union Crime Prevention Network. Naturally, we believe that crime must be prevented. Coercive measures are not enough to reduce crime and organised crime. Prevention is vital, be it at local or cross-border level. Moreover, in the proposals I recently made on human trafficking and child pornography, I have anticipated preventative measures.Mrs Alfano, you have just pointed out the weaknesses of the network. I am aware that a recent assessment concluded that there is a very real need for European cooperation in the fight against organised crime, and I also know that public bodies, organisations and the private sector wish for a multidisciplinary approach aimed at sharing experiences, methods and instruments within Europe.To be sure, the European Union Crime Prevention Network has encountered strategic, political and organisational problems. The Commission is aware of these. In the short term, we have increased financial support to the network's secretariat.In the Stockholm Programme, we have prioritised police cooperation and the need to be able to manage this at Community level, in conformity with the Treaty of Lisbon. It is true that this network can fulfil a number of tasks that you have mentioned and can undertake tasks of which you have suggested some interesting examples.We can also expect to see common projects between social and educational institutions, involving schools, continuing training and university degree courses. We are clearly at the start of a major new crime prevention policy.It is obvious that the role of civil society and of Parliament should be increased. Furthermore, police cooperation now comes under codecision. I therefore think that we can cooperate as closely as possible within the framework of the new legal basis. This would be in the interests of all citizens affected by security issues in their daily lives.Of course, I have some regrets about this debate, which has centred on both the procedure to follow and on the substance. However, I do think that we can do much better from now on, after the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force and in keeping with the Stockholm Programme. Parliament will be able to play its full role in this new strategy against organised crime and, indeed, all forms of crime.\nPERSON106 : on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) I should like to thank Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, for the answers he has given us and for the views he has contributed on the various topics.Judicial cooperation in the European Union is a matter of great importance. When we speak of a citizens' Europe, we are, in particular, talking about judicial cooperation. In that respect, combating crime is our number one priority, primarily because crime is increasingly crossing over borders. Large-scale cross-border crime is often the big issue, compared to which national crime seems like little more than petty hooliganism.On that score, the Group of the European People's Party is strongly in favour of not just Europol but also Eurodac being put in a strong position. I refer here to our framework for forensic laboratories.An important element of combating organised crime is the democratic supervision of those who are combating crime. I certainly do not want to detract from that in any way, but I would ask that you take into account the position of the victim and that you continue to do so as we debate the proposals over the coming months. Combating crime often involves considering the rights of suspects, which is only right, because a suspect's privacy and his/her position in criminal proceedings are very important. However, over the course of the next five years, I would like us to pay more attention to the victim's position. Mr President, fundamental rights are not absolute; they must always be exercised in context. Or, as it says in the words of the Dutch Constitution: 'subject to every regard being paid to the law'. That applies equally to suspects and victims.I can well understand that, and I agree that, for the time being, Parliament has to say: 'Hang on a minute!' when it comes to these four dossiers. Let us wait until 1 December, when we will have new proposals, and then we will have to take a reality check: one that demands the real involvement of the European Parliament.\nPERSON107 : Mr President, we have a problem, because the whole House is asking the Commission to revise the legislative package on these matters, and Mr Barrot has, very charmingly as always, told us that this goes back a long way, that it has been debated a great deal and that on 1 January, it will begin to operate. That is the reality: we have a problem.I can tell you now, Mr Barrot, that you should tell your successor, as I realise that you cannot answer us on this matter, that when she attends the hearings in Parliament, we are going to ask her whether she intends to draw up a package of legislation on this matter, because the whole House is asking for it and it is not just a case of an over-zealous push for legislation.It is not that Parliament is saying that it wants to be involved; it has to be involved. It has to be involved because it will have that legislative role in a few days' time, and because this is not now a matter of parliamentary control, rather that we want to make further proposals. For example, in many of the directives and decisions that come here, I see many gaps, many shortcomings and a great deal of legal insecurity. We would like to reform these provisions here.I think that it is good for Europol to work with them. I understand that Europol is already working with them, and I want it to continue to do so, because I want Europol to move forward. I also want you to respect the right of this House to say what it thinks of these provisions, because that is its legislative function and we want to carry it out.I am therefore telling you now that when the next Commissioner appears before us, we will ask her if she is committed to drawing up legislative proposals on this matter in order for Parliament to legislate. That is all, nothing further.\nPERSON108 : Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my comment will be brief. It firstly concerns the substance and secondly the procedure, and I will repeat some of what has already been very well expressed by all the political groups.Whilst creating an area of security, justice and freedom within the European Union is vital for us all, and certainly an example of the European democratic model that we are building, and while many of us consider Europol to be an instrument that can be adapted, we nevertheless all set great store by the fact that the pooling of resources - particularly human resources but also technical resources to fight organised crime and all kinds of trafficking - should be strictly controlled with a maximum guarantee of legal certainty, since we are striking at the very heart of our power: the rights and freedoms of European citizens.Regarding the procedure, at the risk of sounding repetitive, I would like to assure the Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that all the work carried out has not been in vain. However, our citizens would misunderstand and misinterpret things entirely if, after waiting for such a long time to put into operation the institutions relating to the Treaty of Lisbon, we did not have the patience to wait a few more hours or even days in order to exercise the colegislative power that we hold so dear.For once in Europe, it is vital that we wait a few weeks until we have a text that respects our procedural framework and, like Mrs in 't Veld, I am sorry not to see the Council here with us because this is primarily a Council matter. On behalf of my committee, I therefore believe we should have a new legislative proposal.\nPERSON109 : Mr President, to continue in the same vein, I would like to take the floor as coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on matters concerning freedom, which is precisely my point.It would be incomprehensible if, given the chance to carry out this colegislative work with the European Parliament, we then failed to do so. We therefore all agree on that point. In any case, we will need to wait and see how this develops, but it would clearly be a problem if we were unable to participate as we are legitimately requesting.I also wanted to mention another brief point concerning the report on forensic laboratories - for this is the issue I have been following - and to say as clearly as possible that, when discussing the need for coordination, we must also examine the matter of decentralisation very carefully. Let us not forget that, in certain Member States, there is no single centre for forensic study but rather several, taking into account the distribution of territories and existing police and legal systems. Such is the case in Spain. It is important to be aware of this, because if we are going to coordinate successfully, we need to bear in mind that we are not only looking at coordination between Member States but also between regions with distinct circumstances that may not apply at national level.\nPERSON110 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall repeat what a number of my fellow Members have already said.Before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has been asked, under the urgency procedure, to examine four texts on Europol and the issue of protecting the confidentiality of data passed on by Europol, including to third countries. We in this Parliament unanimously condemn the way in which we have been requested to examine these texts when they concern issues that will most certainly be a matter for codecision after the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force.Many of us believe that our citizens have a right to security and that the fight against terrorism is a priority. Everything possible must be done so that our citizens do not live in constant fear of becoming the victims of terrorist attacks. It is therefore important to do all we can to strengthen police cooperation, but this cannot be done at any price and especially not to the detriment of the fundamental public right to privacy, free movement and free expression.May I add that preventing crime should not mean more - and only more - coercive measures. It is a privilege for our democracies to protect our freedom at all times and not to undermine it unless absolutely necessary. Police cooperation should therefore take place within a specific legal framework that ensures the confidentiality of information passed on and the correct balance between information and the security aims mentioned.The GUE/NGL Group, along with the other groups, thus calls on the Council and the Commission to withdraw these proposals. Furthermore, I also regret that the Council is not here today.\nPERSON111 : on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, these reports lay down the rules for Europol gathering and exchanging information between EU Member States - and, indeed, third-party nations - of the most personal kind about EU citizens.Significantly, they talk about the unauthorised disclosure of such information not disadvantaging, harming or prejudicing the essential interests of Europol. There is nothing about protecting the interests of the hapless, innocent citizen who might get caught up in the nightmare of a Europol investigation.The most personal information may be collected, including sexual preferences and bank account details. This may even be shared with third-party countries, including those of such outstanding democratic credentials as Albania, Peru and the Russian Federation.Europol is totally unnecessary from any objective point of view, but the EU's subjective point of view is that it is essential to have another of those attributes of a political state: its own police force.How many of the EU's reluctant citizens know that Europol officers have immunity from prosecution for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties? For those of you here who have only just emerged from police states, this may not be very significant, but such immunity for law-enforcement officers is a concept alien to English law.As the EU creates its own judicial system with instruments such as the European arrest warrant and trials in absentia, and now its own police force, we in Britain are seeing the destruction of our most basic and cherished liberties that have formerly protected us.Every single rapporteur at least had the decency to say that these proposals should be rejected until the Lisbon Treaty was legally in force. If the EU had any decency, there would be referenda on the Lisbon Treaty and none of it would ever come into force.\nPERSON112 : (DE) Mr President, if, in the recent past, Europol's actions have, once again, succeeded in putting an end to human trafficking rings which smuggle in illegal migrants, then that is laudable. In the future, it would be equally laudable for Europol to be involved in tackling all kinds of serious, international crime. Of course, cooperation between various authorities in the fight against crime is, in principle, a good thing.However, the issue of data protection has not been resolved with regard to the plans to grant all authorities unlimited access to data. We are being fobbed off with promises of a Data Protection Supervisor, when it is not even clear what supervisory powers they actually have. The national data protection officials are already rapidly finding the limits to their scope of action, have barely any power to intervene and little real impact. This will probably also be the case at EU level.During the last decade, civil liberties and freedoms have been increasingly restricted in the name of the fight against terrorism. If, especially now, before the Treaty of Lisbon grants the European Parliament these codecision rights, the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs want to rapidly push through an agreement on financial transactions, then it is only because they know that massive data protection issues are associated with it and that they would not get away unscathed in the case of the SWIFT agreement. Given that even the national law enforcement agencies are not granted this right under their respective constitutions, then why should Europol and, via the back door of the EU, the United States, in particular, be granted such unlimited rights? In my opinion, we should stop this attack on data protection.\nPERSON113 : (FR) Mr President, allow me first to express my congratulations and thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission for everything he has done as the Commissioner responsible for this area.I hope that the two Commissioners who succeed you - not one Commissioner but two - will draw inspiration from your political vision, your commitment and your work. Thank you, Mr Vice-President.(MT) Please allow me now to come to the point concerning the excellent opportunity I recently had to visit the office in my country responsible for Europol, relations with Europol as well as the Schengen area. In this office, there are a number of police officers who are carrying out excellent work in this area in collaboration with police officers in other EU Member States. I applaud their efforts and would like to add that this visit gave me the opportunity to appreciate the huge importance of the Europol agency. I had the opportunity to appreciate it from close quarters; its importance in combating criminality, especially since we now live in an area of liberty, of free movement within the European Union and within many European Union countries.Obviously, the reason why we shall be voting against these proposals is not because we hold something against Europol, but indeed because we as the European Parliament want to contribute towards strengthening this office, which from next year will become an agency, so that it can truly accomplish its mission of combating criminality in a truly effective manner.\nPERSON115 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the request from the Council that we approve the proposal for exchanges of information between Europol and partners, including third countries, one can see what this would lead to: the proposal, if approved, would create the absurd situation of regulating, among other things, the exchange of information between Europol and third countries without Parliament having yet approved any such list of countries.This proposal, in its depiction of the handling of personal data, seems to pave the way for the creation of a truly limitless database which could even be made available to third parties that have not yet been specified by Parliament.Article 15(2) of the Council's proposal states that in cases of absolute necessity, even where there is no suggestion that a crime has been carried out, data may be transmitted that reveal a person's race, ethnic origin, political stance, religious and philosophical convictions, trade union membership and so on, without it being specified what is meant by 'absolute necessity' and, worse still, by endorsing the idea that there is such a thing as racial groups.It would be interesting to hear the Council clarify what a racial group is and which racial groups exist. As far as I am concerned, I believe that there is only one race - the human race.For these reasons, but also to maintain the independence of Parliament, which must work within the necessary time limits, I believe that the Council's proposal in its present form must be rejected by the requested deadline of 30 November.\nPERSON116 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to join Mr Busuttil in thanking the Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Barrot, for the work he has carried out. He has certainly not taken on an easy legislative dossier, and has often battled against the wind and rain, but trust me, Mr Vice-President, you would have found an excellent umbrella in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which you could have used in these kinds of situations. Nevertheless, much has been said about Europol, so I do not think I need to repeat what fellow MEPs have already said, namely that it seems surprising that, before the 30 November, that is to say before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are still expected to pass this through Parliament. In that respect, it is a natural reaction for Parliament to reject these proposals.It is also a shame that the Council cannot honour us with its presence today, so that it can also take these comments on board. I am sure that they will be taken into account. I wanted, above all, to comment on Mr Kirkhope's report on forensic laboratories and standards, by saying that we often have to consider whether we should begin with the details of the matter, namely what data will be transmitted and how, and whether this data is truly comparable, especially in the case of forensic laboratories. If DNA data is obtained in different ways and then transmitted and a match is not possible, then more harm than help is done to the person concerned. Perhaps one should bear these thoughts in mind.\nPERSON117 : (DE) Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, thank you for your understanding of Parliament's clear stance in relation to procedural issues. We are not rejecting the proposals of the Council and the Commission. Rather, we want to take part in the decision-making process. That is the crucial point, in terms of our vote.It is quite clear that Europol is one of the European Union's success stories. Particularly in the fight against drug crime, human trafficking, the funding of terrorism and the printing of counterfeit money, Europol plays a pivotal role in terms of the exchange of information and provides a focus for existing police cooperation networks. It is of the utmost importance that its functions are expanded further. That is why we should also welcome the fact that the agency will have a new basis. That is where we will need an exchange of data and internal links between the police forces in the European Union. We need this in order to successfully combat terrorism and crime. We also need these things - and that must be made equally clear - in order to uphold the rights of European citizens.Here is a European attitude, and clear European values, which were also reinforced here in Parliament by a broad majority in the Decision on SWIFT codes in mid-September. We have to demand the following from the Council and the Commission: this fundamental principle, and these guidelines, now also have to be implemented in negotiations with the United States. We need to do this in order to ensure the security of European citizens.\nPERSON118 : (HU) I, too, am pleased that the Council has made a commitment to the further development and reform of the European Crime Prevention Network. In light of this, it is really a pity - as several people have already mentioned - that the representatives of the Council are no longer present during this debate.I, too, would like to separate my comments on the process from the actual contents. The decision that this network was necessary was made 10 years ago. The current assessment has shown that the network has not made the most of the opportunities which might have been given. However, it has also been made clear that we need such a network, and we need to develop it further, involve civilians and researchers, and cooperate with law enforcement agencies. I, too, would like to say that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament regards the network's work and further development as important. The fact that the European Parliament is now rejecting this initiative is precisely so that this measure will have even stronger legitimacy under the Treaty of Lisbon and that we can become more actively involved in it.\nPERSON119 : (SV) Mr President, Europe's greatest failure today is that we have still not succeeded in putting a stop to the people-trafficking that is going on right in front of our eyes. Women and children are sold like commodities over the counter throughout our Member States. A conservative estimate by Europol suggests that half a million women will be bought and sold in Europe in 2009. This is something that we have to talk openly about and we need to come up with strategies to eradicate it.There are institutions within the EU whose goal it is to combat people-trafficking and organised crime, but as things currently stand, these have many shortcomings. Cooperation between the Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament needs to improve radically for us to have any chance of tackling serious crime once and for all. This includes organised crime, the activities of the mafia and people trafficking, too.In just a few days' time, the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into full force. I think we will then be able to breathe a little easier, because we will finally have the hope of deeper cooperation to ensure the security of our citizens throughout the Member States. Soon, we will be able to see Europol strengthened and there will be effective cooperation between Europol and Eurojust. Then we will finally be able to take up the fight against organised crime in Europe, including people-trafficking and mafia-like crime syndicates. Let us, in 2009, once and for all say that people-trafficking is unworthy of Europe in this day and age.\nPERSON120 : (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should discuss today's debate, and particularly the decisions which follow the discussion, not from a formal, but rather a political perspective.Uniform standards for laboratory work are, of course, also important for cooperation between the police and the judiciary that is based on trust. However, there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss. In principle, however, the core issue is altogether different, namely how seriously the political acteurs take the Treaty of Lisbon, the rights of the Parliament and the citizens, as well as the trustworthy cooperation of the Council and the Parliament.I would like to give three examples: the Treaty of Lisbon describes the High Representative as a strong voice for Europe, and it is a great shame that the Member States have clearly also applied different criteria in this case. The agreement on SWIFT codes, which is controversial in many ways, could once again be subjected to careful scrutiny by the European Parliament next Monday. Instead, it is to be quickly ticked off the list a few hours beforehand and signed with the United States.We are facing the same situation with the topics we are dealing with here. Shortly before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, we are being asked to quickly push through decisions, which include provisions for the future which will limit our scope for making decisions, or at least significantly restrict them. We have to ask ourselves why this is the case, as it was certainly possible to submit new proposals on other issues.The Council's and the Commission's stance lost them the chance to send a clear message to the people of Europe, a sign of commitment to implementing the treaty, a sign of a democratic Europe of the citizens. We, the European Parliament, have only one option: we must reject these proposals, as we want a broad public debate and we want to use our strengthened rights to support the citizens now, rather than in the near or more distant future.\nPERSON121 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening's very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points, particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network.Firstly, now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced, and in two ways. First, culture: organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness. A great Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia, used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end. The end must consist of a huge mobilisation in cultural terms, and it must start in Europe and in Parliament.A second point is that organised crime must be combated more effectively, above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service, and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes, foreseen only in certain Member States. I am thinking, for instance, of mafia crimes.We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe, since mafia organisations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well. There is a very close relationship between mafia organisations and corruption, as recent reports have also emphasised, and fraud in the European Union, as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too.\nPERSON122 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of one of the dossiers on Europol, I can only reassert what has already been said by the Members who have spoken before me.Thanks to its role in the collection, analysis and exchange of information, Europol facilitates investigations in Member States and has thus become an important tool in the fight against crime.We need to be more effective in tackling crime, but at the same time, we must resolutely assert the authority of this Parliament.The Council has decided that it will, in any case, adopt the texts of the Europol package on 30 November, without waiting for Parliament to obtain the power of codecision on this matter with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December.The aim of rejecting the proposals is not to stand in the way of Europol assuming its new role as a European body, but to have the powers of this Parliament, the European Parliament, extended, especially on important matters relating to freedom, security and justice.Finally, I think that it is right to give Parliament greater powers of scrutiny over Europol's activities in order to check that the handling of data held by Europol does not undermine the rights of European citizens.\nPERSON123 : (SK) The field of forensic medicine has gained prominence in recent years, mainly due to its ever increasing importance in the fight against crime and criminality.The high level of cooperation between countries may, in this regard, help towards greater effectiveness in the fight against crime. Practical experience shows clearly that such cooperation is not enough in itself and that it is essential to create a common legal framework setting out standards for the activities of forensic laboratories as well as a network of such highly-qualified laboratories across the entire European Union.The fact that there is no agreement through which common accreditation standards could be applied to the analysis of scientific evidence is a serious deficiency which must be corrected. I hope for this reason that the Council will launch initiatives as soon as possible and produce a new document as soon as possible in which the European Parliament will also have considerable involvement.Despite the fact that I wanted to talk more about forensic laboratories, Mr President, I would like to say in conclusion that it is definitely not my ambition to inflate the importance of the European Parliament, but I consider it absolutely unprecedented that no representative of the Council was able to find the time to come here and listen to our views.\nPERSON124 : (PL) Mr President, speaking as a law graduate and former police officer, I would like to stress the importance of the Council framework decision, whose objective is to oblige all forensic laboratories supplying the results of genetic and fingerprint tests to observe the ISO 17025 international standard. This extremely significant decision is intended to strengthen the credibility and reliability of the evidentiary process, and, in so doing, to increase the confidence of society in law enforcement agencies and the justice system.\nPERSON125 : (PL) Mr President, we will probably return to this subject in six months, when we will find ourselves facing the same problems. On the one hand, it will be important for us that the police and Europol work as effectively as possible. On the other hand, we must always remember that we are also dealing here with matters of human rights, and very often with matters of sensitive data.The same work will be waiting for us, and so in relation to this, I would like to call attention in particular to Article 15 of the Council Decision adopting the implementing rules governing Europol's relations with partners, including the exchange of personal data and classified information. For I would like to draw attention to the fact that we are talking, here, about very sensitive data, and we are saying that transmission of such data shall not be permitted unless strictly necessary. We need to think about who is to decide what is strictly necessary, because this is an extremely significant question.\nPERSON126 : Mr President, my job has not been easy given the Council's absence. Even so, I would like to mention some of the reasons that have led your Commission to agree to table these texts nonetheless.Concerning Europol first of all, it would be difficult to stop Europol from becoming an agency. There will be other texts on Europol, and Parliament will, of course, be colegislator. It would be very difficult to interrupt Europol's work. May I also clarify that the head of Europol is now a British man of great quality. It would be a shame to somehow interrupt Europol's work.Regarding the other two texts, it is important to recognise that these are the result of an initiative by the Council and the Member States. Even so, it is a step forward for Member States to have accepted the idea of laboratory accreditation in order to have reliable data. It is a positive result and a step forward.As for the prevention network - and this is where Parliament's observations are most justified - it will surely be necessary in the future to strengthen it and give it other tasks. I understand you perfectly and I thank Mr Busuttil and Mr Strasser - and the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was here earlier too - for having understood that I also feel strongly that Parliament should be closely involved. Everything I have done over the past five years has been thanks to Parliament's support. I am therefore, as you know, truly keen for Parliament to be involved.Moreover, I would like to add that the Commission believes we need an in-depth, case-by-case analysis in order to determine whether or not we should change the third pillar acquis. It is important to understand that we are in a period of transition from an intergovernmental approach to a community approach, and I am delighted for Justice and Home Affairs.I am also conscious of the fact that you are all keen to be involved in a form of police cooperation that is respectful of human rights and mindful of the European Union's values. Of course! I believe that Parliament's role will have a positive impact on all future texts that will enable us to take police cooperation further, once again in conformity with citizens' values and rights.Nevertheless, this is a period of transition and I entirely understand your desire to become involved in the preparation of these texts. However, I repeat that the Commission believes that we should review the texts of the third pillar acquis in a full, case-by-case analysis. Should existing instruments become obsolete or need supplementing or updating, then we will be able to make proposals. My successors will make proposals that allow Parliament to improve the texts, for it will at last be colegislator.On this point, Mr President, may I reiterate that at the end of my term of office, I will pay careful attention to all the suggestions made to me by the European Parliament. May I stress, however, that we are well aware that a number of texts necessary for police and judicial cooperation will need to be given a new basis, thereby enabling Parliament to carry out its role as colegislator.In the meantime, I hope you will understand why I have tried to explain our reasons for wanting Europol to become an agency on 1 January and to continue its work, and we have taken note of the progress that Member States have willingly made in terms of laboratory accreditation and the crime prevention network.Once again, I understand Parliament's position and rest assured that in the coming weeks I will, as far as possible, defend this great area of freedom and security that Member States will henceforth develop with Parliament's active support.\nPERSON127 : deputising for the rapporteur. - Mr President, we have had a very good debate this evening. I think it is the Presidency that stands indicted tonight for their absence. They have not been here, and I think they must bear the shame for it.I just want to make a couple of points. I agree totally with Sophia in 't Veld. Of course, we want a strong Europol in the longer term, and even a better, more cooperating Europol where that is necessary. We only have to look at the many problems we have facing our borders today - drugs, human trafficking, international crime and terrorism, to name but a few - to see the need for that.I think it was the spokesman for the PPE who raised a point that came very close to me when he talked about the rights of the victim weighed against those of the perpetrator. I think that this is something we have got to give very serious thought to.Very sadly, we so often see those who carry out the crime get more sympathy and more support than the victim who was on the receiving end of what happened. There are many areas where that can be shown to have been the case. There is no way that can be held to be acceptable. I believe that we must give more support to the victims, and I think that then clearly identifies who was the victim. No way can you have those who perpetrate the crime being given equal treatment with the victim.Anyone who believes that in today's society we can survive without cooperating is living in cloud-cuckoo land. That is the reality as far as I see it. We had a very plain example where I come from - in Northern Ireland - over the last few weeks, where cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in the south made it possible to apprehend, bring back and prevent entering the market millions upon millions of cigarettes. Do you really think that could have happened if there had not been cooperation - not just between them, but cooperation all the way to the Far East?Yes, my friends, we have to have a strong Europol, yes, we have got to work towards that and, yes, we must look to cooperate where it is in the best interests of everyone.\nPERSON128 : rapporteur. - Mr President, before I make my intervention, I, too, would like to extend my gratitude to Commissioner Barrot. I can only say that he has set the standards very high for his successor.I will not go into the substance, because I think we should have that debate later, but I will briefly come back to the procedure, because I would like to clarify one thing.I have heard indirectly, as it were from the empty chair over there, that there is a very good reason why the Council is in a rush, namely because we do not want to stop Europol working. It has to become an agency by 1 January.But if the Council were sincerely interested in the views of the European Parliament it could have been here. It could have started the procedure much earlier than the end of July. It could even have accepted the European Parliament's offer to work very quickly, because the Parliament always shoulders its responsibilities, and we work very quickly if we have to.We offered that to the Council by way of a procedure that would be in the spirit of Lisbon at the very least. We asked for one month's extension, but the Council was simply unwilling to give us that extension; and the fact that the Council is absent today, and has not been interested in talking to the European Parliament, only demonstrates that they simply do not want to involve the European Parliament; it demonstrates their insincerity.I regret that, because, by now, it is seven days, three hours and forty minutes away: we will have to work together. I would just like to point out here that, as has been said very well by one of our colleagues, this is not about our egos. It is not about the European Parliament being sidelined. It is not even about the national parliaments being sidelined. This is about accountability to the citizen, because it concerns very important decisions.We are talking about the transfer of personal data and confidential documents to third parties, about the data and confidential information of our citizens, the people that we represent. Those are the ones that the Council is accountable to, more than to us.Finally, I heard what the Commissioner said, but I would like to have a statement from the European Council promising - given that they have rushed through this whole package - that they will withdraw or review the decision as quickly as possible, within a maximum of six months, and then fully involve the European Parliament in a full codecision procedure and be accountable to the citizens.\nPERSON129 : Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for its work in relation to Europol, and I would like once again to state that this is not a question of hindering the process of transforming Europol into an EU agency.However, the question of what remits are given in terms of the relationship between the State and the citizens is, of course, as fundamental as it is sensitive, and one which ought to be discussed here in Parliament. In a democratic system, it is a decision that must be taken by parliament, and one which must be discussed in depth to give the final outcome sufficient legitimacy.I find it quite worrying that, as Mrs in 't Veld has already said, the Council is not even present to hear this criticism, something that I believe to be a fundamental part of any democracy. I hope that the government will finally take on board the Parliament's criticism regarding the work that has been carried out to date in the field of security policy.A debate on the rights of citizens is needed at parliamentary level throughout Europe, as is a debate on the effectiveness of our security policy. The European Parliament and national parliaments must play a more significant role in both.I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the signal we have given together here, and hope that it was unmistakeably clear and that the Council will also respond to it.\nPERSON130 : Mr President, I would like to express my deep respect for the European Police Office, which I certainly support. I hope that, as soon as possible, it will have available all the legal, human and material resources it needs to achieve its objectives and realise its full potential, under the Treaty of Lisbon.To summarise very briefly, what is the European Police Office, the new Office?It has ceased to be intergovernmental and is now a Community body, with a Community budget and under the control of the European Parliament. We should, however, consider what is least defined. We should ask ourselves what is most uncertain.What is most uncertain in the decision is control by the European Parliament. We cannot therefore understand or accept, Mr President, the haste that no one can reliably justify, and which is, in short, limiting Parliament's control role. This is the 'A' in this ABC, Mr President. We cannot accept the Council washing its hands of the matter either. Tomorrow, when we vote, we will ask the Council for a statement along the lines already referred to. It should be a statement that says that it commits to putting forward a new package of legislation under the Treaty of Lisbon, within six months.Finally, Mr President, it is neither reasonable nor acceptable for us to help to promote the very thing we are criticising. For example: six reports on such important matters cannot be debated in little more than an hour and a half, in a single afternoon. Firstly, we are talking about the crime prevention network, secondly about the forensic laboratories, and we are also talking about four reports on Europol. This is not reasonable.We have seen how important this debate is, but we have not been able to go into great depth because Parliament itself and its services have made it impossible for us to do so, as we are required to deal with no less than six reports at the same time.I therefore hope, Mr President, that in future, more thought will go into holding the debates that concern us and occupy us so much. We will put questions to the Council tomorrow.\nPERSON131 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Members who have taken part in this debate. I should, in particular, also like to thank Mr Barrot for having taken our concerns on board.Our proposed rejections are not unjustified: they are not intended as a simple 'no' to the Council. On the contrary, we should like to be involved, given that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force within a few days, and I consider that Parliament's role as colegislator is of fundamental importance.I had personally asked the Council formally to present a much more ambitious proposal on the European Crime Prevention Network and to do so immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This proposal was not presented. Therefore, it proved truly necessary to reject the proposal, and I believe that Parliament has the right to operate on the basis of full codecision, especially regarding such important issues as this.I thank Mr Nicholson for what he said concerning the roles of victims and perpetrators, roles that are too often reversed. In the few months that I have been in Parliament, I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism, while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime, but the organised crime that is at the root of it.It is impossible to imagine combating or preventing crime without considering the possibility of a more comprehensive operation to repress and prevent organised crime and the Mafia - as Mr De Magistris has stated, quoting the remarkable words of Judge Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia.This said, I should like to make a small digression as someone who unfortunately has had first-hand experience of these matters. All too often, there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator, but there are governments - and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter - which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other. Victims of terrorism are treated in one way, and victims of the Mafia in another.In my view, these differences and forms of discrimination cannot continue to exist, because such differences have absolutely no place in a Europe that aims to base its policy on innovation.\nPERSON132 : Please allow me also to join those who have congratulated Jacques Barrot for his responsible and excellent work. I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work.The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place on Tuesday, 24 November 2009.Written statements (Rule 149)\nPERSON133 : The Treaty of Lisbon substantially changes the institutional balances that were originally outlined by the Treaty of Maastricht concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by including, though with substantial exceptions, the ordinary legislative procedure relating to the area of freedom, security and justice.It is therefore necessary for any amendment to the measures implementing the Europol decision to be adopted within the new legislative framework envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political, such as the transfer of personal data.Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union's increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence. Even if the treaty has no immediate effect on the development of security and defence markets, it paves the way for the development of a more integrated and consistent security market, which requires legislative actions that are coordinated and therefore interinstitutional. It would therefore be all the more inconsistent, if not indeed harmful, to adopt 'political' amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision that do not follow the legislative procedure envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon."

"transcript": "PERSON296 : At the start of the sitting this afternoon, therefore, I asked the opinion of at least one representative per group, as I had received a request for the quorum to be established in accordance with Rule 149 of our Rules of Procedure. This request was based on a written request from forty Members. In fact, to be entirely honest, 39 + 1, because the eleventh name on the list is completely illegible. I cannot tell you, we cannot tell you, who the fortieth signatory is on that list.After a debate and having received the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I took responsibility and I also interpreted Rule 149(4) of our Rules of Procedure, which states that the Members who made a request for the quorum to be established shall be counted as present even if they are no longer in the Chamber.I would like to draw your attention to the words 'no longer'. It does not say 'are not in the Chamber', but 'are no longer'. This implies that they must have been there previously. The 'previously' certainly does not refer to the fact that they were present in previous months, but most definitely to when the quorum request was made. I therefore specified that before the votes I would check whether the forty signatories were present, even if I was having trouble telling you who the fortieth one was.According to the services, five of them are present. Having said this, if forty Members now stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established, I will do so. Are there forty Members who will stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established?\nPERSON297 : Mr President, could you verify whether there are 40 Members here, because it is very difficult to tell?\nPERSON298 : Mrs Gill, I think that, especially since this afternoon, I am beginning to learn Rule 149 by heart. You are referring to paragraph 5. It is the job of the President of the sitting, and him alone, if he decides to do so at any time, to establish that a quorum is not present. However, given the importance of the votes that we are going to hold, especially on the case of a person sentenced to death, I will not play this little game. If forty colleagues do not take responsibility by standing up, I will not establish the quorum.Are there forty colleagues who will stand up? I do not see them. Therefore we will proceed to the vote."

"transcript": "PERSON008 : Today we are commemorating the fourth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism. It is a day that we must keep in our memory in order to remember all those who have been the innocent victims of terrorism.The terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 -four years ago today - and in London on 7 July 2005 claimed many victims and left many families torn apart by the barbarities of terrorism.Just last Friday, the terrorist organisation ETA assassinated again. Isa\u00edas Carrasco, a former Socialist councillor, was shot when he left his home in Mondrag\u00f3n. I wish to express our deepest condolences to all his family. As President of the European Parliament and on my own behalf, I should like to reassure you that the victims of terrorism - wherever they are in the world - will never be erased from our memories. Today, we shall commemorate Isa\u00edas Carrasco and all the victims of terrorism, in order to assure the victims of the madness of terrorist attacks of our respect and our sympathy. They are and will always remain present in our hearts and in our work. Sympathy for and solidarity with all the families of the victims is a duty for all of us.The European Parliament is actively involved in the fight against terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks. I cannot repeat often enough that there is absolutely no justification for terrorism. We must therefore take a united approach in this fight on the basis of the rule of law and with all the force of the law.Ladies and gentlemen, please rise from your seats for a minute's silence in memory of the victims of terrorism.(The House rose and observed a minute's silence.)"

Sorry, I have the wrong one.This one is about qualified majority voting in the Level 3 Committees. This text is brought in line with what should be done to guarantee that host Member States have an important say in the group supervision, and it reads that 'the Lamfalussy Level 3 committees take decisions on the basis of a fair and appropriate QMV system that takes into account the relative size of the financial sector and the GDP of each member State, as well as the systemic importance of the financial sector for the Member State'. From then on it is the same text.\nPERSON116 : Mrs van den Burg, unless I am mistaken I do not think that you read out the correct text.\nPERSON117 : co-rapporteur. - Mr President, it is the second one. It was indeed about the deposit guarantee schemes. We tried to strengthen the present text by asking that these rules in the European Union be 'urgently revised to avoid arbitrage between guarantee levels in Member States that may further increase volatility and undermine financial stability instead of increasing security and depositors' confidence'. Then it says they should also guarantee a level playing field for financial institutions. Sorry for this.(Parliament agreed to accept both oral amendments)- Before the vote on Amendment 8:\nPERSON119 : co-rapporteur. - Mr President, also as an acknowledgement of the frantic search by EU Member States to rescue the banking system, but not in a sufficiently coordinated way, we have thought that it makes sense to introduce this amendment. It reads: 'whereas the increasing cross-border nature of banking in Europe and the need to respond in a coordinated way to adverse shocks, as well as the need to deal with systemic risks effectively, require divergences between the national regimes of Member States to be reduced to the greatest extent possible; whereas there is a need to move beyond the studies that the European Commission has already carried out in this regard and to amend Directive 94/19/EC as soon as possible to provide the same level of protection for bank deposits across the whole European Union in order to preserve financial stability and depositors' confidence and avoid distortions of competition'.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"

It was a question of my credibility because six of those seven amendments were refused in the ENVI Committee three weeks ago. There were no votes against, and I see no new reasons to change my opinion on this.The other reason is that we adopted a resolution on safety at work in January and I think that this subject is well covered there. I have no problem with the contents, but I do not think there is any need to repeat some elements in different resolutions. In any case, in order to have an appropriate structure to the text, I would like to table the following oral amendment, in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs. Amendments 1, 3 and 4 are to be moved after paragraph 32, amendment 5 after recital M, and amendment 6 after recital Q.

It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows.Monday:As Mrs Andrikiencannot be present this evening to present her report on the development of the UN Human Rights Council and the role of the EU, there will be a vote on this report on Wednesday, as scheduled, without a general discussion.Tuesday: No amendments.Wednesday:The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has moved to conclude the general discussion on the situation in Gaza with the submission of motions for a resolution. Mr Cohn-Bendit will speak to justify the motion.\nPERSON018 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the situation in Gaza. That we should discuss it here in Parliament is perfectly natural. However, we are calling for the Security Council to take a stand, we are calling for the bodies to take a stand, and for the European Union to take a stand, but we, in Parliament, we debate matters but we do not want to take a stand. I do however believe that, faced with the urgency of the situation in Gaza, it is extremely important for this House to give its opinion and say exactly what it wants, in order to end the massacres currently taking place in the Middle East. I find it unacceptable that this House should not have the courage or the lucidity to vote in favour of a resolution after our debate. That is why our group is calling for the Conference of Presidents' decision to be reviewed and for the debate that we must hold on the Gaza situation to end in a resolution, one that demonstrates the clear and firm position of this House, of a majority, so that the massacres in Gaza stop. We want a resolution; we must be aware that we have a political responsibility faced with the current situation, and this political responsibility must not be a mere debate, but a resolution, a resolution that clearly states what we want and what we denounce!\nPERSON019 : Mr President, we have, of course, given this matter a great deal of thought. Perhaps Mr Cohn-Bendit overestimates the significance of a resolution, but with the Security Council's resolution we have a basis which we should support and, as the President of Parliament has already said, we should require both sides to seek peace, to lay down their arms and to comply with the Security Council's resolution. I would, however, just like to add that this must be the gist of our resolution. If this is so, we can support it. In this context we would cooperate and in this context we would support Mr Cohn-Bendit's motion.\nPERSON020 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation of the Conference of Presidents is based on great wisdom. We have, today, heard a statement by the President of Parliament who, if I am correct, was supported by all sides of the House. This is an important basic principle and an important statement by Parliament. We will receive a great deal of information over the next few days: through sittings held by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by delegations and through communications received from the Presidency of the Council and from the Commission. Therefore, we are not in a position to effect a resolution today, which will actually correspond in detail to how things stood on Thursday.I spent two days last week on the Gaza Strip border and observed a great deal of the suffering of the people on both sides. I believe that a ceasefire alone will not be enough. The ceasefire must be linked to a cessation of weapons smuggling into Gaza in the future. The details of the negotiations taking place in Egypt today, in particular, are of crucial importance. We should not destroy this by a resolution perhaps shaped by emotions. Therefore, I am in favour of the retention of the resolution from the Conference of Presidents.\nPERSON021 : (Parliament adopted the motion)The deadlines are set as follows: Motions for resolutions 8 p.m. this evening, amendments and joint motions for resolutions Wednesday 10 a.m.Thursday: no amendments.\nPERSON022 : (DE) Mr President, I had another comment to make on the debate to follow on the gas dispute between the Ukraine and the Soviet Union and on the crisis... Russia!(FR) I apologise for bringing up the past, Francis; I did not mean to do so.(DE) As far as this discussion is concerned: we would just like to establish and hope that all groups can agree that this debate should include a discussion on the fact that Slovakia wishes to illegally reopen a nuclear power station. I only wanted to ...(Heckling)You are the right man for the job. You can keep quiet, lad. Quiet. It is you. I only wanted to be sure. We are in Parliament, lad.\nPERSON025 : Would Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Ferber please stop their argument now. You can continue it later. Anything connected with these debates can be addressed in these debates.\nPERSON026 : (EL) Mr President, as the question of Slovakia and Bulgaria is a serious matter, I too should like to request that you ask the European Commission, which is after all the guardian of the Treaties and the Treaty of Accession, to tell us exactly what is happening and why these two countries took this decision.\nPERSON027 : The Commission has certainly taken note, so this will be taken into consideration.(The order of business was adopted)"

Yesterday when we were discussing the Guant\u00e1namo prison, here in the Chamber, I and several other speakers were interrupted without mercy when we had exceeded our speaking time by a few seconds. That harsh treatment was meted out by Mr P\u00f6ttering and Mr Siwiec, the Vice-President replacing him later in the afternoon.Mr Schulz, the Socialist Group leader, on the other hand, was permitted by Mr P\u00f6ttering to exceed his time limit by far more than a minute. Now, I would not dream of insinuating that this was because Mr P\u00f6ttering and Mr Schulz are buddies - alte Kameraden as one might put it in German - but I do spot a recurring pattern here. Colleagues from big groups elaborating the political message the Chair wants to hear are treated with great generosity. Colleagues from smaller groups elaborating the political message the Chair does not want to hear are treated with great meanness. Now that is in breach of the Rules of Procedure, where it is clearly stated how speaking time should be allocated.I want to remind Mr P\u00f6ttering and all his Vice-Presidents -(The President informed the speaker that he had exceeded his speaking time)I was sent here to defend subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member countries and the President and the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament have no right whatsoever to try and silence the voice of 15% of the Swedish electorate.\nPERSON213 : Mr Lundgren, I am now cutting you off. You have exceeded your speaking time by more than half. I have taken note of what you have said.

This is the great difference. But you prove my point - thank you very much.\nPERSON215 : - Mr Lundgren, I am sure that you are mistaken.

Just to remind you, ENISA is the European Network and Information Security Agency, which we, together with the Council, brought into being five years ago. ENISA's mandate expires half-way through next year by rotation. My report proposes extending the mandate by three years, to 2012, which also matches the Council's decision.ENISA's aim is to contribute to Internet security. However, with the increase in Internet crime, this is not possible with the available staff and the limited funding it gets so that, in the next three years by which we have extended the mandate, we need to think about what tasks ENISA should take on in the future and what role it can play, and then we will need to provide appropriate staff and funding.I would ask you all, most urgently, to again approve this three-year extension and then to make an effort to get involved in the debate on the future of this Agency."

The rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, has been getting money from a recycling company or a waste-disposal company, which was undeclared, when she was actually rapporteur of this committee. I find this a little fishy, even by the standards of this House, so I do not think she was the right and proper person to be rapporteur for this report.\nPERSON125 : Mr Bloom, I cannot say anything about the circumstances to which you are referring. However, when you say something like that here, it is a very serious matter and you should be aware of the import of your remarks.\nPERSON126 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I made a full statement about this last night. Mr Bloom may not have been able to hear it because his colleague, Mr Batten, was trying to get the attention of the House on the question of the referendum and spoke throughout the early part of my speech.I made a full declaration at that point. There is a full declaration in the Register of Members' Interests. I have referred to this in the debates in the Environment Committee. I am a member of the Environmental Advisory Board of a company called Shanks plc in the UK and have been for the past three years. The Environmental Advisory Board includes amongst its members a member of the Green Alliance and the chairman of one of the EU Scientific Advisory Committees. The Environmental Advisory Board is solely concerned with the environmental audit performance of the company's sites within the terms of EU legislation. I am completely open about that and always have been.I feel that my experience on the Board has helped me put together a reasonable report which does not favour any particular sort of waste treatment. I hope that my colleagues will support me when I say that I have always been open about this and that I have tried to put together a balanced report, taking account of all points of view in the Parliament.(Loud applause)\nPERSON127 : Mrs Jackson, I have known you personally for many years and I have no doubts at all about your personal integrity. Furthermore, the wording of your declaration can be viewed and has been properly noted in the Register of Members' Financial Interests.\nPERSON128 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to make any comment on what Mrs Jackson has just said. I think, however, and this is something that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always called for, that we should have better regulation on the issue of conflicts of interest, given that this Parliament, as a co-legislator, will in the future need to be and increasingly today needs to be transparent and correct: not only transparent, that is to say, but also correct, with regard to its Members' conflicts of interest.- After the vote:\nPERSON130 : Mr President, I do not care for the way some of these votes are going. Can I suggest, in the light of our reaction to the French, Dutch and Irish referendums, that we simply disregard the votes and carry on as we wanted?\nPERSON131 : Mr Hannan, when you speak, it must be in accordance with our Rules of Procedure. I declare the standpoint thus amended to be accepted.\nPERSON132 : Mr President, I am sorry to interrupt the voting at the end but I think there was one error. We have been checking during the course of the votes and I think all the groups agree that you may mistakenly have announced that Amendment 27 was carried. Amendment 27 could not have been carried. I would be grateful if you could go back to that and ensure that it was rejected. The point is that you did not then go on to the next amendment.\nPERSON133 : Amendment 27 was accepted; Amendment 92 was therefore invalidated. We will check it again, but that is what we determined here. We can vote again on Amendment 27; that is possible.\nPERSON134 : (DE) Mr President, I just wanted to tell you that we can check whether you are allowed to repeat a vote that has already taken place, after you have announced the result. It seems to us that, according to the rules of Parliament, that is not possible.\nPERSON135 : Mr Cohn-Bendit, anyone can make a mistake and if I proceeded too quickly or was incorrect in what I stated, then I take responsibility for that. Naturally, I regret it, but let us not make a big deal out of it. We will look into it.\nPERSON136 : (DE) Mr President, as we understood it, it was an electronic check of a vote that had already taken place. To that extent, the intention was clear.\nPERSON137 : (FR) Mr President, I think that you are going rather too quickly. In the same way as you did on other days, and again during the amendment to the Jackson report, you said: 'those in favour', 'abstentions', and 'carried'. In other words you exclude the possibility of voting 'against'. Mr President, I know how much you like Mrs Jackson and that what happens here does not have much to do with democracy, but all the same, please observe the proper conventions!(Applause)\nPERSON138 : Mr Co\u00fbteaux, anybody can make a mistake, even within your group. If you accept that that is true even for you, then we are on the same level. I will try not to do it so quickly in future, so that you can see when you have not won. Is that okay?\nPERSON139 : (FR) Mr President, I beg your pardon, but I am undoubtedly the victim of a secret lobby. My machine allows me to vote 'for', but not 'against'. This could be awkward.(Applause)\nPERSON140 : Thank you very much, Mr Lehideux. I am glad that you do not hold me responsible.\nPERSON141 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that the chance you have given us to vote again on Amendment 27 has made it possible to put right an injustice, because in this way we were able to vote for Amendment 92 which, if Amendment 27 had really been adopted, would have lapsed. It therefore seems to me that this decision was extremely wise and democratic."

It resulted in the setting up of a Joint Committee, which has, in agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, come up with an agreement that now satisfies both parties: the European Union and the Republic of Mauritania.That said, it is now a matter of being able to pay the emoluments due to the Republic of Mauritania from 1 August. In agreement with all the political groups, we are asking the Commission if the vote on this report could take place not during this part-session, but during the July part-session. This is simply to allow our appointed rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Est\u00e9vez, to explain the exact terms of this report to us on the afternoon of Wednesday 25 June, so we can vote on it on the morning of Thursday 26 June, therefore making it possible to put it on the agenda of our next plenary in July.

It has to do with the fact that regions and local authorities, unlike private lobbyists, represent the general interest: it would therefore be simplistic to liken regions and local authorities to private lobbyists. Indeed, the statutes of many European regions and local authorities allow them to intervene in a much broader manner than is provided for by the Treaties in order to safeguard at Community level the public interests in question.

"transcript": "PERSON768 : The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Giles Chichester and Angelika Niebler, on the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0159/2008).\nPERSON472 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 2004 the European Network and Information Security Agency, known by the acronym ENISA, was founded. Its task is essentially to improve network and information security in the European Union and to promote closer cooperation among the Member States.ENISA's mandate is unquestionably complex. Computer viruses, spam mail, phishing and Trojans are real threats in a world of virtual data. Hacking threatens private and public networks. The damage done to our modern communication society is immense. Security is the Achilles' heel of our computer systems. This is where we are vulnerable and endangered; when I put it that way, you will understand how important this agency is to us.On the other hand, this agency does not have a large staff, but it still has this mammoth task to perform. This raises the legitimate question whether ENISA can actually perform its tasks in the way in which it currently operates. We have very often discussed, both in the chamber and in other bodies here, how ENISA might perhaps be further developed. The latest proposal from the Commission was that ENISA be merged with the planned European Authority for Telecommunications Markets. That proposal was not embraced by Parliament or by the Council. Instead, Parliament and the Council decided before the summer recess that ENISA's mandate should be extended for three years.The ultimate purpose of our question to the Commission is to ensure that this debate is structured over the next three years. By asking the question, we also want to grasp the nettle and challenge the Commission to state its position on the points we regard as critical. In its present form, can ENISA perform the tasks that are expected of it? Is the Commission thinking about replacing ENISA with another organisation? Is it absolutely essential that these tasks be performed by an EU agency? In the Commission's view, what general changes to ENISA's structure should be considered?I look forward to the Commissioner's reply. I am keen to find out how far advanced the deliberations are in the corridors of the Commission. We in Parliament, of course, shall subsequently be called upon to form our own opinion on the future shape of ENISA.\nPERSON474 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the honourable Members will know that in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the ENISA Agency, the mandate of ENISA automatically expires on 13 March 2009.However, the Commission believes it is essential to ensure the continuity of network and information security activities. That was a view shared by Parliament and by the Council in the debates on the proposal for an amending regulation extending the mandate of ENISA. Therefore, the measure extending the mandate of ENISA for a further three years is justified.It is true that the evaluation of ENISA launched by the Commission in 2006 identified a number of problems, but it also identified positive aspects of the Agency's achievement in the light of the limited means at its disposal. The Commission responded to the concerns identified by bringing forward a proposal for a regulation establishing the Telecoms Authority.We note today that the Council and Parliament agree that ENISA should be kept separate from a new body to be put in place as an alternative to the Telecoms Authority, and the Commission still sees the need for an efficient body able to monitor security and integrity issues. That is why it is important to continue the work of ENISA.However, I also strongly believe that network security challenges will require a strong, coordinated European response. Recent cyber-attacks in Estonia and also in Georgia - the serious cyber-attack there during the summer seems to have gone unnoticed - have shown that one country on its own can be very vulnerable indeed.I therefore call on the European Parliament and the Council to open, early in 2009, an intense debate on Europe's approach to network security and on how to deal with cyber-attacks, and to include the future of ENISA in those reflections.During the debate on the prolongation of the ENISA regulation, calls were made both in Parliament and in the Council for a debate on the goals of a possible modernised network and information policy, and on the most adequate means to achieve them. It was explicitly stated that the prolongation of ENISA should not prejudice the outcome of that debate. In order to facilitate such a debate, the Commission services will, in the second half of 2008, develop a questionnaire to be submitted to public online consultation on the possible objectives of a modernised NIS policy at EU level, and on the means to achieve those objectives. This will, of course, be done in consultation with ENISA and its management board.\nPERSON476 : Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament and the Council have approved the extension of ENISA's operation until the end of 2012. This three-year extension will enable further debate on the future of ENISA and the wider question of increased security of networks and information in Europe.In my view, the revision procedure ought to begin immediately. It should transform the body from a temporary foundation into a permanent one; above all, this must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in staff and an updating of the extremely important Articles 2 and 3 in its Rules of Procedure. This solution will allow the body to get to work as soon as possible under an upgraded and improved mandate.Let me remind you here - and this is the Commission's view, too - that only a European agency can guarantee the security of networks and information. I should also like to point out that today the overwhelming majority of partners agree that ENISA is the most able and qualified body to develop a new, dynamic European policy for the security of networks and information.In the past, ENISA was harshly criticised. I must remind you, however, that the evaluation report in 2007 was able to evaluate ENISA only in its first year of operation; as a result, the evaluation is no longer reliable or, of course, timely. Recent evaluation studies by independent bodies have restored the truth. It is essential for appropriate resources to be made available so that the body can operate more effectively.Finally, let me tell you that the Greek Government wishes to support a viable solution: it has undertaken to cover the maintenance expenses of an ENISA office in Athens in order to facilitate the body's work and operations.\nPERSON478 : Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the facts behind today's debate on the oral question by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on ENISA are certainly very different from when this question was submitted. For a start, the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to the extension of the body's operating regulation until 2012.At the same time, the European Commission's proposal to establish a European authority for the purchase of electronic communications has been treated with circumspection by the Council and the European Parliament. Instead, the Council and the European Parliament are in fact proposing the BERT recommendation, with fundamental responsibility for better implementation of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services, without getting involved in issues of network security or integrity.However, these issues are indeed exceptionally important, as you, Commissioner, rightly pointed out a little while ago and in your statement earlier today. You stressed that the recent attacks on Estonian cyberspace and that of other countries show how vital it is that we come up with a convincing and coordinated European response immediately.Now, this is precisely the role ENISA can and must play, once it is operating under an upgraded and improved mandate with clearly defined duties and aims and, of course, once it has the requisite means and human resources available to it.This time I hope that the Commission will contribute significantly and genuinely here by assisting ENISA in its work to reinforce the security and integrity of networks. This is vital to boost the confidence of companies and, of course, European citizens in European networks.\nPERSON480 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, network security - it sounds like a specialised field of knowledge, but the security of networks is influencing more and more aspects of our daily lives: mobile communications, the Internet, which is squeezing its way, rather like an octopus, into more and more areas of everyday activity, ambient intelligence - the computer intelligence that is built into our environments, be it to assist elderly people or to control complex work processes. All of this shows us that we are becoming more and more dependent on such advanced forms of technology. They rule our lives and the growth of our economy.How dependent we have become was recently demonstrated in Estonia. You mentioned, Commissioner, that Georgia was affected too. People are less aware of that case, but if we had needed a more spectacular example than Estonia, we got it there. We saw how a modern, network-driven economy suddenly became dependent on that factor, on that technology, how it was attacked and how its security really did come under very serious threat. That is also the reason why the Commission, in which Commissioner Liikaanen held the portfolio at that time, rightly recognised the need for a network-security agency. This is why we were taken by surprise when ENISA was evaluated after only a year, before it was fully and properly resourced, and the agency's very existence was called into question. That certainly shocked us at the time, and I am therefore delighted that we are conducting this debate here.Why did we call this agency into question after only a year? How do you intend, do we intend, to fashion ENISA's mandate in such a way that it can operate like an agency that deals on equal terms with the agencies that exist in the United States, Japan and China?I should like to thank you for your recognition, following the second evaluation, of ENISA's achievements. Nevertheless, day after day we Members of Parliament discuss this culture shift, this climate change that affects our economies, that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources. Every day we put our heart and soul into these efforts here. We all know that changing our systems is the only option. To that end we need intelligent solutions, and we need network security, for security is paramount. This is why I am grateful that we are holding this debate as a building block in the construction of a more robustly resourced ENISA and of greater network security.\nPERSON482 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in conclusion I would like to say that there is unanimous support in the Council, and broad support in the European Parliament, for extending the duration of ENISA for three years. Both arms of the legislature agreed to reach a first-reading agreement as soon as possible, in time before the automatic expiry of the current regulation.As I understand it, the Council plans to adopt the amending regulation as an 'A' point at a forthcoming Council meeting. The problem would then be resolved and, after the Commission has presented a paper on the basic problems underlying the cyber-attacks, Parliament can then take that on board and start a real debate on the future of our responses in that area.\nPERSON483 : The debate is closed."

"transcript": "PERSON130 : rapporteur. - Mr President, with regard to the four reports to be voted on, let me point out on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that the multiannual programmes in the field of culture, education, youth and citizen participation in community activities are some of the most important activities of the EU and especially of the European Parliament.Decisions on the choice and funding of the different activities covered by these programmes ought thus to rely on clear and objective criteria. Simplified procedures should be adopted to avoid unnecessary delays for European citizens.The four comitology reports, which the European Parliament is being asked to adopt today in plenary, aim to ensure transparent, fast and effective procedures. This will simultaneously strengthen the European Parliament's role in this field of procedures.The fact that these parliamentary proposals have been accepted by both the Commission and the Council is particularly satisfying and gives hope for future interinstitutional agreement.Finally, I would like to thank the Commission, the Council under the Slovenian Presidency, and the current French Presidency for the spirit of cooperation and agreement and for the way they have managed these four Community programmes."

That is why I am speaking today.My report is mainly about the protection of the environment, hence I ask for your votes in support of it. I note that the Committee on Fisheries has voted unanimously.My report contains different proposals, four of which are particularly important. The first is the completion of the marine survey plan; second, the long-term plan but also continuing discussions, at which representatives of all professions, especially fishermen, participate. Thirdly, there is the possible formation of a central coordinating body, as there has been a lack of coordination between bodies in past years. Fourthly, a schedule should be set up because, since 2002, when there were similar talks, some actions have been taken without a defined timescale.I suggest that what we decide upon should take place according to a timed schedule. Because I believe that all of us desire the protection of the ocean, I ask you to vote in favour and I thank you in advance."

"transcript": "PERSON767 : The next item on the agenda is the report (2008/2038 (INI)) by Eva-Britt Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Gender Equality, on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men.\nPERSON485 : rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and especially the shadow rapporteur for excellent and constructive contributions to the report.The Presidency of the Council has highlighted the importance of combating gender stereotypes. This is one of the six priority areas of the Presidency. Therefore I consider that it is important for us here in the Parliament too to give our views on the problem of gender stereotypes and how they affect equality between women and men.In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I would particularly like to state and be very clear that in the report I am definitely not recommending any new legislation in this area, neither at EU nor at national level. The measures I propose refer to national, self-regulating bodies which already exist and which represent producers, advertisers and consumers. These bodies should work to increase awareness of the importance of gender-stereotyped advertising. The Member States should also ensure that there are bodies to which the general public can turn with complaints. I also think that the European Institute for Gender Equality which is being set up should carry out research into how equality is affected by this type of advertising. We need to know more.So why is this important? It is important because advertising is everywhere, in our homes, in public spaces, in newspapers, in the media, etc. Of course we are affected, whether we are aware of it or not. Companies would not invest billions in advertising if it did not have any effect.Advertising and marketing today are not just about trying to sell goods or products, but about selling a whole lifestyle, a form of culture. We have to behave in a certain way and act in a certain way to live up to expectations of different norms. It is particularly important to combat this phenomenon where it affects young people who are seeking an adult identity, future education paths, etc. I want all people to be able to choose without consciously or unconsciously being influenced by various gender-stereotyped norms.Today it is impossible for an advertiser to make an advert for a product which increases environmental problems or hastens climate change. I have a vision that in the future it will be just as impossible to sell products which have a gender-discriminatory or gender-stereotyped message.I am also convinced that with increased awareness of the importance of advertising, consumers, both men and women, will start to refuse to buy products which use this kind of advertising. I am also just as convinced that consumers will favour companies, producers, which have a conscious advertising policy and which do not permit gender-stereotyped advertising. This will be an important success factor for companies and advertisers who demonstrate their responsibility by influencing and contributing towards greater equality. After all, this is the goal we all say that we share. This is one factor among very many, but it is an important one.\nPERSON487 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the EP and the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for addressing a very delicate issue on how marketing and advertising affects equality between men and women.Advertising plays an important role in the financing of the media. It reduces the cover price of magazines and newspapers and ensures that much audiovisual content is available free to consumers. This is important for freedom of expression and diversity, a question which is often debated in this House.What we have seen over the years is an accumulation of bans or controls on advertising - cigarettes, alcohol, fatty food - and soon there will be new rules for how car manufacturers advertise CO2 emissions. Advertising is a soft target because it is much easier to regulate it than to address the underlying problems, which are often more complex - though the report which we are discussing tonight favours further controls on advertising, this time from the subjective area of gender politics.As Media Commissioner, I recognise the underlying policy concerns, but I also wonder what will be the impact of these concerns if they are carried out on a whole industry and on the general public. As it has become more difficult to advertise because there is less money and because of all the bans, advertisers have reduced the role of advertising in their marketing expenditure. There are other ways to market products without advertising them in the media: product promotion for instance. That is very bad for media pluralism, because most of all the written press - the newspapers and the magazines - do not get enough income in order to continue to be published.The report does not take into account the positive aspects that support the objectives of the report in order to protect citizens. Let me give you some examples. Article 3 of the Audiovisual Media Service Directive contains strong wording on human dignity and non-discrimination in relation to audiovisual advertising. The Commission, I can assure you, will ensure that Member States' transposition of this Directive reflect what the legislator wanted.Neither does the report underline the valuable role that self-regulation has played. Let me give you an example here, too. You should be aware that it has been responded to well in cases of, and I quote: 'objectionable stereotyping', and I will give you a very concrete example. The fashion industry has stopped its 'porno-chic' campaigns, which stigmatised women as pure sex objects. So there are legislative measures in order to solve the problems.We should have, in this respect, a very realistic approach. Advertising is a short-form medium, glimpsed on a page or in a 30-second video spot. What the report calls 'stereotyping' may be just a quick way to link a product to a particular group of consumers. It can also reflect poor creative work. There is, on the other hand, good advertising and bad advertising, and as Media Commissioner I have to accept that the freedom of expression also includes the right to fail - even to fail badly - even if we do not like it. If I asked the plenary here to take a decision on that, I think that the right to fail would not be hampered.As the report acknowledges, there is no conclusive research that links stereotyping with gender inequality. Policy-making requires a strong evidence base, not just strongly-held views, and that is what we are basing our policy proposals on and why the Commission supports the positive recommendations made in the EP report. Best-practice exchange, for instance, among the regulators is something that we always encourage. Education, research and further debates should certainly continue.I would like to underline that for nine years now, as Media Commissioner, I have been pleading for courses in schools on media literacy. I believe that this would be the most important thing: if we could awaken the critical appraisal of youngsters in order to read advertisements, to reject the bad advertisements, something which is really not relevant to our society. I would like to concentrate on best practice, for instance I like the Spanish example of awards for advertising that handle gender issues well. That is the right way to proceed, and that is why we should accentuate the positive and see whether we can make further progress, because it is worthwhile fighting for this.\nPERSON489 : on behalf of the PPE-DE. - (ES) Mr President, true freedom ends where the freedom of others begins, and the freer the media are, the freer a society is; the loss of freedom begins precisely in censorship of advertising and continues into editorial content.Therefore, the European People's Party has submitted amendments to this report to correct a number of totalitarian aberrations which run counter to the principle of a free society.European marketing and advertising already exercise self-regulation and there is sufficient legislation in the Member States. Marketing and advertising are not only in the realm of the media, they form part of our daily lives and, fortunately, there are excellent professionals working in those fields who, for the most part, are aware of the sway they hold over social balance. Therefore, the European People's Party will vote against the amendments and paragraphs presented by the communists as they cast aspersions of widespread chauvinism and sexism among workers in the sector, and that is a fallacy.In the European People's Party we believe in equality between men and women, but we believe it must be advocated without giving anyone else a bad name. We believe that childhood and youth must be protected and that children and young people must be brought up by their families and society as a whole. Brought up with values which help them to be better people.I believe that the sectarian use of equality, which is the aim of this report, is a serious mistake and the EPP will not, of course, allow it. We very much hope that our amendments will be adopted so that we can support the report. Otherwise I shall abstain from the final vote out of respect for the subsidiarity of Member States and for respect for professionals in the marketing and advertising business.I do not believe that criticising national laws and overstepping the powers of this Parliament will be good for us because it will reduce our credibility in the future.\nPERSON491 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is not as anodyne as the late hour at which it is being debated might suggest and I want to thank Mrs Svensson for the work she has done and for her cooperation.Marketing and advertising are ubiquitous in our society and contribute to the creation of social constructs that sometimes have adverse effects, in the form of discrimination or the retreat into simplistic gender stereotypes. Advertising is certainly also a source of creativity and such representations are sometimes used intentionally for humorous purposes. But advertisers must not forget that they have an important educational role to play, that we must develop the critical faculty of young people, with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination resulting from what are at times degrading images based on gender that could put the dignity of the individual at risk.The purpose of this report is not to question editorial or creative freedom but to encourage the actors in this sector to improve existing self-regulation systems, to cooperate with the competent authorities to improve the codes of good practice and to be aware of their responsibilities in relation not only to gender equality but also to physical and mental health, which is sometimes threatened by pressures arising from criteria of beauty that are set as the desirable norm.That is why I ask Members to reject the many amendments seeking to delete parts of the text, since it would then lose all its substance.\nPERSON493 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I do recognise the problem described by the rapporteur. I imagine a reconnaissance mission coming from the planet Mars. They come to earth and by way of preparation they just look at advertising to get a picture of the people on earth. Then they come here and see to their surprise that women are not just interested in cleaning products and do not just sit waiting all day until their husbands come home from work, women are independent and intelligent and earn their own money and so are also consumers, and besides that there are other kinds of families on earth that you never see in the adverts, such as single-parent families and gay couples with children, and immigrant families, and, for instance, people in wheelchairs or with speech impediments. You never see them in the adverts. I certainly agree with the rapporteur as far as that goes.Having said that, though, I agree with the comments by Commissioner Reding and also my EPP colleague. There is still something like freedom of expression. Therefore I do not believe we should interfere in any way with the content of adverts. Best practice is a better idea. Of course I cannot name any brands here, but I am thinking of an Italian fashion label that has been breaking taboos for 20 years now, and of other products too.Apart from that the report is much too broad, because the title says 'marketing and advertising', when it also concerns school books, TV, the Internet, video games and much else besides. Quite honestly I think the EU should stay out of this.There is also something about adverts for sexual services. That is completely beside the point. Taste and morality can vary and I do not think we can impose them uniformly from the EU.Finally, if you look at the picture that has been drawn of women in advertising in the past 50 years, I note with satisfaction that women are much cleverer than we think. They do not let the adverts stop them from simply becoming independent.Finally, if we really want to do something, I have two concrete proposals. Firstly, if we do not like the advertising, we consumers go on strike, and secondly, I suggest that at least one woman should be appointed to one of the top four posts in the European Union.\nPERSON495 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the existence, both on television, including public television, and on billboards, of advertisements whose content or form degrades the persons appearing in them. Those in question are usually, but not always, women. Depriving them of their dignity, treating them as objects, depicting them as being on a lower intellectual level or as capable of arousing interest solely in the sexual sphere, leads to a lack of self-esteem in unprepared persons exposed to such material. It reduces their efforts to achieve life plans and limits their ambitions. Such advertising affects young people above all, which can make its impact more severe. It is one of the many results of omnipresent consumerism. For many people, profit - even if earned by indecent means - is more important than treating human beings as subjects with an intrinsic value that has to be protected. It is therefore important that advertising of this kind be restricted by legislation.\nPERSON497 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, equality between women and men is one of the values and goals of the European Union. The EU intends to establish that equality in every area of activity. It is unthinkable that the realm of advertising should be excluded. I therefore welcome the report by Mrs Svensson, who has addressed this important issue and presented a balanced report. You have my sincere thanks.Advertising affects us subconsciously. One major effect is the way it creates gender stereotypes. Discrimination in advertising runs counter to the aim of equality. The EU is not doing enough to eliminate sexism and discrimination in the media. We must therefore make it clear that Europe is a Europe of values. We do not want any misogynist advertising, any advertisements that degrade women into objects or revel in crude clich\u00e9s about women. The same applies, of course, to adverts about men.I would be delighted if, on the contrary, advertising helped to shake up our well-worn role perceptions, our images of men and women. Regrettably, however, the advertising industry has drawn up battle lines against something that should actually be taken for granted, namely respect, and particularly respect for women. I fail to comprehend why the advertising industry is raising such a storm in a teacup. I call it a storm precisely because it seems to have caught the ear, unfortunately, of many female Members of this House.For all that, we can surely agree, in fact, on the following basic principles: we need to be more awake to discrimination in the media, and we also need national monitoring authorities with which complaints can be lodged. Something similar already exists, by the way, in many Member States. This is why I cannot understand what all the fuss is about. I had even wished that we would go further in this report. For this reason I hope that we can indeed agree to support what is now on the table, for we need this report as a basis, and we should not water it down any further.\nPERSON499 : on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the report's many positive aspects in drawing attention to the negative influence of media, marketing and advertising that caricature and objectify human beings, discriminate against them and deprive them of their dignity, I must nevertheless protest at some of its arguments, which are manipulative and aimed at the creation of a modern egalitarian society devoid of ethical models. It is true that various hormonal and psychological therapies make it possible to experiment on people, but such experimentation causes serious trauma and should be banned, just as experiments on animals are restricted.Both masculinity and femininity, the dual form of the human somatic constitution, are personality-forming elements. It is impossible to change roles, since they are inscribed in human nature. Drawing attention to the influence of advertising is all well and good, but it would be better to postulate ethical-legal control based on prior acceptance of a universal value system, founded, best of all, on divine law.\nPERSON501 : (SK) Sometimes we are not even aware that the consequences of advertising policy have far-reaching effects on the retention of stereotypes, which means an almost insurmountable obstacle to the changes needed to achieve the defined targets, including the Lisbon targets.Despite this, however, we can also state that advertising as such has its great positives. We should realise that advertising policy, especially in relation to men and women, is putting a brake on the process of harmonisation of working and family life, since it very often presents a picture of a woman who is happily and smilingly on top of all her, sometimes conflicting, tasks arising out of her different social roles, very often performed under considerable time pressure.The problem is not just the maintenance of outdated stereotypes of the male and female roles, but also the further reinforcement of them, since the experts warn that advertising not only reinforces but also creates expectations. One of the most astonishing indications of this is the number of girls suffering from anorexia.Since marketing and advertising use or misuse existing stereotypes, it is pointless for the European Council to adopt resolutions combating stereotypes since they will be completely ineffective.The solution, however, will definitely not be some specific European code of conduct. The problem with marketing and advertising cannot be ascribed to the media as such. It is a pity that the report, in attempting to solve the problem, chooses a path which will either be impracticable or not achieve the target.\nPERSON503 : (BG) President, Commissioner, colleagues, I find the report very important and very necessary. The environment that surrounds us all the time is of exceptional importance for the formation of attitudes, conduct and approach to problems, equality included. Marketing, advertisement, media, Internet and television can provoke seriously both a positive and a very negative attitude towards the idea of gender equality.Without restricting the freedom in the activity of media, organizations and institutions dealing with marketing and advertisement, without imposing censorship, we should consider the negative consequences, denounce the presentation of women in an unfavourable light, as subjects provoking violence, sexism, or their being shown as a combination of \"hot\u201d female images and even hotter, tempting alcoholic drinks. Isn't this humiliating?Since we consider equality a partnership, we think that the tolerance of marketing and advertisement to this problems is equally valid for men. Advertisement and marketing should create a way to understanding equality, should reflect ethical models of equality of man and woman, not distort the philosophy of equality with the objective of profit. Thus marketing and advertisement should create an environment for social understanding, for social prospects.The report underscores the need of spreading in the media the principles of gender equality by programmes and materials intended for different age groups, popularization of good practices of respect, appreciation of the difference between the sexes, of non-discrimination. This will form a culture of equality and will create equality.\nPERSON505 : (SK) Advertising is an integral part of our life and it has an indisputable effect on the public's behaviour and the formation of public opinion.In the report, the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, makes points with which I agree. These are mainly points indicating the need to protect children and youths from negative advertising. Advertising the sale of sexual services and prostitution corrupts children from a tender age.I have a different view from that of the rapporteur as to how the defined target can be achieved. It is difficult at the European level for us to interfere with media freedom and not adhere to the principle of subsidiarity. I do not think that we will succeed in adopting a European ethical code in the field of marketing and advertising.Our anxiety about the young generation must be addressed mainly by parents and teachers. I am convinced that the main responsibility lies with parents and teachers who are in a position to teach children to use television and new technology sensibly and responsibly.\nPERSON507 : (PL) The resolution puts too much emphasis on the issue of inequality between men and women and on gender stereotyping. Negative stereotyping needs to be mentioned, and gender inequality is a major element in bad advertising, but it is not the only one.In the first place, many psychological experiments show how children - especially children, but adults too - learn aggression, negative attitudes and negative behaviour from television and the other media. Following on from what Commissioner Reding had to say about education at school, what I, as a psychologist, find important is that research shows people are convinced that television and advertising, in particular, do not influence them as much as they do in reality. Marketing and advertising in the media manoeuvre between information, promotion and manipulation. The problem lies in distinguishing between them. Where free advertising does not comply with moral, social and psychological principles, it is harmful. That is probably the most important point.\nPERSON509 : (RO) I would like to propose some practical means by which we could approach the issue of the negative influence of publicity on gender equality in Europe.From the point of view of the applicable European legislation, a key issue is the principle of the country of origin. This is also applicable to publicity, so that a production accepted by a national broadcasting board in a Member State must be accepted for broadcasting in all other Member States.We have recently dealt with clear examples of gender discrimination, promoted by publicity productions that could not be suspended from broadcasting in the European Union countries. Thus, I consider that measures of exception from the country of origin principle should be introduced, when it is found that the European pact for gender equality has been infringed by offensive media productions. Since we are discussing a field falling under Community competence, namely trade in audiovisual services, I believe fines to be enforced by the European Commission to producers promoting discriminatory imagines through publicity should be introduced.\nPERSON511 : (EL) Mr President, we are in favour of both the market economy and competitiveness. On the basis, then, of healthy competition, we want the truth to be told; products ought to compete on the basis of genuine facts.Freedom does not mean unaccountability, nor is advertising a ploy allowing anyone to show off their products. We were speaking this morning about tackling discrimination, and it is very strange that those who support the abolition of discrimination do not want to protect human dignity by applying self-regulation to advertising.I congratulate the Commissioner because she has often shown through her proposals that she is taking measures to protect minors and safeguard values with the help of the media and especially modern technologies.\nPERSON513 : (DE) Mr President, I support the view that parents and legal guardians bear great responsibility in the way they deal with children. Today, the business world sees and treats children as important consumers. This is why it is necessary to make them aware from a very young age of the power of advertising and its potential adverse effects. I do not believe, however, in the idea that we should regulate it uniformly throughout Europe.As the Commissioner also said, in the education system we must try to show children a path from a very young age, making them aware of both the opportunities and risks that are inherent in advertising.\nPERSON515 : rapporteur. - (SV) Thank you for the debate. I would like to clarify one thing - the report is from the European United Left, nothing else. With regard to the amendments, I would like to remind you that 53 amendments from the different political groups were adopted by the committee, including four amendments tabled by Mrs Herranz Garc\u00eda.Freedom of expression was referred to. It goes without saying that freedom of expression is sacrosanct. There is nothing in the report about any new legislation, either at EU level or in the Member States. That is a matter for individual countries. What we are doing in the report is focusing on the bodies which already exist, self-regulating and joint bodies in which producers, advertisers and consumers find the best methods together.The Commission says that more conclusive research is needed into how equality is affected. I agree with that and that is why this has been highlighted in the report. We need more research. We need to arouse critical thought! This is precisely what the report is about! Increasing awareness and thus also critical thought!\nPERSON516 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday, 3 September at 11.30 a.m.Written statements (Rule 142)\nPERSON766 : in writing. - (HU) The fight against stereotypes is one of the six priority areas of the Equality Roadmap for 2006-2010.This is a matter of principle, the practical impact of which is extremely far-reaching and thorough, since stereotypes create a scandalous situation for women and form a significant barrier to their success - whether it be in their job-hunting, their workplace, their career progression, their participation in decision-making or in balancing their work and private life. Stereotypes establish and maintain inequalities in every area of life, thus causing untold damage to the whole of society and significantly reducing the effectiveness of efforts to create equality.I feel that well-planned, coordinated action and campaigns against stereotypes are needed, important elements of which include the social consciousness that starts in childhood, education and the application of proper practices.The marketing and advertisements that appear in the media have an important role in forming the image that is created of women - the disadvantageous image contributes significantly to maintaining the scandalous situation, and at the same time this trend can be turned around by showing the reality, opportunities and skills in a realistic way. We therefore have to work on preparing these possible tools and measures, through which we can promote positive change. Similarly, it is vital that the existing legislation is applied appropriately.\nPERSON765 : in writing. - (PL) Mr President, Eva-Britt Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men is one of those documents aiming at intervention in matters that are not of the highest importance in view of the problems currently facing the European Union. In some respects the report is simply not serious.For the rapporteur, gender stereotyping is a greater problem than the brutalisation of media content, especially with regard to children. Given the existing advertising codes in force in the media, the claim that advertisements arouse hatred on gender lines is an overstatement. The report does not mention the growing problem of gender discrimination among EU citizens of the Muslim faith. I fear that, with regard to equality between women and men, the Muslim press is not monitored.That is a very serious problem for EU Member States to resolve. The proper relations obtaining in the field of equal treatment of men and women in traditional, historical European society do not require intervention at the present time. Individual cases of degenerate behaviour in this area can be combated by means of the existing legislation."

At that point we, as Parliament, pleaded for better provision of information to the employees involved or European citizens who move freely. At the European Parliament's instigation, after the Council of Ministers had determined its position, negotiations started, which we managed to bring to a successful conclusion.I should, above all, like to say a word of thanks to my fellow Members, and Jean Lambert in particular. We managed to work well with the European Commission.

This is the regulation to which that refers, and this is the implementation of it.We believe we have made considerable progress, not least in terms of the electronic means of communication, which hopefully will speed up the process for all citizens, but we in Parliament believe that we have added to citizens' rights within this process, that they are now entitled to much more information, not least in the case of those who have been posted for work purposes. We also believe we have made minimal progress on deadlines - although that is something that rests with the Member States.This is important: it now means we can bring in the updated regulation and, hopefully, this will work more rapidly and in the best interests of all citizens. Again, I would like to thank all colleagues who have been involved in this long, difficult but, hopefully, very fruitful outcome.(Applause)"

We are still left with the subjects of the efficiency, fluidity and safety of transport, and to these we are adding concerns relating to the people living near, and the environment surrounding, the routes. This sends out an important message.

We have put the issue of energy poverty onto the European agenda for the very first time and we have ensured the independence of the national regulatory authorities and given them an increased role to police the new system.We would like, however, to encourage the Commission and, in particular, the competition authorities to continue their work in ensuring that companies that own both generation and transmission systems play by the rules and do not abuse their positions.I would like to thank colleagues for all their help over the years."

"transcript": "PERSON125 : In July 2006 the Commission presented a strategy the objective of which was to reduce the general risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. The last element of that strategy is the proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery. The directive sets out the requirements with which the machinery for application should comply in order to limit the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment, the operator and the surroundings. Establishing these requirements will reduce the differences between regulations and the procedures followed in some countries of the Community concerning the application of pesticides, ensure a uniform level of environmental protection in the Community, and enable free flow of these machines in the EU market, which is especially significant for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are most often the producers of this type of equipment.The draft of the proposal and suggested amendments were the subject of discussion during workshops, at meetings with representatives of the Council, the Commission, shadow rapporteurs and interested parties, and during tri-partite talks. In view of the large technical differences between different types of machine - from simple, hand-operated ones to those operated by qualified personnel - some of the amendments were not adopted and it was decided that they will be contained in standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization at the request of the Commission. Thanks to this a consensus was achieved, Amendment 39 was adopted, and this position has been confirmed by the Council.I would particularly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, representatives of the Commission and the Council, the administration of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and interested parties for their help and cooperation. I propose adoption of the directive, which will contribute to increased protection of the environment, operators and their surroundings when applying pesticides.\nPERSON126 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rutowicz, for his work and efforts in processing this proposal.The Commission welcomes compromise Amendment 39 and is looking forward to the rapid adoption of the proposal along those lines.The Commission would like to make the following statement: 'To support the essential requirements included in Section 2.4 of Annex I, the Commission will mandate CEN to develop harmonised standards for each category of machinery for pesticide application, based on the best available techniques for preventing unintended exposure of the environment to pesticides. In particular the mandate will require the standards to provide criteria and technical specifications for the fitting of mechanical shielding, tunnel spraying and air-assistance systems for spraying for preventing contamination of the water source during filling and emptying and precise specifications for the manufacturer's instructions to prevent drift of pesticides, taking account of all the relevant parameters, such as nozzle pressure, boom height, wind speed, air temperature and humidity, and driving speed.'"

"transcript": "PERSON140 : President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, let me remind you that the Council has always examined the opinions and resolutions of Parliament with great interest and attention. At the same time, the Council has taken the issue of human rights very seriously, as evidenced in the contractual relations of the European Union with countries in various parts of the world.Under the Cotonou Agreement, a treaty between the European Union and the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, there have been more than 15 cases since 1995 when the Community has partially or fully suspended the application of agreements in relation to some of the countries for non-execution of obligations relating to the human rights clause.You will certainly also know about the sanctions the Council imposed on Uzbekistan following the Andijan events in 2005. Of course, much remains to be done in the field of human rights and respect for the rule of law and democracy in Turkmenistan.We will continue to push, in particular, for the release of all political prisoners, for free access of the International Committee of the Red Cross to prisons, for lifting of the restrictions on foreign travel and for freedom of the media in civil society. We are committed to taking appropriate measures in conformity with the agreement, including, if necessary, the suspension of the agreement with Turkmenistan, in case of a violation of human rights, as stipulated in the agreement.\nPERSON141 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission has carefully taken note of Parliament's concerns about the democracy and human rights situation in Turkmenistan. We welcome the statement in the joint draft resolution that the conclusion of an interim trade agreement would be a good first step that will allow us to engage more with Turkmenistan in order to promote further positive developments and cooperation.The Commission is aware of Parliament's concerns regarding the possibility of suspending the agreements. I recall the statement by my colleague, Ms Ferrero-Waldner, at the debate last month that both the Interim Trade Agreement (Article 1) and the PCA (Article 2) contain human rights clauses which constitute an essential element of those agreements. As well as these provisions, Article 28 of the ITA and Article 94 of the PCA will enable each side to take appropriate measures in case of grave violations of the agreements. In the Commission's view, these measures could also include the suspension of the agreements.The Commission undertakes to monitor closely the human rights situation in Turkmenistan, together with Member States, and to report on a regular basis to the appropriate bodies of Parliament. Should Parliament recommend taking measures in the light of reported grave violations of essential elements of the Interim Trade Agreement, especially with regard to human rights, the Commission will seriously consider duly reflecting Parliament's recommendations in its proposal to the Council.\nPERSON142 : (FR) Mr President, the declarations by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are very interesting since they prove the European Parliament right in calling for the signing of a new trade agreement with Turkmenistan to be linked to respect for human rights. The latter is a fundamental principle for trade agreements made by the European Union.However, given the huge number of human rights violations in that country, even now, I believe that the best way to establish this philosophy is to start by postponing this new trade commitment that you are proposing to us, and thus not to give our assent, which we are being asked to give today.\nPERSON143 : (DE) Mr President, I should like to say that, in its debate and its papers, Parliament has called on both the Commission and the Council to state that, if Parliament were to call for this agreement to be suspended or revoked, they would do so.The statements were very different. The President-in-Office of the Council expressed no opinion at all as to how the Council would react if Parliament were to call for this. The Commissioner merely replied that the Commission would give some thought to what it would do if Parliament made this request. My point is that Parliament's demands have in no way been met by either the Commission or the Council, and therefore I can only recommend that we now withhold our support for this.(Applause)\nPERSON144 : (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been debating the subject of Turkmenistan for three-and-a-half years in various committees in this House. There are European Treaties by which Parliament, too, must abide, even if we do not always like it.Today, we have managed to obtain, in the Council and Commission statements, the assurances that are possible within the framework of the European Treaties. The Commission and the Council have agreed to seriously consider following Parliament's lead when it delivers opinions and possibly even calls for the suspension of the agreement.As we all know, unfortunately, this is all Parliament can hope for within the scope of the European Treaties. There is one mistake we should not make, and that is to hold our relations with a country hostage in order to obtain more power for the European Parliament. I urge you to recognise the statements by the Council and the Commission. That was all that could be hoped for. Against this background and in these circumstances, I would ask you to support the signing of the agreement.\nPERSON145 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, if that was not on behalf of the group, I move adjournment on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."

For this, I should like to offer particular thanks to my fellow MEPs, the Council, the Commission, the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the European Economic and Social Committee and, of course, the large body of researchers behind it all.We now have within reach concerted European research, in the context of future cooperation between the 22 National Metrology Institutes. This will introduce substantial Europeanisation into the important field of measurement. In addition, there is to be enhanced cooperation in future involving the five Member States not yet participating in this integration. We have achieved this by means of Article 169, which we apply when coordinating national and European research funding. Each amounts to EUR 200 million, and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between the nation-states.Research in the field of measurement covers a wide range of fields, from diabetes to the nanotechnology or space fields, and will be important to the whole field of standard setting in relation to CO2 in future. So, then, I wish to reiterate my particular thanks to everyone involved. I hope that this will lead to enhanced European cooperation in this very important research area in future."

"transcript": "PERSON279 : Madam President, concerning personal statements, in the debate we had this morning with Mr Sarkozy, I made a number of comments about the European Union's attitude towards democracy. In particular, I talked about the leader of the Socialist Group, Martin Schulz, having made some disparaging and derogatory comments in the debate in June of this year. He was allowed by the President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, to get up and to say that my comments had been untrue and that he had never in any way suggested that the 'no' side could be linked in the future with fascism. I would like, please, to set the record straight.On 18 June, in this place, when talking about the 'no' vote in Ireland, this is exactly what Martin Schulz said. He said, 'The passion has migrated to the other side, the side which speaks ill of Europe, on the right wing of the political spectrum. It lies with those who speak ill of Europe, and who do so simply because they are afraid. In Europe, however, this mixture of social decline and fear has always opened the door to fascism.'Mr Schulz may not like what I have to say. He may profoundly disagree with what I say. However, I would say to you, Mr Schulz, when I get up in this place, I always research very thoroughly what I say. I never stand up here and tell lies. What I said, I believed to be entirely true. I am not asking for an apology or anything of that kind. I do this to put the matter straight, and I regret that our President, Mr P\u00f6ttering, chose to use Rule 145 to allow Martin Schulz to take the floor this morning but not to allow me to take the floor this morning, which in fact was the very point of the speech I made this morning. It is not a level playing field in the European Union. It is as though you are the good guys if you are pro-Treaty and you are the bad guys if you are opposed to the Treaty. That, to me, is not very democratic.\nPERSON280 : Mr Farage, your comments will be entered on the record.\nPERSON281 : (DE) Madam President, Mr Farage claimed this morning that I had said, in this House, that 'a \"no\u201d vote will lead to fascism'. 'In previous times Martin Schulz has stood up and said that a \"no\u201d vote will lead to fascism'. I have never said that - never! - and I would like to clarify this point once and for all now.I do not believe that a 'no' vote by any given population - like the Irish population, for example - leads to fascism. That is not my belief. That is now clear once and for all. I do, however, very much believe that we must all be aware that playing with the feelings of people who are plagued by the fears of losing social status is always dangerous if it gets into the hands of incendiarists. I do not know whether any of you can be counted amongst the ranks of the incendiarists. I hope not. I am very well aware, however, that such incendiarists do exist.There is one thing that you can be sure of, Mr Farage, and that is that I will fight against people like you, and your politics, for as long as I am physically able to do so!\nPERSON282 : Both sides have given an explanation and we shall now move on to the next item."

"transcript": "PERSON041 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur I wish to table three oral amendments: to Amendment 62 - on the voting list, if you can follow - regarding recital 12, I propose that the entire parenthetic clause from 'annual amounts' up to 'annual budget' be deleted.To Amendment 65 on the voting list, concerning recital 12c, I propose that the following parenthetic clause be inserted between the words 'parliamentary assistance' and 'cover the total costs': 'the annual amounts necessary will be determined within the annual budgetary procedure'.To Amendment 75, which concerns Article 131, my oral amendment is to add the word 'transparent' to the words 'reference framework', to give 'transparent reference framework'.These are the oral amendments that I am tabling to the House as rapporteur. I hope that they are accepted.\nPERSON043 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would formally ask the Commission whether it is in agreement in respect of all these accepted amendments.\nPERSON044 : Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is pleased that an agreement has been reached between the institutions on a joint text for a statute for parliamentary assistants.On behalf of the Commission, I can confirm today our agreement on this text, which preserves the full substance of our initial proposal. The Commission prepared this proposal in response to a request from the European Parliament to the Commission in a letter from President P\u00f6ttering to President Barroso. Only eight months after this request, you have now endorsed the result of the very constructive discussions between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. With this proposal, for the third time in 10 years, the Commission took the initiative of addressing the issue of a statute, and we firmly believe that this time we will succeed. We now have to use this window of opportunity. Therefore, I also give a commitment on behalf of the Commission to defend this text until its final approval by the Council.(Applause)\nPERSON045 : Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m, I am sure that Parliament welcomes your statement.We will now proceed to a roll-call vote to close an issue that has been pending for almost 30 years.Let me just savour this moment.- After the vote\nPERSON046 : rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I am grateful to the Commissioner, I would ask for your attention for a moment because I have to read out a political declaration, an institutional political declaration agreed on with the Council.'The European Parliament and the Council, notwithstanding the competences of the budgetary authority, agree that the transition to new conditions of employment of accredited parliamentary assistants does not in itself require an increase in the appropriations entered in the European Parliament section of the general budget of the European Union and intended to cover parliamentary assistance, with respect to the appropriations entered for this purpose in the budget for the financial year 2008, subject to indexation.The European Parliament draws attention to Article 69(2) of the implementing measures for the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament on 17 July 2008, which stipulates that the total expenses reimbursed to all parliamentary assistants may be indexed each year by the Bureau.The European Parliament and the Council agree that, where the Commission has to propose, pursuant to Article 96(11) of the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities (CEOS), an adjustment of the contribution to the unemployment insurance scheme, as a result of the inclusion of accredited assistants in that scheme, the necessary payments from the European Parliament should be financed by way of an appropriate budget heading and drawn from the global appropriations intended for the sections of the budget relating to the European Parliament.The European Parliament and the Council would point out that, in accordance with Article 248(4)(2) of the EC Treaty, the Court of Auditors may at any time present its findings on specific problems in the form of special reports or give opinions at the request of one of the other Community institutions.The European Parliament undertakes to consult the future body representing accredited parliamentary assistants with regard to any amendments made to the internal decision referred to in Article 125(1) of the CEOS.'This is the declaration agreed on with the Council, and while I would ask the Council whether it agrees - I think it is fairly safe to say that it does - I should just like to devote a couple of minutes to sharing a thought, an idea, with Parliament. We have concluded a piece of work which, as the President pointed out, is age-old and has been debated for many years. However, the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was given the task of having to consider, in just a few days, a proposal that came from the Commission but that had somehow been drafted by the Roure committee - I refer to the chairman, Mrs Roure, whom I thank - has done a thorough job. It is with great pride that I must say that the Committee on Legal Affairs has thoroughly investigated a problem that my fellow Members know is difficult.We have struck a balance regarding the free and fundamental choice of Members to choose their own assistants - this is stated throughout the framework - a balance that gives rise to transparency, that provides rules and that therefore changes this situation about which there was uncertainty. I have stood up for the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr President; I have also written a letter to Mr P\u00f6ttering, to say that, as the Committee had the duty and right to hold a large-scale debate, it has done so, and I believe that it has found the right balance. In the trialogue I must thank the Commission and the Council, who have worked together, but, above all, I must thank the coordinators, my colleagues and Maria Jos\u00e9 from the Secretariat, who has made an exceptional contribution, which we are consolidating today.I hope that my fellow Members will vote in favour; we will see in the next two years whether this legislation can contribute significantly to our parliamentary work.\nPERSON047 : Many thanks, Mr Gargani.I would also, as this has been the result of teamwork, take the liberty of congratulating Martine Roure for her excellent work within the working group, chairing it with great determinationI would also, of course, like to extend our thanks to our Secretary-General, who has been a formidable negotiator on this topic - and without his determination, none of this would have been possible - and also to the four most recent Presidents of the European Parliament, Mr P\u00f6ttering, who was keen to complete this matter, Mr Borrell, who enabled us to take a decisive step forward with the adoption of the codex, Mr Cox, who made it possible to separate the various statutes, and, of course, Mrs Fontaine, who fired the starting pistol almost 10 years ago, so that we could finally have this report before us today.\nPERSON048 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, this may seem like sycophancy, but my fellow Members will forgive me, since some may still not be aware that the person who put forward this matter within the Bureau in years gone by was in fact you, and therefore as you were not able to say it, I will. Therefore, on behalf of my group and of those outside my group, I thank you also for your work within the vice-presidency of Parliament.\nPERSON049 : Thank you everybody. I think that the new statute will serve as an example in other parliaments all over the world."

"transcript": "PERSON052 : (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that Parliament will vote for the first time today within the framework of the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny on whether to reject a Commission legislative proposal. As rapporteur for the Capital Requirements Directive which forms the background to this vote, I would ask you to support the motion for a resolution, which was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.This will allow the European Parliament to send a clear signal to the Commission. We are demanding an appropriate balance between matters which are proposed by the Commission in the codecision procedure and matters which are handled by the Commission alone within the comitology procedure.The Commission has made concrete proposals within the comitology procedure relating to credit rating agencies which go far beyond the technical aspects and therefore need to be returned to the codecision procedure.We must ensure that we issue coherent legislation. We currently have in front of us the reports on the rating agencies and on the Capital Requirements Directive and one comitology proposal. Our aim is to discuss everything jointly in the codecision procedure with a clear focus and therefore I ask you for your support.(Applause)"

A month ago Parliament's Baltic Europe Intergroup passed a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit, a matter of great importance to this House. We have not yet received an acknowledgement, never mind a reply. Could she perhaps raise this with colleagues in the Commission? It is a matter of great importance to this House.\nPERSON056 : Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, yes, of course I will follow up on that.

"transcript": "PERSON035 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to make a very small point but an important point of principle. The committee has come up with an agreement in trialogue, and subject to the will of the House that should go through. It is not a bad agreement, but it has raised an important issue of principle which I think I should bring before the presidency regarding future dossiers.It is important that we recognise that a rapporteur when appointed is not just appointed as rapporteur for the committee but appointed for Parliament as a whole. To my surprise, because the Council wanted to have a trialogue and the committee rules allowed it, a trialogue was going to take place, if necessary without the rapporteur if I had not supported going ahead with it.In my view, in order for a rapporteur to be the rapporteur for Parliament, Parliament should be allowed to express its whole view on a report before committing to a trialogue. It is called democracy, and I recommend the idea to the Bureau.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON029 : Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the agreement reached in first reading on the last of our four proposals on the alignment of existing legislative acts in the new comitology procedure with scrutiny.In the framework of this agreement, the Commission would like to make two statements, the text of which I will hand over to your services in order to include them in the record of this sitting.The first statement concerns a commitment of the Commission concerning the transmission of draft measures to the European Parliament when the time limits have been curtailed, and the second statement relates to the application of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny as regards the procedural rules for the updating of the Community blacklist of air carriers subject to an operating ban.Commission statementsTransmission of draft measures to the European ParliamentThe time-limits within which the European Parliament and the Council may oppose a draft measure, according to Article 5a(3)(c) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC, have been curtailed to four weeks or one month, in some provisions of the following basic acts: Directive 2004/17/EC, Directive 2004/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005. When transmitting draft measures to the European Parliament and to the Council in application of those provisions, the Commission commits itself, except during the European Parliament's periods of recess, to take into account the necessity for the European Parliament to hold a plenary session before the expiration of the relevant curtailed time-limits, and reiterates its commitments under the Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, in particular in respect of the early warning system provided for in paragraph 16 thereof.(FR) Application of the regulatory procedureThe Commission notes with regret the decision to apply the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005. It would like to stress, in this connection, that the implementing measures referred to in that article are procedural and administrative in nature and that they provide details of rules already laid down in the basic act. The Commission would reiterate how important it is to guarantee the highest possible level of aviation safety. It uses strict, internationally recognised criteria, applied objectively, to achieve this goal; this has always been the case when the blacklist has been updated since Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 entered into force. In the Commission's view, work on this matter should continue to be based solely on technical criteria, and it therefore feels that the procedural rules should, in any event, continue to guarantee a high level of safety and effectiveness."

"transcript": "PERSON275 : We are now going to sign, along with the Council, the legal acts relating to the Erasmus Mundus action programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries.Secretary of State for European Affairs, Minister Le Maire, Commissioner Figel' - the authentic father of the entire Erasmus programme - ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be signing an important decision, which makes it possible to extend the Erasmus Mundus programme, with the Council today. This is the culmination of the determined work that we have done in collaboration with the Council and the Commission. I would like to express my thanks, once again, to Commissioner Figel', specifically, for having pushed this programme forwards, making it possible for us, ultimately, to be able to set the seal on the programme together, the Council and Parliament, by signing today.This public signing will help to bring home the significance of European legal provisions to European citizens. The Erasmus Mundus programme will expand the Commission's original Erasmus programme, which was established 21 years ago. The programme gives students all around the world the chance to study in the European Union and plays an important role in the promotion of European higher education as a symbol of top academic performance.With increased funding - nearly EUR 950 million for five years - the European Union is now in a position to meet the growing demand for the Erasmus Mundus programme. This makes it possible for us to continue supporting joint programmes in Europe with grants for the most gifted students and professors from third countries. In addition, we will be extending the scope of the programme so as also to include doctoral programmes, and we will be able to offer European students even more financial support.Thanks to this programme, participants, and above all students, will become real ambassadors of openness and intercultural dialogue. They will help to bring about better collaboration and mutual understanding across the globe.Allow me, in closing, to express my thanks to the French Presidency, the Commission and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education - I am pleased to see that Mrs Batzeli, the chairman of that committee, is here today - as well as to the rapporteur, Mrs De Sarnez, all of whom worked intensively on this important legislative measure.I will now ask Minister Le Maire to sign the document with me, and Commissioner Figel' to supervise, as it were.(The Presidents signed the legal acts).(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON088 : rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cross-border trade in aircraft equipment to date has been subject to legal uncertainties. The new international legal framework is designed to facilitate the financing of aircraft equipment, namely aircraft, engines and accessories, by creating a particularly strong international guarantee for lenders (sellers on credit and institutions supplying credit for such sales). Basically, the new legal system will reduce the cost of financing aircraft equipment at global level and will help to save billions of euros a year in the aviation sector. Finally, the positive repercussions of what is now the most advanced regulatory framework in the history of financial law governing aviation will affect not only creditors and manufacturers, but also airlines, employees and passengers.\nPERSON089 : There was no debate on this report, and so the rapporteur is entitled to two minutes' speaking time.

Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a reply.We have now had another such report on the agenda.

I shall read it out very slowly in Spanish.It is a matter of replacing the words 'points out that the minimum requirement for EU cooperation with third countries must be compliance with international obligations' with 'points out that EU cooperation with third countries must be based on international obligations'.With this oral amendment, my group - and, I think, several other groups - will be able to support the amendment tabled by the GUE/NGL Group.\nPERSON125 : Mr President, I will read it in English as amended: 'whereas the effect of the joint operations coordinated by FRONTEX is to create an 'externalisation of borders', which could call into question Member States' compliance with the EU's obligations concerning the protection of asylum-seekers and refugees'."

We have discussed this at length in the course of many talks. The figures previously in the text need to be tightened somewhat, as we want the Commission to really take action.

I shall read it out in English again:'Notes with concern the situation of present and future young pupils in the European Schools in Brussels resulting from the delayed and still pending opening of the fourth school in Laeken and the current enrolment procedure leading to long and unacceptable travelling times for the children; expects the Commission, in cooperation with the Secretariat-General of the European Schools in Brussels, to present a revised enrolment procedure by the end of March 2009 with objective and comprehensible criteria (including the principal residence and already enrolled siblings), which will come into force with the next enrolment period'.(The oral amendment was accepted)- After the final vote:\nPERSON085 : Very nice, very nice too!"

We had a similar state of affairs yesterday with regard to emissions trading. Today we are rightly putting all the other amendments to the vote separately after adopting the overall decision; which I feel is right and proper. We did not do so yesterday, and, indeed, I cannot understand why not. The facts of the matter were the same, but separate votes were not held; which I do not consider acceptable. After all, I and 40 fellow Members tabled amendments yesterday, and I think I am entitled to see votes on those, too.\nPERSON097 : I am only doing my job, and I have only an executive function. I may have influence, but I do not have any real power.\nPERSON098 : (DE) Mr President, it would make sense for you to get together with the Conference of Presidents to consider the introduction of a general procedure.

He failed to make this statement on Monday. I had assumed that Commissioner Verheugen - who is not present here today, of course, but is represented by Commissioner Barrot - would make this statement, which concerns three points important to Parliament, in this House prior to the vote, but I have yet to hear any such statement. I wish to know the actual course of the procedure without delay.\nPERSON101 : The President was not informed about this, but I have taken note of it now. Mrs Gebhardt, when do you consider an appropriate time for the Commission to make a statement should it wish to do so - now or later?\nPERSON102 : (DE) Mr President, we usually hear this statement before the vote, since it forms part of the text but the text is yet to be officially presented to Parliament in writing. We do need this text officially first, therefore - that should go without saying.\nPERSON103 : Mrs Gebhardt, you say we usually hear this at the beginning, but that time has already passed.Vice-President Barrot, if you would like to make the statement now.\nPERSON104 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, in response to Mrs Gebhardt, I am going to submit the three declarations to you, and they can be added to the file.\nPERSON105 : Mr Vice-President, how long is the statement? If it is not too long, may I ask you to read it out, as Mrs Gebhardt has requested.\nPERSON106 : Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, there are three declarations: declaration of the European Commission on monitoring of safety aspects; declaration of the European Commission on the requirement concerning toys which are designed to emit a sound; declaration of the European Commission on the classification of books.(FR) I can read them out to you.\nPERSON108 : That was a technical explanation.\nPERSON109 : (DE) Mr President, under these circumstances, may I ask that we proceed to the vote, but not hold the final vote? This will allow us to have a look at the text and then hold the final vote in January if we are satisfied.(Members knock on tables in approval)\nPERSON110 : I gather from your reaction that you support Mr Swoboda's proposal. In that case, we shall now proceed to the vote but refrain from holding the final vote.- After the vote on the amended proposal:We shall hold over the final vote until we have heard the Commission's position in full.\nPERSON111 : - (FR) Mr President, I have followed all these debates from start to finish, particularly the ones on Monday evening. We must adopt a responsible attitude regarding the safety of our fellow citizens. They are urgently awaiting this legislation, which should make children and families safer. We cannot wait.On Monday evening Mr Verheugen gave a very precise account of the content of the three declarations that Mr Barrot has provided. This was merely a formal deposition of these declarations. As Commissioner Verheugen said on Monday evening, we can and must vote; this is our responsibility towards European consumers.(Applause)\nPERSON112 : Ladies and gentlemen, you were of the opposite opinion a moment ago. Let us then vote now on whether to take a vote.\nPERSON113 : (DE) Mr President, with the greatest respect, I should like to ask why the Commissioner cannot read out what he has brought with him.

"transcript": "PERSON093 : rapporteur. - (SL) It is clear from the joint report of the Council and the Commission for 2008 that some progress has been made as regards lifelong learning, but we cannot be satisfied with the achievements so far.Some of the greatest challenges are students dropping out of education at an early age, poor participation in lifelong learning amongst older and low-skilled workers and poor skills levels amongst migrant workers. However, a knowledge-based economy will need an increasingly better skilled labour force.I have stressed in my report that we need to improve the quality of education on all levels so that it can equip children and young people for autonomous, creative and innovative thinking and learning. Curricula need to be continuously modernised and the use of information technology increased amongst older people.Lifelong learning programmes must be related to the economy and support entrepreneurship, enabling citizens to acquire the kind of knowledge that will help them establish, run and develop their own businesses. It is important to take into account local and regional needs, potentials and characteristics.I call on the governments of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union not to cut resources for education at this time of financial crisis, because high-quality education that is available to all sections of the population is the best weapon against poverty and the best tool for finding a solution to the crisis.Thank you to all my fellow Members and to the Bureau for your cooperation.(Applause)"

The police did not allow this, however, as the visitors were wearing red jackets. I do not know who is afraid of red jackets. One of our fellow Members also had to remove his jacket in order to be let into the House.I would ask that we complain to the police, telling them that it is forbidden to obstruct visits. I should like to reiterate that the House's services attempted to let visitors with bookings into the House, but the police prevented this, despite peaceful conduct on the part of the visitors.

We are opposed to the procedure that has now been proposed. Our rapporteur, Mr Wurtz, has already said in the meeting between group rapporteurs that this is wholly unacceptable. The vote on the climate package, one of the most important votes this year, should proceed in the same way as all of the other votes. It is undemocratic and appalling that we are not voting on each report separately. We have to be able to vote on each individual report and we have to have the right to table amendments that we then vote on.Tear up this proposal and allow us to vote on each report separately and to vote on the amendments tabled. Thank you.\nPERSON068 : Everyone is entitled to express his or her opinion in this House, and the majority decides.\nPERSON069 : Mr President, at the end of the five-hour debate on the climate and energy package yesterday, the House was given a considered response on behalf of the Presidency by Minister Borloo and on behalf of the Commission by Commissioner Dimas and Commissioner Piebalgs. Despite the fact that 50 or 60 Members had taken part in the debate, they spoke to a House containing just four Members.I believe that this shows a certain discourtesy both to the Commission and to the Presidency, and reduces the influence this House possesses. I would ask you to take up with party leaders the question of whether we should consider sanctions on Members who take part in debates but cannot be bothered to be here to hear the response from the Commission and Presidency.(Applause)\nPERSON070 : Mr Davies, I fully agree with you in substance, but do make sure, including by checking with your group, that Members' presence can be guaranteed.\nPERSON071 : (DE) Mr President, I should like to make a request further to yesterday's debate with the French Presidency. There are group chairmen with important things to say in this important debate, which is only right and proper. Yet there are also group chairmen, always the same ones, who overrun by one or two minutes as a general rule.Perhaps this time could simply be deducted from their group time, as it does not involve subsequently altering what was actually the correct allocation?"

"transcript": "PERSON084 : rapporteur. - Mr President, as rapporteur, I had wanted to speak before my report, but I thank you for the opportunity to speak now, because it is important for all our sakes that a couple of things are put on the record.There is probably one issue that would unite all of us in this Chamber here this morning, and that is that first-reading agreements do justice neither to respecting parliamentary procedure nor to the substance of the legislation, especially when the issue is very complex and technical.(Applause)First-reading agreements must, therefore, be rare and the exception, and only exceptional circumstances deserve such an exceptional response.My second procedural point is that there is no legal provision for the involvement of Heads of State in the codecision process.(Applause)While aspects of the climate package were on the agenda at last week's summit meeting, and a requirement from that summit that any future revisions on amendments to aspects of EU ETS be available to be considered by future summits, at the subsequent trialogue on Saturday morning in Brussels, I added, with the full support of all the shadow rapporteurs, a new recital to my report - subsequent to the summit - which was then accepted by COREPER on Saturday afternoon. That recital emphasised the unique and transformative nature of EU ETS legislation, but stated that this consultation with Heads of State and Government must in no way be taken as a precedent for any other legislation.It has been an epic legislative journey. I should like to thank Commissioner Dimas and his team, Minister Borloo and his team, with particular thanks to Ambassador L\u00e9glise-Costa for his enormous body of work. I should like to thank the staff of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - and allow me to single out Virpi K\u00f6ykk\u00e4 for her Trojan work - all our group staff, my personal assistant, Kavi, for her untiring work but, above all, my fellow shadow rapporteurs and their staff for a very good cooperative body of work.(Applause)\nPERSON085 : I would like to take this opportunity at the end of nearly a year's work to add my thanks to all participants. I would especially like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. I will not repeat what has been said by the rapporteur Avril Doyle. A truly exceptional situation requires exceptional measures and the French Presidency has made a truly exceptional effort towards achieving a compromise. I firmly believe that the fact that the climate package is disliked by both the more ambitious and the less ambitious proves that a compromise has truly been achieved.\nPERSON086 : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that the European Parliament has been extremely cooperative with the Council, and also when I state officially that the way in which we have reached a decision on this must be the exception rather than the rule, and that, in future, we must insist on a first reading here in principle, in order to make Parliament's position clear.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON089 : Very briefly, Mr President, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members and congratulate them on this triumph, which belongs to all the groups in this House. This is a victory for Parliament as a whole.(Applause)I must thank two million European doctors and a million medical students for the work they have done, and I must also thank the European Trade Union Confederation and all the national trade unions, who have worked so hard.Mr President, it is important to remind the Council that this is not a setback, but rather an opportunity to rectify a wrong decision. It should see it as an opportunity to bring our agenda closer to that of the citizens. We must ask the Commission to don its referee's outfit and take off the Council shirt that it has been wearing these last three years. Once it has its referee's shirt on, let us go to conciliation, so that reconciling work and family life can become a reality, together with the social Europe.(Loud applause)\nPERSON090 : (SV) I would like to say a sincere thank you to Alejandro and everyone else who has worked on this issue. I do not see the Council here today. We have tried to get negotiations with the Council under way, but they have been unwilling to come to the negotiating table. Now we see a large majority here in Parliament. Let us now come to the table so that we can produce a good Working Time Directive. Now we will know the opinion of Parliament with a large majority."

"transcript": "PERSON077 : (DE) Mr President, my justification is as follows. Unfortunately, no plenary debate, the result of which we could have taken to the trialogue, was held on ETS. Trialogue negotiations merely on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are not representative of Parliament. Now, we are supposed to endorse the amendments to the Commission's proposal; but what we are supposed to be deciding on today matches the Council paper one-to-one. There is not a single alteration by Parliament, even so much as a comma. What is the reason for this time pressure? After all, we are talking about a period from 2013 onwards.With the ETS proposal in its current form, inconsistencies and ballooning costs will catch up with us. The subject of emissions trading is the most important industrial policy decision for years, if not decades, to come. We are not prepared to hand in our democratic right of codecision at the Parliament cloakroom. After all, what is it that many Members have successfully fought for in this House for almost 30 years? Have they fought to see climate policy left almost entirely to the Council through a simplified procedure? As an elected parliament, we wish to engage in democratic debate and to do so specifically in view of the consequences of our actions. Thank you very much."

Can you just confirm that again, please?\nPERSON156 : Yes, you are correct Mr Jarzembowski: Amendment 12 falls.\nPERSON157 : (DE) Mr President, this second amendment can absolutely be viewed as complementary. There is no contradiction. The two amendments do not preclude one another.(Uproar in the Chamber)\nPERSON158 : Could the rapporteur, Mr Albertini, give us his opinion?\nPERSON159 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what our coordinator, Mr Jarzembowski, said: Amendment 12 falls."

{
"transcript": "PERSON173 : (NL) I wish to raise a point of order based on Article 168(2). Our group has submitted an amendment on the change in the legal base, and a number of other groups have done likewise. The change means that now only Article 95 on the internal market, and thus only economic interests, are included as a legal base and not Article 152 on public health, in which the patient is taken as the starting point.In principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety asked for an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs, but the opinion was requested solely on the basis of the original proposal from the Commission. In the Bowis report, it is now clear that a change has been made whereby patients' rights are also mentioned in this report, and therefore the legal base has also changed. These amendments have, however, been declared inadmissible and therefore the fundamental change which Parliament wishes to make - in other words from an exclusive market orientation to including patients' rights - is in trouble. I would like to ask that the report be referred back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.\nPERSON174 : Mrs Liotard, we will now vote on Amendment 158, which is a motion for rejection, and once we have that result I will respond to your observation.I should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting.Therefore, I propose that the vote on the admissibility of these amendments should take place at the end, since at that point the Presidency will have the facts it needs to decide whether or not they are admissible. Otherwise, we would have to decide now without sufficient information.Therefore, if the honourable spokesmen agree, voting will be taken on these amendments at the end.\nPERSON175 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I agree with that proposal, but, just for the sake of clarity, could you mention those amendments covered by the legal base - 159, 119 etc.? The 'etc.' should also include the recital, which is Amendment 126.\nPERSON176 : We will therefore vote on 80 amendments from the appropriate committee, and we are aware that Mr Bushill-Matthews wishes to table an oral amendment to Amendment 100.- Before the vote on Amendment 100:\nPERSON177 : rapporteur. - Mr President, apologies to colleagues for introducing it at this late stage, but the reason is one of simple clarification.Amendment 100 refers to the responsibility of Member States to exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals. This is absolutely appropriate, but it has been brought to my attention at the last minute that this could be construed as saying that if such health professionals were involved in any traffic offences, for example, then Member States would have a responsibility to share information about that. That clearly is not the intention of the amendment and so, for clarification, the wording proposed would now read: 'Member States shall, immediately and proactively, exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals where they impact upon their registration or their right to provide services'. So this is purely a matter for clarification.\nPERSON178 : So far, in voting on this report, we have voted on a series of amendments affecting Articles 15, 16 and 17. The adopted amendments affecting those articles are the following: 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and 135.During the debate, Commissioner Vassiliou said that she would be prepared to review the legal base if she felt there were reasons to do so, which would depend on the amendment of the directive. We must decide on the admissibility of Amendments 159, 119, 116, 125 and 126.1, in order to ensure that the final text adopted by Parliament corresponds with the legal base.Taking into account what the Commissioner has said, and the fact that the appropriate committee voted on these amendments, that is, the appropriate committee and as such, the chair of the appropriate committee, considered them to be admissible; since he allowed them to be voted on, and also taking into account all that we have voted on today in relation to Articles 15, 16, and 17, I note that the directive has changed direction.Taking all of this into account, the Presidency considers the amendments admissible, and we shall now proceed to vote on them.\nPERSON179 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I accept your ruling - it is your right to make such a ruling - but because earlier Ms Liotard said that we would need to have a dual base, because, otherwise, if it was only the internal market, that meant we would only be voting on economic issues, without trying to open up the debate again. I would just correct her to say the single legal base that we currently have is not just economic: it is about freedom of choice for patients' rights. Therefore, our group will be voting against a dual legal base, both for these original amendments, and indeed the recital. I would encourage other colleagues to put the patients first.\nPERSON180 : Mr President, very briefly, I am trying to be helpful, but am getting hungry. These are important votes and it is a very full agenda and I have every sympathy with you.I have just been down to the press room and I note that eight journalists are actually listening to the vote - others may be watching on the screens, where every single vote is being broadcast. I therefore think that to read out the result of every vote is not necessary.(Applause)\nPERSON181 : Mr McMillan-Scott, up until now we have accommodated the speakers. From now on, we are going to move things along more swiftly and thus satisfy everyone.- After the vote:\nPERSON182 : rapporteur. - Mr President, it was because of the last intervention - which was very well-intentioned - that you omitted your normal practice, which was to thank the rapporteur. I am sure that you would wish to do that, especially in his absence.\nPERSON183 : It is indeed an appropriate moment to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work, and to wish him a speedy and happy recovery."

Otherwise we have to vote on the corresponding part of Amendment 60.\nPERSON147 : Thank you Mrs \u0162ic\u0103u, we take due note of your observation.- Before the vote on Amendments 109 and 124:\nPERSON148 : rapporteur. - Mr President, we have to vote on Amendments 109 and 124 too - the corresponding part."

For Parliament's vote to comply, it is better for you to reject the amendments, except in the case of the votes on Amendment 172, corresponding parts. I wish, also, to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Klinz, and all of those who worked on this important issue."

I am not doing it today because the Association of European Journalists has asked that we detail the votes. If we do not, the result cannot be duly recorded, and they rightly state that if they do not know the result of the vote, they cannot make a political assessment as to the position of the House."

"transcript": "PERSON162 : Mr President, I am sorry to trouble colleagues in a long voting session, but it has been newly marked on the voting list that Amendment 80 to a recital falls if Amendment 37 is passed. The first half of the amendment is exactly the same but the new bit - the second part - is consistent. Amendment 81, which is the corresponding amendment to the article, is not marked as falling when the corresponding article amendment, 55, is passed. Therefore, I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37, if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81.\nPERSON163 : Thank you, Mrs Bowles. It is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley.\nPERSON164 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I do not think this can be added as an addition. It should be taken separately."

There is no reason to justify why we would choose not to grant discharge or to delay discharge now that we have granted it. So that we can keep things consistent, I propose that our group support the Socialist Group's proposals and vote in favour of the next four amendments."

"transcript": "PERSON082 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of the ALDE Group, with regard to the Kirkhope report. Pursuant to Rule 168, the ALDE Group would like to make a request for referral back to committee. To be clear, there is no intention of breaking up the compromise package with the Council as such, but my group does believe that a more extensive debate on the definition of a parent carrier should take place.The Commission is working on a formal notice, which is most welcome. However, that does not give us the 100% clarity we need at this very moment. A proper debate should be allowed for, as well as decent consultation of our legal services. There is no rush to put this matter to the vote at this very moment.\nPERSON083 : Mr President, I am happy to speak in favour of the ALDE Group motion to refer this back to committee. In my long years in this Parliament I cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one. We are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on. Yet many Members are unsure. Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation, made even more complex by the intervention of the Council.There is great uncertainty, great unease across a wide spectrum of this Chamber, which is why I believe we need to reassess, re-evaluate and examine more carefully the implications of these proposals back in the Committee on Transport. It is about getting it right, not about doing it quickly. By doing this, we will not be creating problems; we will be acting responsibly as legislators, defending Parliament's right to work at its pace, not at a pace dictated to it by industry lobbyists and the Council of Ministers.\nPERSON084 : (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Simpson has just said is really quite abstruse; indeed, he turns the whole matter on its head. There are certain industries which attempt to block legislation in the interests of their companies. May I say this: with this code of conduct, our intention is to improve consumers' rights. We need to strengthen consumer rights so that we get fair offers from the computerised systems.We vigorously reject these delaying tactics on the part of the Socialists, who are attempting to wreck the compromise with the French Government and bring about its collapse during this legislative term. I would urge you to reject the referral back to committee.\nPERSON085 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I urge us not to refer this back to the committee. I think this is an unnecessary, and a potentially damaging, delaying tactic in the interests of the consumers of Europe, whom we represent. The first-reading agreement was struck in June with Council and Commission, after comprehensive debate and support in my - Transport - Committee. My shadow rapporteurs were fully involved with the process throughout and, as far as I am concerned, agreed the outcome.Two presidencies - the Slovenian and French - have both cooperated fully with me in this matter, and I do not understand why more time is now needed to debate or scrutinise this vital measure. The fairest and most democratic way to proceed is to vote now on the agreement. Many of the people who are now protesting did not bother to come to the debate last night when Commissioner Mandelson, at my request, clarified to Parliament the assurances that a formal notice will be published in the Official Journal before the entry into force of this regulation, giving a clear interpretation of the regulation from the Commission's point of view and very concrete and strict criteria (which happens on competition issues) to enforce these measures, in the interests of the consumers of Europe. I do not think that the consumers will understand these protests if we do not proceed to bring this measure forward. I therefore ask you, sincerely - all of you - to support me and the hard work that all of us have done across political groups to bring this matter through as quickly as possible.(Parliament rejected the motion for referral back to committee)"

"transcript": "PERSON253 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose putting these amendments at the end of the resolution. I apologise for doing so at the last moment, but it has to do with the UN moratorium on the death penalty, on which Parliament has already expressed a view on three occasions. That is why I believe a purely oral amendment to be acceptable.The two paragraphs I am proposing are as follows. I shall read them out very slowly in English:'Calls for the presentation of a resolution, at the next UN General Assembly, with a request to all countries who retain the death penalty to make available to the UN Secretary-General and to public opinion all information on capital punishment and executions, so as to overcome the state secret on the death penalty, which is also a direct cause of a greater number of executions'.The second paragraph is as follows:'Calls for the new resolution to foresee the figure of a Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, with the task of monitoring the situation, ensuring maximum transparency in the capital punishment system and favouring an internal process directed at the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the moratorium on executions'.(IT) I realise that this is, let us say, an additional subject on the issue of Iran, but it is also an issue on which rapid action is needed. I therefore ask you to accept this addition to our resolution.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)\nPERSON257 : author. - Mr President, the two amendments relate firstly to Article 9. We have a specific request from the UNHCR that it not be mentioned in the resolution. I think that this is absolutely acceptable and, according to this amendment, I ask for the words 'starting to notably work together with the UNHCR and others' to be deleted. Please note that in this amendment we also include Mr Hutchinson's oral amendment, in which he also asked for the opposition members to be included.Concerning recital K, we also had the same request in connection with the same principle that I have already mentioned. Here the words that we ask to be deleted from the resolution are 'under Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention'. It should also be noted here that we are also including Mr Kelam's oral amendment. Given the fact that this is a specific request from the UNHCR, I insist that we should take them into consideration.\nPERSON258 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I believe that what has just been said should be corrected. I can guarantee to this House that the United Nations High Commissioner has not at any time suggested this nor is he in agreement with what has just been said by our fellow Member. I therefore call on the House not to vote for what is being proposed. This would call into question the most important point, as underlined by the Commissioner, which is the protection offered by the Geneva Convention to prisoners in Camp Ashraf. We should therefore not accept this amendment as tabled. I must also point out that this would be in total contradiction to what was proposed by my colleague, Mr Hutchinson, and also our fellow Member from the Group of the European People's Party. I therefore vehemently reject this oral amendment.\nPERSON259 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would just like to say that our Group is also opposed to this oral amendment and is of the opinion that the Convention should continue to be mentioned, which is what was negotiated at the beginning of the week.\nPERSON260 : Mr President, I am really against joining, in recital K, my oral amendment, which is to replace 'ex-members' with 'associates', with deletion of the mention of the Geneva Convention. The Commissioner has just confirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies as well to the inhabitants of Ashraf, so I would like to ask you to support the first part of this amendment, which is the same as Mr Hutchinson's, but to oppose deletion of the mention of the Geneva Convention.\nPERSON261 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I want to join with the last two speakers, as the UEN Group is also against any changes to the existing oral amendments printed in the files.\nPERSON262 : author. - (FR) Mr President, I simply wish to confirm that we shall not be supporting the amendment that has been tabled here by our fellow Member, but that we have tabled an oral amendment to Article 9 that takes the same line as that put forward by the Member in question and that we shall of course be standing by this.(The oral amendments tabled by Mr Romeva i Rueda were not accepted. The oral amendments tabled by Mr Kelam and Mr Hutchinson were accepted.)"

I would like to remind you that the Commission has two years to comply with Parliament's request and that, thanks to a compromise, it will be very clear in today's vote that Parliament almost unanimously supports this.It is now time for the Commission to make an immediate start on its work on an overhaul so that nanotechnology can be regulated in a way that protects citizens."

We only managed 387 of the 395 votes cast. Due to the absence of many fellow MEPs, we have had to break our agreement with the Council.I should therefore like to ask the Bureau and Parliament's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before Parliament goes into recess after 7 May, so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part-session.\nPERSON139 : I must say, Mr Staes, that we had already considered this issue, and that we are indeed going to look at this because it is a real issue and a real problem."

It was under these circumstances that we tabled Amendment 2, so I am quite surprised that well-informed experts have told me that on the PPE list there was a minus against this amendment, and I would like to give Mr Langen the opportunity to correct the PPE list.\nPERSON143 : (DE) Madam President, there is no reason for me to explain how my group's voting list is put together.

I think that it would be very important for the Council to make Member States aware of the content of this report. This would help, to a large extent, to also make the Council's and other institutions' discharge procedure work successfully. This is why I am suggesting that the postponement of the Council's autumn discharge procedure should only be accepted, provided that the Council also puts this report on its agenda. This would be extremely important to ensure that the Council also accepts those regulations which are pending and would guarantee transparency in the spending of European funds.

These boats were carrying people from North and sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the refugees were rescued by the Egyptian and Libyan authorities, and some bodies have been recovered, but hundreds of people are still missing. I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to say how deeply shocked and saddened we are by this event.Over the last two years, the European Union has been experiencing an increase in immigration via the Mediterranean, and the economic crisis means that we can expect to see significantly more people fleeing poverty in Africa.The large numbers of refugees that tragically lose their lives when attempting to reach the European Union threaten to turn the Mediterranean into a huge open-air graveyard; it is up to us to find solutions to put an end to these tragedies.I would ask you now to observe a minute's silence in memory of the dead.(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)Thank you."

"transcript": "PERSON017 : The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 20 November 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows:WednesdayThe Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance propose postponing both the voting on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic.\nPERSON018 : Mr President, our request is based on a very clear fact known to everyone. At the end of last May, an official delegation from our Parliament, representing all political groups, went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza.On the basis of what they observed on the ground, at the end of this visit, they unanimously adopted a statement. This statement includes the following:'We strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations'.(FR) Since then, no such significant signs have been apparent, quite the contrary. This is why we think that it would be a very bad signal today if we were to vote in favour of the recommendation made by the Council.My group proposes that we postpone this vote until there is evidence, in Israel's policy and on the ground, of these famous signs called for unanimously by the delegation representing our Parliament a few months ago.\nPERSON021 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes we must take very difficult decisions. I think that the dispute which we in Europe - here in this House - are having about Israel and Palestine is always very difficult.When we take decisions, we must also actually keep the vision in mind. It would be disastrous if this House were to vote against a motion to strengthen the connections between Israel and the European Parliament. I repeat, it would be disastrous to vote against it. But it would also be disastrous to vote in favour when we all know how difficult and delicate the situation is. I was in Israel 14 days ago and saw for myself that both the Israelis and the Palestinians really are at the end of their tether. It would be disastrous to increase the frustration of the Israelis by saying no. And it would be just as disastrous to increase the frustration of the Palestinians by saying yes. Therefore, if we are intelligent, let us postpone the vote. For we still need to talk, we need to act. Sometimes it is more intelligent to continue the discussion calmly than to take a decision emotionally and too quickly which will frustrate and disappoint either one side or the other.In Europe we have a mediatory function and we must retain this function. For this reason, we propose postponing this vote. Being intelligent sometimes means waiting.\nPERSON022 : Mr President, I must mention in this regard that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, including the rapporteur, Mrs de Keyser, voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs de Keyser's report.As we said to the Israeli Foreign Minister yesterday when she met with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we understand the extreme concern felt by this House about the humiliation and frustration that the people of Palestine are suffering.It is precisely for those reasons, however, that we believe that Parliament has to take a stand, Mr President, in the first instance by means of a resolution. I can announce that my political group will accept the amendments tabled by the Left to establish a relationship. It is not a matter of upgrading relations with Israel, Mr Wurtz, but of voting for a resolution and for the assent that the European Parliament, according to the powers attributed to it by the Treaties, has to give to negotiations undertaken by the European Commission and the 27 Member States.That, Mr President, is why we believe that the European Parliament has to take a firm stand for peace - peace in the Middle East - and give its assent to the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with Israel. This item must therefore be kept on the agenda for the present plenary, as the Conference of Presidents of the political groups itself decided."

"transcript": "PERSON009 : One week ago today, on 26 November, a dramatic series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Mumbai in India. According to the Indian Interior Ministry, almost 190 people lost their lives, 22 of them foreigners, as a result of these terrible attacks. 200 people were injured in these attacks and it is still uncertain whether many of them will live.On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to voice my outrage at this monstrous attack on innocent people and to express our deepest sympathy with the families of all those who have died.I should also like to assure those injured in the attacks and their families of our support and our heartfelt sympathy.The European Parliament utterly condemns these terrorist acts and would like to manifest its solidarity with India, its people and its authorities in this time of mourning. Today we are all Indians at heart.Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is the attempt to destroy our values by means of indiscriminate violence - values which unite us in the European Union and in our Member States.Ladies and gentlemen, you know that a delegation of the Committee on International Trade from the European Parliament was in Mumbai at precisely the time of the attacks.In the midst of all the mourning over the tragic attacks, we would nevertheless like to express our joy and relief that all the participants of this parliamentary delegation trip are with us again safe and sound because some of the members of the delegation of the European Parliament were in the hotels affected at the time of the attacks and were in immediate mortal danger.Welcome back to Brussels all of you.Ladies and gentlemen, in particular I should like to greet the following in our midst: Ignasi Guardans, who led the delegation, Daniel Caspary, B\u00e9la Glattfelder, Syed Kamall, Sajjad Karim, Erika Mann, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Mia De Vits. It is wonderful that you are all here again.(Applause)I am also delighted that the following Members of the European Parliament are with us again and I greet them just as warmly: Alberto Rodas, Christopher Ford, Levente Csaszi and Vladymyr Dedobbeleer, and members of the political Groups Arielle Rouby and Barbara Melis as well as the interpreters Vincent Capet from the European Parliament and the two freelance interpreters Karen Twidle and Michael Hill.(Applause)We are all relieved that all in all you are well, and I hope that you can soon recover from this terrible experience mentally as well.My special thanks and my acknowledgement go to the people in India, to those who offered you protection and assistance despite the uncertain local situation.My thanks go also to the consulates of those Member States of the European Union who all according to the letter and spirit of the European Treaty showed solidarity in offering you assistance in an emergency.I should like to remind everyone that all citizens of the European Union whose country of origin has no local representation - as in this case in Mumbai - can contact the consulate of any other EU Member State. Such situations represent the genuine expression of a concrete solidarity between the people of the European Union.(Applause)Fellow Members, today, however, our thoughts go above all to the victims of the attacks in India and to their families. Their death and the circumstances which led to it are crimes which are unacceptable under any circumstances.Terrorism - wherever and by whoever it is committed - must be met with determined action and solidarity. The European Union is called upon to combat terrorism in any form together with the international community.In this we are guided by our principles of the rule of law. The fight against terrorism may only be conducted in accordance with those values which we defend.I have just heard the terrible news that less than an hour ago a 70-year-old businessman, Mr Ignacio Ur\u00eda Mendizabal, was murdered - it is said by ETA, it is not yet confirmed - in the Spanish town of Azpeitia, in the Basque Country.I wish to condemn this terrorist attack and to express my deep sadness and profound sympathy to the family and friends of Mr Ur\u00eda. I want also to express my solidarity with the Spanish people, their authorities and democratic institutions.I should like to ask you to rise from your seats in remembrance of the victims in Mumbai and the murdered citizens of the European Union in Spain and to commemorate the dead.(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)Ladies and gentlemen, many of you are wearing the little red bow at this time. Last Monday, 1 December 2008, marked the 20th World Aids Day.Aids-HIV is a terrible illness with which approximately 7 000 people are infected worldwide every 24 hours - without knowing it. Africa is the most severely affected, with 33 million already infected with HIV.But in Europe as well people are infected with the virus daily. According to official figures from the World Health Organisation WHO, between 1999 and 2006 more than 800 000 new infections were confirmed in Europe - just under 270 000 of them in the Member States of the European Union.At least every tenth newly infected person is under 25 years old. This underlines the urgent necessity for reinforced information and prevention campaigns and the provision of voluntary - as well as anonymous - tests.We must make a political undertaking to increase the resources for combating this illness and take measures for early detection and thus the earliest possible care and treatment.On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to expressly ask the Member States to take measures to prevent any discrimination and stigmatisation of those infected.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON172 : The next item is the Council statement on the situation in Guinea.\nPERSON173 : President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, we move from one item to the next. This is a very serious and important subject which the honourable Members have raised and chosen to put on the agenda.On Monday, 28 September, more than 100 people were killed in Conakry, Guinea, when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators. Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, to run for President. The final death toll is still unknown, as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues. At this stage, we do not know the real dimension of these tragic events. The number of injured people is said to be at least 1 200, and eye witnesses have reported that soldiers raped women on the streets of Conakry.During the violent repression, several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested. The number of protestors still under detention is also unknown; the houses of opposition leaders were ransacked and shops looted by uniformed men. In a TV statement the following day, Captain Camara expressed his condolences with the families of those killed and visited some of the injured. He proclaimed two days of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence. He distanced himself from the killings by saying that he was not in control of the elements of the military responsible for the atrocities.The European Union immediately and forcefully condemned these brutal and shocking events. A Presidency declaration, a statement by High Representative Solana and a statement by EU Commissioner De Gucht were issued the following day. We will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events.The violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation. The UN Security Council was briefed last Wednesday on the situation in the country. The African Union condemned the events and decided to prepare a report on possible measures to be taken. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a full international inquiry into the matter. Parliament, as you know, condemned the unconstitutional change of power, and in its resolution of 15 January 2009, called for respect for human rights and a rapid return to constitutional order. The EU decided to open consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and EU development aid - apart from humanitarian aid and support for democratic transition - was frozen.We have not been alone. Our international partners have acted in line with us. The African Union and ECOWAS decided to suspend Guinea until it established a democratically elected parliament or government. An international contact group on Guinea co-chaired by the African Union and ECOWAS, and with participation by the European Union, was put into place. In March, the military junta agreed with the opposition to have elections before the end of 2009, which gave reasonable hope for a peaceful and democratic transition. Captain Camara gave his assurances that none of the coup leaders would stand for political office. A national transitional council was to guide the transition process and prepare the necessary modification of the constitution in order to help elections.What can we do, then, to prevent further violence, and how can we help the people of Guinea in their legitimate desire for democracy, the rule of law, peace and development? Well, there are three main areas of action. First of all, we should maintain and reinforce political pressure on the regime in Conakry, notably in the context of the international group. Captain Camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return. The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso, Mr Blaise Compaor\u00e9, as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group, is a very positive sign, and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency. We hope that his mediation will contribute to a secure, peaceful and lasting solution to the situation in Guinea.Secondly, the option of targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for violence could be further explored. We will need to coordinate this approach with the African Union and other international and bilateral partners. The upcoming EU-African Ministerial Troika in Addis Ababa and the meeting on Guinea on 12 October in Abuja will be important in this respect.Thirdly, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and support the democratic transition process. The latter will nevertheless depend on the credible willingness of the transitional authorities of Guinea to re-engage in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with a clear commitment to refraining from further violence and to respecting the human rights and political freedoms of its citizens. We will spare no efforts to help the people of Guinea in this critical moment and we are determined to support a return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections. We encourage all stakeholders in Guinea to refrain from violence and to make a peaceful and democratic transition.\nPERSON174 : Mr President, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, the crisis in Guinea is, in my opinion, symptomatic of a wider problem which occurs, unfortunately, in many African countries. That problem is the weakness of democratic institutions and the underdevelopment and sometimes even the lack of mechanisms characteristic of mature civil societies. This is important for Europe not only because we are bound to our values - it is also important for purely pragmatic reasons.We discuss the effectiveness of development cooperation fairly often. This is not unusual, because we are the largest donor of this aid, and we must be interested in its effective use. However, we do have to face the fact that we will not achieve progress in effectiveness if the countries which make use of this development cooperation are not in a position to give minimum guarantees on the good use of this aid. Yet it so happens that it is hard to build such guarantees without democracy and civil society.Yesterday, Mr Camara accused France of humiliating Africans by breaking off relations with Guinea. This is not true. France has not humiliated Africans. It is Mr Camara himself who has humiliated his compatriots and Africans. He has humiliated them, because he has allowed killings, he has allowed rapes. The reaction of France and the French Government was justified and proper, and our position should be equally resolute and severe.It is a paradox, but the situation is fairly simple. We cannot fail to react to the brutal action which has been seen in Guinea. We must demand a halt to the use of violence. With Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, I think the mission of the President of Burkina Faso is a very good thing, and I wish him success. Let us hope that it will be effective. We should also support the African Union, which has announced the imposition of sanctions if civilian rule is not restored.We know about the commitment of Sweden to the process of building democracy. We know that just this is a real priority of the Presidency in the area of development policy. We know, too, that the Swedish Government has both experience and a record of success in this area. I want, therefore, to hope and believe that this commitment, in a case so difficult and extreme as Guinea, will be effective and will produce good fruit.\nPERSON175 : Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end.The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara's coup d'\u00e9tat on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections.Captain Camara's decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power.In response, the international community has unanimously condemned these violent actions and the Guinean regime. Outraged by these massacres, our Parliament's Committee on Fisheries recently refused, quite rightly, to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea.Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea?\nPERSON176 : Mr President, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I wish to extend every sympathy to the Conakry victims on behalf of both the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the 30 African parliamentarians in the ACP-EU Liberal Democrat Network whom we met last week to discuss, among other things, the situation in Guinea, together with the chairman of Guinea's liberal party, a party which, unfortunately, has been directly affected by the violence.As for what needs to be done, with regard to certain areas already mentioned by the Swedish Presidency, our requests are as follows: firstly, that together with our African Union partners, we demand the release of the prisoners and political leaders still being detained. Secondly, we must demand that free and democratic elections are held, without the participation of members of the National Council for Democracy and Development. Thirdly, I call for targeted sanctions to be adopted without too much pussyfooting around, since we must, in any case, send out a very clear message, in view of the atrocities which have been committed. Fourthly, we too wish to raise the issue of the fisheries agreement: we in the ALDE Group voted against it in the Committee on Fisheries, thereby helping secure the majority necessary to block the agreement, as far as possible. We believe that this is another important decision that the Council must take.The fifth point is that we must establish targeted programmes to assist the victims, especially the women who were raped and who certainly need special dedicated help. Lastly, there is the question of justice. For us, it is vital to have not only an international commission of inquiry, but also the full involvement of the International Criminal Court. We believe that if there is a lesson to be learnt from the Conakry victims, it is to confirm once again that justice must be done and that people who commit crimes of this nature in Africa or anywhere else cannot get off scot-free.\nPERSON177 : Presidents, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain silent in the face of the tragic events which took place last week in Guinea. The violence that was used against the opponents and, in particular, women, is utterly appalling and unacceptable.I wish to express my support for the victims as well as their families, some of whom are still waiting for the return of their loved ones' remains, which were taken away by the junta in order to cover up the traces of a true massacre.In addition to the current measures being initiated by the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the Guinean Government by rejecting the Report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Guinea, which we will vote on during the next plenary session.The Committee on Development already unanimously rejected, in September, this fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea, expressing doubts over the use of the funds allocated by the European Union. Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population, the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population.Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament cannot endorse the fisheries agreements with Guinea while the victims' wounds are still fresh. Doing so would send out the wrong message to the Guinean Government. It would be a scandal which I cannot bring myself to endorse.\nPERSON178 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many other new MEPs here, I was struck by the attention given to human rights in the debates held in this House, and particularly in those of our President Buzek. I subscribe to this completely because, if I am here, if I headed a list during the European elections in France, it is above all because I am a campaigner for associations and, specifically, a human rights campaigner.As such, I cannot be indifferent to the events in Guinea, as these were human rights campaigners, and more generally representatives of civil society, who were arrested, raped, in the case of women, and massacred on 28 September: more than 150 people were killed and more than 1 250 people were injured - as you said, Minister - in a single day. The repression continued in the days that followed and is still continuing, despite the fact that these people - as has also been said - came peacefully to remind Mr Camara of his own commitments. There is no doubt, according to the witness statements flooding in, that, contrary to the declarations made by the captain, these violent acts were carried out by forces close to the government.The situation there is confused, but having regrouped within the Guinean National Council of Civil Society Organisations, civil society organisations are appealing to the international community for help. In the last few months, this National Council has set an example in these countries of Africa by organising a major process for the Guinean people on the basis of the commitments made by Mr Camara.The news reaching us from Guinea is alarming. We cannot just make do with speeches here, in the European Parliament. This debate is taking place at our request, at the request of the Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, but we must go further. We call for the explicit condemnation of the repression of the demonstration.You have talked to us about targeted sanctions, Minister. Could you tell us more about this? On the matter of calling an immediate halt to persecution, of releasing all those arrested and of establishing an international commission of inquiry on these events, I believed, Minister, that we were moving in the right direction. However, could you give us some more information about this too?You also told us that all aid had been frozen, except for humanitarian and food aid. To us, that seems a minimum, but in practical terms, how can we support the transition to democracy?Mr President, we want a resolution to be voted on in the next Strasbourg part-session so that the European Parliament does not just limit itself to speeches, but acts by taking a decision, as it was able to do last January. I will say it once again: this is a matter of urgency. The organisations on the ground are warning us of the risk of ethnic conflict. We must not wait for a new Rwanda before we react; human rights must be defended in Africa just as they must be defended everywhere else in the world.\nPERSON179 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m described the situation in Guinea perfectly. For several weeks, Guinea has been the scene of violent clashes during which free citizens demonstrating in the streets in the name of their political beliefs have been subjected to unprecedented violence. The Guinean Government is persecuting and killing anyone whose political beliefs differ from those of their leaders, thereby depriving the people of any kind of freedom which, as we well know, is obviously an inviolable right for every human being.The umpteenth massacre is taking place and is in danger of turning into genocide if we do not urgently adopt immediate, tangible measures. Last week, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am Vice-Chairman, decided to adopt a resolution condemning the use of force by the Guinean authorities and demanding that the local government immediately complies with the rule of law and upholds fundamental rights.Following the deaths of 157 people in street clashes, and the attempts of Moussa Dadis Camara to cover this up, members of the opposition turned to the international community in the hope of receiving help and greater protection. On 5 October, however, Captain Camara opposed the presence of a foreign peacekeeping force in the country, rejecting any kind of foreign interference in internal affairs.I therefore feel that in addition to expressing our condemnation, we need to respond by taking immediate, concrete action, as my fellow Member Mr Rinaldi just said. In the face of violations and denials of the right to life - with women and children paying the price once again - we cannot fail to act and demand a return to the rule of law. Therefore, by calling upon you, my fellow Members and representatives of the institutions, I hope that we can reach unanimous agreement - and I stress unanimous - to adopt immediate measures enabling the people of Guinea to re-establish fundamental and inalienable rights, such as democracy and freedom, in their country. Naturally, I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events.\nPERSON180 : (SV) Mr President, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the Committee on Fisheries and I visited Guinea myself last December, so I have followed this matter very closely.First of all, I find it remarkable that the European Union is maintaining its fisheries agreement with Guinea, as the agreement was entered into with the previous regime two weeks before the coup. We have, in fact, stuck to an agreement that we entered into with a lawful regime, but now there is a military dictatorship. We have stuck to this all year.Yesterday, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, openly urged Moussa Dadis Camara and his regime to step down. I can only agree with this minimum demand and would also like to point out that it would be a disgrace for the European Parliament if, in two weeks' time, we were to vote in favour of a fisheries agreement with Guinea that would provide this regime with more than EUR 1 million at the end of November. The fisheries agreement relates to tuna fishing for 25 European boats. I believe that these boats will quite clearly have to look for other waters to fish in, because the EU cannot do business with dictatorships that slaughter their own people openly on the streets.The argument put to the Committee on Development and the Committee on Fisheries by the Commission that the money from the fisheries agreement will benefit the people is completely wrong. It reflects the Commission's evaluation of the previous agreement. We have no idea where the money from these fisheries agreements will end up. They related to the previous regime. I hardly think it likely that the present regime will use the money better.I wonder, therefore, what the Council is intending to do about the fisheries agreement. Does the EU intend to join with the US and demand that the regime steps down?\nPERSON181 : (RO) I also would like to say that I regard the acts of violence committed in Guinea as absolutely appalling. I see that two hours ago, the French Foreign Minister stated that Dadis Camara is assumed to have been involved in the decision to carry out the massacre, which is an extremely serious state of affairs.The source of the tensions, quite apart from the acts of violence which are appalling, undoubtedly lies in the fact that Dadis Camara wishes to become Guinea's leader permanently and is reluctant to keep his promise not to have any involvement whatsoever in the country's political life. I believe, too, that the international pressure exerted in connection with this must be very clear. On the other hand, I welcome that the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who has a great deal of experience in conducting negotiations and mediation in African conflicts, has been appointed as a mediator in this case. I believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic efforts.\nPERSON182 : Mr President, I must correct Mrs Joly when she said that the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously to reject this proposed partnership agreement with Guinea. In fact, it voted by just one vote to do so. Quite astonishingly, the PPE Group voted solidly to retain the agreement. This is an agreement which puts some hundreds of thousands of euros into the hands of this regime in order that we can take tuna from the coast. Like many of these agreements, it is a shabby deal at the best of times and, in the present circumstances, it is utterly unacceptable.The Minister mentioned possible sanctions to be taken against Guinea. Will she now add this to her list and give us an undertaking that she will fight to try and ensure that this partnership agreement is suspended?\nPERSON183 : Mr President, as a human rights lawyer with almost a quarter of a century of experience internationally and at home in Hungary, I take every opportunity to emphasise the need for the European Union to defend human rights, preferably across the world. But it is extremely important to do it in a credible way and, in order to do so, we have to defend human rights within our borders as well, within the European Union system.As I have mentioned to you several times during the last three months, Mrs Kinga G\u00f6ncz, a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in this Parliament, used to be a member of a government which we call in Hungary the 'eye-shooter' government, who were shooting at people on the streets of Budapest on 23 October 2006. Ever since then, there has been a human rights crisis in Hungary, and this European Union does not do anything about it. We have a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties who was a member of the government at that time. Until we look seriously into this matter, nobody will think that anything we do in the human rights fields is credible.\nPERSON184 : President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, again my thanks to the European Parliament for putting this on the agenda. It is a very serious subject and, as I hope you understood from my introduction, we share your concerns about the horrible breach of human rights that has happened in Conakry. There are concerns and worries about people still being detained, and we have asked for a complete investigation of what has happened and the release of the prisoners.I think we can say that the European Union has been extremely clear. The events have been condemned by Mr Solana, Mr De Gucht, the Presidency and now, as I know, also by a declaration of the ACP Group in the European Parliament. It is very good that the European Union is unanimous, concrete and concise in its condemnation of these horrible events. We are also acting in very close cooperation with other actors in this, so that the international community can condemn and act in a very coherent way. That is the only way we can really exercise pressure.We have the international contact group. There has been the appointment of the mediator, the President of Burkina Faso, which is very good, and he is a member of the contact group. Together with the contact group, of which the EU and the US are members, we have - in answer to your question, Mrs L\u00f6vin - called for Captain Camara's resignation. The whole world community has asked for that to happen.We are also open to answering other questions and to discuss sanctions. We think it will have more effect if we do it together with the international community. There are different options on how you can target individuals and so on in this, and we need, in the coming days, to further discuss with international actors how we can coordinate those sanctions in order for them to have the maximum effect: with the African Union, with the contact group, with the US, etc.We have also, as I said, opened consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and we have frozen all EU development aid, apart from the humanitarian aid and the assistance to the democratic transition.On fisheries - whether that can be part of it or not - I hear very clearly what you say. I can only encourage you to continue the discussions with the Commission. It is the Commission which is responsible for EU fishery policy. We are also discussing this with the Commission, and I am sorry they are not here right now. But you can be assured that we will keep on working with the international community to continue with the pressure and to push for a full investigation and, hopefully, also one day for free and fair elections in Guinea. My thanks to you and to the Members for this debate.\nPERSON185 : Thank you very much, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m. You have had so much patience spending the whole afternoon and part of the evening here. One can see that not so long ago, you were a Member of this House and so you like this environment very much!The debate is closed."

"transcript": "PERSON187 : The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.\nPERSON188 : (RO) We welcome the signing of the Nabucco project agreement on 13 July in Ankara. However, gas is not the only energy resource available to European states. We must adopt the same approach with regard to supplying Europe with crude oil by promoting a southern corridor.A project has been tabled before us which may assume the same strategic importance as Nabucco. I am talking about the pan-European Constan\u0163a - Trieste oil pipeline. This pipeline will transport the oil resources in the Caspian Sea via the Georgian terminal at Supsa, continuing along a pipeline via the port of Constan\u0163a right to Trieste.We can only guarantee energy security for our states and citizens through the diversification of the supply sources and routes for oil and gas. With this in mind, Romania has embarked on developing a port terminal in Constan\u0163a, capable of receiving liquefied natural gas which it will then distribute to other consumers in Europe.\nPERSON189 : (FR) Mr President I will use the one minute of speaking time that we have been allotted to draw attention to the positive consequences - as everyone in this House knows - of the Irish people's positive vote on the constitutional treaty. This vote will mean that, particularly in a committee like that on agriculture, as well as in this Parliament, in plenary, we will have codecision. Parliament will therefore be on an equal footing with the Council which, in democratic terms, obviously represents huge progress.I would like to use this opportunity to point out that, since an overwhelming majority of our Irish friends said 'yes' today to the constitutional treaty and the Polish President - according to what the President of our Parliament said just now - is also about to sign the treaty, all that is needed is a 'yes' from the Czech President. I would therefore like all our fellow Members from different political groups to be able, within the context of our respective competences, to try to convey to their Czech counterparts the message that this treaty really must be signed, all the more so since the Czech Parliament has already said 'yes'. All that is left for the President to do is to sign this parchment and thus take the democratic way forward in his country, so as to advance our democracy in Europe.\nPERSON190 : (IT) Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina - which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today - and its dozens of casualties. So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires.However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia.This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina.\nPERSON191 : (PL) Mr President, I would like to speak in defence of the Polish minority in Lithuania, which recently has been subjected to discrimination. There is a painful paradox here, in that Poles in Lithuania, who in some regions constitute the majority of citizens, were in a better situation before the accession of Lithuania to the European Union than now, when Lithuania is a member of the EU.The self-government of the Salcininkai region has been given until 14 October to remove Polish street name signs, which is against European standards and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. In March 2008, freedom of activity of the Polish school system was restricted, on the strength of Lithuanian law. In the space of one and a half years, four schools, with a total of 45 classes, were closed, and a further 107 classes are threatened with closure. Changes are being forced on Polish surnames, so that they look like Lithuanian ones. Finally, many Poles have still not been returned property which was seized by the communists, by the Soviet Union, after 1939 or after 1944.I appeal to the European Parliament to defend Poles in Lithuania, in accordance with European standards of human rights and the rights of minorities.\nPERSON192 : (PT) Mr President, optimistic proclamations are being made concerning the announcement of the beginning of the end of the crisis. Unfortunately, these declarations are contradicted by reality on a daily basis. The situation in northern Portugal is an illustration of this. In the District of Braga alone, at least 10 companies have closed in recent weeks, leaving more than 300 workers unemployed. Many others are at risk of closing.The situation is particularly serious in the textile and clothing sector: one of the sectors of the European Union to be worst affected by the increasing liberalisation of world trade. In this tragic situation, there is an urgent need for solutions that are different from the political guidelines that caused it.It is vital to implement safeguard measures, in particular, in sectors to be indicated by the Member States, in order to be able to sustain and promote jobs and the continued operation of these companies, as well as to move forward with the creation - an issue that has already been the subject of a resolution by this Parliament - of a Community programme to support the textile sector, with adequate resources specifically targeted at the least favoured regions that are dependent on this sector.\nPERSON193 : Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster. The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink.The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty. It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee.To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe. Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward's unfortunate prophecy to be correct.\nPERSON194 : Mr President, there was a lot of talk today about the Lisbon Treaty and how it strengthens solidarity among Europeans. On behalf of the Hungarian people, I would like to call for your solidarity now because, according to reliable information from human-rights-sensitive, high-ranking members of the Hungarian police, on the third anniversary of so-called Bloody Monday in 2006 (23 October), the Hungarian police will again use massive violence against the Hungarian people during our demonstrations or commemorations.I would like to call on Members of the European Parliament to come to our aid and to come to Budapest on that day as human rights observers. I would like your constituencies to ask you to do that, too. Please do your research on the Internet about the human rights abuses and mass police brutalities in Hungary and make sure that it can never happen again. Please come and exercise the solidarity that has so often been mentioned today.\nPERSON195 : (HU) I would like to mention the Slovak language law, which has raised grave concerns ever since its approval. The past few weeks have shown that these concerns were justified because, although the penalties prescribed in this law have not yet been applied, government employees have been ordered to speak only Slovak. This means that during working hours, postal workers, fire fighters and police officers whose mother tongue is Hungarian are not allowed to use their own language.Therefore, if I speak Hungarian to a policeman in Slovakia, he is obliged to answer me in Slovak, even if Hungarian is his mother tongue, and regardless of the fact that I do not understand his reply. Incidentally, the situation is the same if I try to speak in English. I would like to suggest a new advertising message for the Slovak hospitality sector: we love having foreign tourists in Slovakia, provided that they learn Slovak before they set foot in our country. Welcome to Absurdistan!\nPERSON196 : (SK) I anticipated or expected more of these attacks on the Slovak Republic, since the institution of one-minute speeches provides an ideal opportunity for colleagues from Hungary or colleagues of Hungarian nationality to attack the Slovak Republic.I have to say that this worries me greatly, because I expect the European Parliament actually to solve the problems confronting the European Union. We have extended the hand of friendship several times to fellow MEPs from Fidesz and other parties in plenary sessions here in the European Parliament, wanting to discuss unresolved problems or issues with them. This is what we did in the case of the language law and I must say that I am very disappointed, Mr President, that none of our fellow MEPs from Hungary or of Hungarian ethnicity responded to the offer and my colleagues from the SMK (which is a party from the Slovak Republic) even preferred to walk out of such a session when we raised the topic.I have also accessed the website of the Parliament of the Slovak Republic, where it is possible to read through this law in full, and the law does not in any way threaten the right of ethnic minorities to use their own languages.\nPERSON197 : Mr President, the Spanish Government has decided that the Barcelona to Perpignan high-speed train line should run just under the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Cathedral, putting at risk a monument that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984 and was visited by three million tourists last year. The construction of a new tunnel extremely close to the foundation of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Cathedral may lead to irreparable damage to that building.The Spanish Government says that there is no problem, but this year the tunnelling machines of a new metro line in Barcelona have experienced multiple incidents in similar land conditions. One tunnelling machine has been blocked near the Llobregat River for some months without anyone knowing how to solve the situation. I wish to report the risk of the collapse of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia to the European institutions. To preserve this European masterpiece of general interest, please examine the matter, stop the work being carried out by the Spanish Government and change the route of the tunnel.\nPERSON198 : (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the problem of hold-ups regarding the invitation to the Autonomous Train Drivers' Unions of Europe (ALE) to join the railways section of the Committee for Social Dialogue. Since 2005, this body has brought together more than 100 000 members from 16 European member organisations of train drivers and has sought to be recognised as a fully-fledged social partner in the section of social dialogue dealing with railways. Despite lengthy negotiations with the European Transport Workers' Federation, which is currently the sole representative of employee interests on this committee, it has not yet been possible to find a compromise that would give ALE the possibility of directly defending its members' interests. In my opinion, this is a very unfortunate state of affairs. Social dialogue, as approved by the European Parliament, should, in my view, allow pluralism. I firmly believe that no organisation, not even one that represents 80% of employees in the European rail sector, has the right to a monopoly and I therefore call on all parties, including the European Commission, to clear the way for further negotiations.\nPERSON199 : Mr President, the directives of the European Union and the laws in the Member States on the eight-hour day and reactionary restructurings in general are creating mediaeval working conditions, provoking anger among and demonstrations by the workers. The European Commission is flooded daily with protests by angry farmers and indignant workers.For example, the working times for airline cabin crews and pilots, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1899/2006, exceed 14 hours' work a day, thereby endangering the lives of workers and passengers, as proven by numerous scientific studies.The European Union refuses to take account of the scientific studies, because it is obeying the orders of the monopoly business groups which refuse to sacrifice even a single euro of their profits for the health of workers and in-flight safety.We are calling for airline pilots' and cabin crews' working times to be reduced and for workers' just demands to be satisfied. Moreover, the European Commission has a commitment both towards the European Parliament and towards the workers.\nPERSON200 : (DE) Mr President, the whole ratification process for the Constitution Reform Treaty of Lisbon was a tragedy for democracy and also for the European Union. Perhaps you would allow me, as a new, young MEP, to say that, through referendums for all citizens in the European Union, we had the opportunity, historically, to unite the very elitist drawing board project of the European Union with the people of Europe. You had the opportunity to use referendums to breathe life and spirit into the emotional wreck of the European Union. However, you did not utilise this opportunity. On the contrary, you quite simply said 'no' to more direct democracy and 'no' to citizen participation.All I can say to that is that this is not what I call democracy. Democracy requires the separation of powers and a clear line between opposition and government. That is what we stand for and that is what we are fighting for.\nPERSON201 : (HU) Let me begin, Mr President, by saying that what Mrs Be\u0148ov\u00e1 said is not true. Five young Hungarians have already spent five years in prison in Serbia following a drunken brawl in the southern town of Temerin. They were handed down sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years. They were sentenced to a total of 61 years and their case was used by nationalists as election propaganda. Not even those who committed war crimes during the Balkan War have been given such stiff sentences. During the same period, around 300 Hungarians were beaten in Serbia without any legal repercussions. This gives a ratio of 300 to 1.The European Parliament sent a fact-finding delegation to Serbia in January 2005. However, we have been waiting since then for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to discuss the report on the investigation into the brutal beating of Hungarians. I call on Parliament and President Jerzy Buzek to have the young men from Temerin released from prison. The EU must stipulate as a prerequisite for Serbia's accession that it should run its judicial system without discrimination and that, instead of delivering intimidating, prejudiced verdicts, it should catch the real villains, Serbian war criminals.\nPERSON202 : Mr President, my country, Lithuania, is very similar to Ireland in many ways and the yes of its people for the Lisbon Treaty has clearly demonstrated the will of all our citizens for a stronger and more effective Europe. It has clearly shown that we are unable to act on our own in times of crisis and to ensure prosperity for our people.More than ever, the Community must speak with one voice, and solidarity among the Member States is the basis for that. Europe is undergoing difficult times, and the reforms proposed by the Lisbon Treaty will give an impetus for a more effective institutional structure which will undoubtedly lead to more coherent policies in many areas. It is indeed a great achievement, both for Europe and for every one of us.Once again I congratulate the Irish people for their determination to have a better and more prosperous Union.\nPERSON203 : (FR) Mr President, on Monday - and this will not have escaped anyone's attention - milk producers from the four corners of Europe once again demonstrated in Brussels to state, to proclaim their despair and their distress faced with the collapse of milk prices, which is preventing them from carrying out their work. Even more than that, it is their future that is at stake here.The call for a new form of regulation is today supported by a large majority of the Member States, the dairy G20, as we will call it from now on. I think that, now more than ever, the time has come to take decisions, and certainly at the next Council - a formal one this time - of the Ministers for Agriculture, which will take place on 19 October in Luxembourg. This is extremely urgent. A crisis of this magnitude must not become the subject of a commission study, as happened two days ago.Very briefly, I have two questions for President Buzek, which I trust you will pass on to him. I understand that this morning he met Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Swedish Minister for European Affairs, and I would like to know if she was able to confirm to him the Presidency's commitment to find an urgent solution to this crisis, along the lines of the resolution that we voted for in Strasbourg at the last part-session.Finally, I come to this high-level group, this think tank that was launched the day before yesterday. Before and as from the next entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we know our Parliament will become a joint decision maker, a colegislator. I think that it would make sense for us to be included in the work of this high-level group.\nPERSON204 : (LT) In August, Marijus Ivanilovas, a 35-year-old Lithuanian national and director of the printing house of the daily newspaper 'Respublika', i.e. a person with a permanent job and income, was detained in Belarus, not far from Minsk, and has already been held for two months without trial or proof of his guilt in a prison in the Belarusian city of Zhodin. A few days ago, the term for detaining Mr Ivanilovas was extended, as in two months, the regime's authorities were unable to find any proof of his guilt. It is also important to point out that from childhood, Mr Ivanilovas has suffered from bronchial asthma. To his parents' knowledge, he is held in a cell where there are 26 prisoners, but only 6 beds and people smoke in the cell constantly. Marijus has asthma attacks, but he is not allowed to receive his medicine, nor is he allowed to meet loved ones or even the Lithuanian consul. Mr President, this is happening in a country in our neighbourhood. This is how the citizen of an EU Member State - Lithuania - is being treated! I call on you to take measures within your powers to ensure the immediate release of Marijus Ivanilovas, as there is no proof of his guilt and the charge is unfounded. Mr Ivanilovas must be allowed to return to Lithuania. He needs immediate medical attention.\nPERSON205 : (RO) Last December, the European Union made an historic commitment to reduce carbon emissions, thereby confirming its leading position in terms of efforts to combat climate change.We can be proud of the role that the European Parliament has played in adopting legislation which contains not only provisions for reducing the pollution level, but also specific measures to enable us to fulfil these commitments, which will help determine the rise in global temperature.During the negotiations in Copenhagen this December, we must obtain firm commitments in terms of reducing emissions and the level of financial support granted to developing countries to enable them to alleviate the impact of, and adapt to, climate change. However, climate change legislation cannot be adopted in the United States prior to the Copenhagen conference, although the Obama administration will endeavour to conduct the negotiations, but without a clear mandate.The European Union's common position must not be wasted. It is vital for us to speak with a single voice and encourage the other countries to follow our example in the task of reducing emissions.\nPERSON206 : (SK) The Hungarian representatives are misleading European public opinion with many untruths. They claim, for example, that citizens can be fined for using a minority language, that doctors of Hungarian nationality will be able to work only in the official Slovak language, or that religious services can be conducted only in the official language.We have now heard Hungarian MEPs talking nonsense about policemen not being allowed to respond to tourists in Hungarian or English. None of this is true. On the contrary, the amended law increases the possibilities for using ethnic minority languages compared to the situation previously. The amendment does not interfere with private communications between citizens and does not enable fines to be imposed on individuals. The conformity of the amended law to international standards has been confirmed by the European authorities in the area of minorities - OSCE High Commissioner Knut Volleb\u00e6k and EU Commissioner Leonard Orban. In my opinion, the Hungarian community is exploiting this cause in an attempt to conceal growing extremism and the murder of Roma people in Hungary.\nPERSON207 : (PL) Mr President, I regret to inform you that the rights of people who leave the Catholic Church in Poland are being broken. Against the will of the apostates, their personal details are not removed from parish archives. On the contrary, they continue to be used. This is the instruction concerning the protection of personal data in the activity of the Catholic Church in Poland. The part of the instruction we are talking about is not based on the prevailing Personal Data Protection Act, but - and listen carefully - on the provisions of the Code of Canon Law.How is it that in Poland, which claims to uphold the rule of law, canon law has precedence over law made by the national Parliament? Why does the Code of Canon Law govern the rights of citizens who are not Catholics? How is it possible that the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection does not have any authority to inspect church archives? There is only one explanation: Poland is a church state. The European Parliament should react to this.\nPERSON208 : (RO) The subject of my speech today is linked to the most important event that has taken place recently in the European Union, namely the successful outcome of the referendum organised by Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon.I also wish to share the sentiments of my fellow Members who have had the opportunity today to congratulate the Irish people on giving this very clear signal of their decision to opt to continue the process of European integration at a political level. They have not succumbed to the populist declarations which drew attention to some of the adverse consequences because this Treaty will quite obviously make European institutions operate more efficiently and democratically.I also think that it is the duty of the Czech President to respect the undertakings made when this Treaty was negotiated and not to impede without justification its implementation. We need this Treaty to close the institutional chapter in the EU's development, at least for a while, so that we can become more involved with the EU's policies. The last two states, Poland and the Czech Republic, must ratify the Treaty as soon as possible so that the appointments can be made to the new posts provided for by the Treaty, both in the Commission and at Council level.\nPERSON209 : (HU) A great deal was said about the Slovak language law during the last parliamentary sitting, as is the case today. This is no coincidence. This law limits the extent to which minorities can use their own language, contrary to the various statements made, although it is true that minority languages can also be used in a very small area of public life. However, it is not true that we are avoiding debate on this matter because, if someone tries to agree in five minutes on this subject in front of 10 journalists, they will probably fail. I would like to draw attention to the fact that as this law has been poorly drafted in bad faith, it is creating fresh legal uncertainty because in two days, the Slovak Ministry of Culture has provided three different explanations for some of the articles in the law.It has instilled fear in people. We are already aware of several instances where employers are ordering their employees to speak Slovak. I deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber. I hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will provide us with the chance to deal properly with human rights and minority rights.\nPERSON210 : (ES) Mr President, piracy is a problem of concern to this Parliament, the Member States and, naturally, Spain, because we currently have a Spanish fishing boat that has been seized in the waters of the Indian Ocean, with 36 crew members on board.The first thing that I would like to do is to express my sympathy for the crew and their families, and naturally, give my support to the Spanish Government in securing its speedy release.We are not, however, talking about a problem affecting Spain's tuna fleet specifically, but one that affects three countries - France, Italy and Spain - that are fishing in international waters, outside Somalia's exclusive area. In view of that, an international reply and joint European preventive and response measures will be required. That means more resources devoted to an improved Operation Atlanta, which already exists and which has been successful in terms of a reduction in the number of vessels seized in 2009 as compared with 2008.Finally, I would like to touch upon the support that we should offer for an international summit on piracy in Somalia, because we must improve international relations in order to iron out these problems on the ground, and because we need to improve international dialogue.\nPERSON211 : Mr President, many in the House have today congratulated the Irish people on their good sense in rejecting the appeals of Nigel Farage and the UK Independence Party and voting overwhelmingly in favour of the Lisbon Treaty.Members should perhaps also commiserate with the British people, because we have to put up with Mr Farage on a daily basis. He calls a two-to-one majority in Ireland a 'victory for bully boys'. I am afraid his words are all too typical of a man who uses distortions and deceit, and sometimes downright lies, about the European Union. All too often, those words are unchallenged by journalists.However, hyperbole can turn to insanity. Now he is comparing the campaign in Ireland with the brutality of the latest elections in Zimbabwe. He describes the Treaty that gives every Member State the right to withdraw from the Union as an end of independence. Nevertheless, we should be compassionate. Parliament has a medical service. Mr President, I invite you to ask the men in white coats to offer their services to our colleague. Nonsense about Europe may pour from his lips but at least they can help ensure that he does not choke on it.\nPERSON212 : (PL) I would like here, in the European Parliament, to refer to the statement made by Polish and German bishops on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. At this particular time, when the thoughts of many people turn to those traumatic events, it has been pointed out to us that we should take special care of the young generation, so that they will be able to learn the truth about history appropriately and thoroughly and, on that truth, to build a common future.It is impossible not to recall here the first letter from the Polish bishops to the German bishops in 1965 which encouraged reconciliation and the establishment of partnership relations between our countries.Today, as then, we care about building trust and friendly relations between our nations. However, although we are on this common road of reconciliation, we are, today, in a different place. Let us create a common Europe together, a Europe of cooperation and friendship, a Europe of values which are based on Christian roots, and which were the basis for the creation of Europe by the founding fathers of the European Community. In the interest, therefore, of the good of our common future, we should take careful note of the warnings and recommendations which are found in the joint statement of the Polish and German bishops.\nPERSON213 : (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said today about minority issues. I would like to give you a positive example in this area. Serbia has adopted a law on cultural autonomy which is unique throughout the whole of Europe, and which is positive not only for the whole of the European Union, but for the whole of Europe too.According to this law, 13 minorities, including Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians and other peoples, can directly elect their own national councils. These national councils are financed out of the budget and can, under this cultural autonomy, handle and control the relevant institutions. The other lesson to be learnt is that the minorities were involved in drafting this law. Therefore, Serbia can set an example for many EU countries, such as France, Slovakia and others, in terms of how to guarantee the rights of minorities in law. This has also helped Serbia take a major step on the road to European integration.\nPERSON214 : Mr President, being a Hungarian MEP coming from Romania, I will not speak today about the Slovak language, even though I am afraid I would have good reason to do so. Instead, I want to speak about our decision today to set up a special committee on the economic crisis.This decision proves the responsibility of our Parliament in the biggest challenge currently confronting Europe. The special committee will reaffirm the European Union position concerning the new global financial governance, but will also interact with the Member States, aiming at best implementation of Community measures meant to generate sustainable economic growth.It is vital for the new Member States in the central and eastern part of Europe to receive necessary support for economic recovery. Coordination of recovery efforts should be more efficient, and enhanced coordination is not only the responsibility of the governments but also the responsibility of Brussels.We are facing a most complicated economic perspective accompanied by the imminence of serious social unrest. That is why the European Union has to put forward the most efficient response to the deteriorating situation in the region and this House must show leadership on this issue.\nPERSON215 : (ES) Mr President, a few days ago, 36 people were kidnapped while they were fishing in waters of the Indian Ocean under the aegis of an agreement approved by the European Commission.On 15 September, I condemned the risky situation and the helplessness and defencelessness of these workers. I put forward certain concrete measures, but nothing was done.Unfortunately, we are therefore now in the position of speaking about those who have been kidnapped and are being held by the pirates.I therefore ask the European Commission to be forceful and to recommend to the Member States that soldiers be posted on fishing vessels, and I ask it to address this recommendation to the Spanish Government, because it has been an effective measure. France is taking this action and we can see the results.This Parliament has acknowledged, in a resolution, that the fisheries sector is defenceless because priority has been given to the merchant navy. The European Commission official also acknowledged this on the eve of the seizure and we therefore ask that this protection be extended to fishing vessels.I also call upon the President to express and pass on our sympathy and support to those who have been kidnapped, and their families, and for him to invite the skipper of the vessel, once he has been freed, to Parliament.\nPERSON216 : (HU) There has been much talk earlier about minorities. I would also like to draw attention to the 50 million people with disabilities who live within the European Union. I regard them as the biggest minority. The financial crisis is hitting them hardest. I want to emphasise that these people are always the first to lose their jobs, see a fall in their incomes, have few opportunities for a livelihood and experience a drop in their standard of living, not to mention the ever-dwindling support given to the social organisations representing them.The biggest lesson from the current crisis is that it is worthwhile investing in people, including on an individual basis, even instead of other types of investment. Political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities. I ask you therefore to do everything you can for them so that they receive fairer treatment from you. I am stressing this point because 50 million people can have a huge amount of clout within the European Union, and it is in our interest to ensure equal opportunities in society.\nPERSON217 : Mr President, of course I am delighted that the Lisbon Treaty has passed in my country. However, it has been seen this afternoon that the debate on the Reform Treaty has been poised between a reality and a distraction, and we must not stand still in its wake. The reality is that the world has changed fundamentally over recent decades, as a much greater proportion of it is now competing with us in a global market.Quite simply, Europe must behave more coherently if it is to prosper. The Treaty now obliges the European institutions to be more democratic and more responsive to individual European people. The Charter of Fundamental Rights insists on this. We do not have the luxury of acting only in the interests of our own nations; we need to strengthen the Union which every one of us represents. As we did in our referendum, we need to continue to communicate who and what we are.\nPERSON218 : (RO) During the current economic crisis the European funds are key instruments for the less developed regions in Member States in terms of helping them achieve convergence objectives.A long and not exactly simple process is involved between the time these objectives are specified and the funds actually being taken up by the beneficiaries, which is also hampered by a series of bureaucratic EU regulations. At a time when we MEPs are highlighting the effects of the economic crisis and are adopting measures to speed up the process and simplify the regulations for accessing these funds, Member States are only benefiting slowly from these measures and not to the full extent.On this point, I wish to mention a specific example from Romania. Projects financed by the European Social Fund, aimed at improving workers' conditions and increasing the number of employees in certain companies, are still encountering problems during their implementation.I would like to call for the measures aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing the funds to be speeded up in order to facilitate job creation in Europe's regions.\nPERSON219 : Mr President, it is with extreme urgency that I call on Parliament to see that the EUR 14.8 million promised to the workers in the mid-west of Ireland in areas like Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary who worked for Dell Computers and its suppliers is allocated as soon as possible. This money was promised by the Commission President under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in a recent visit to Limerick. There is no going back on it and, whatever the issues relating to protocol and how this Fund is administered may be, these need to be overcome immediately. Parliament should not delay this money, which would give the region a much-needed economic stimulus. It was estimated at one stage that Dell and its suppliers employed one in every five people throughout the mid-west of Ireland, so this area has been hard hit.That is why I urge the Commission to review the rules on State aid support. These were drawn up in 2006 before the massive shock that the loss of Dell and the other industries created. I urge the Commission to include the mid-west of Ireland as an area of serious unemployment in the review of State aid rules next year, so that it can qualify for the now much-needed EU funding.\nPERSON220 : (HU) Mr President, the role of the European Parliament - and I quote its President - is to mediate between disputing parties and countries, if necessary. Parliament should not only get involved in fire fighting, but should contribute to preventing the fire as well.Parliament should adopt, for instance, a minority framework law that guarantees minorities' rights. Minorities are entitled to feel safe. Such a framework law will help ensure that minorities are not at the mercy of governments, extremist organisations and such actions as the Slovak language law which punishes minorities for using their mother tongue. It is unacceptable that within the European Union, minority organisations are banned, bilingual place name signs are painted over and extremist organisations stage provocative anti-minority demonstrations.Part of the European Parliament's role is to implement legislation which protects human rights, prevents discrimination and guarantees that minorities can live as fully valued human beings in the land of their birth.\nPERSON221 : (ES) Mr President, in the face of the hijacking of the Spanish fishing vessel Alakrana by pirates in the Indian Ocean, I want to point to the firm resolve of the Spanish Government, with the support of the European Union, to free the 36 crew members - 16 of them Spaniards - to bring them back safe and sound, and to bring the hijackers to justice.Thanks to Atalanta, the European operation, which was begun in December 2008 at the initiative of France and Spain, joined by other European Union countries, we now have a significant deployment of forces in the area. The expansion of the protection area does not, however, extend as far as the location where the fishermen are fishing, and that is why we are issuing a call to the ship operators, asking them not to go outside the security area, and we are urging the European Union and its Member States to grant an extension to the south of the coverage of Atalanta and more resources to guarantee the free movement of the 20 000 vessels crossing an ocean whose surface is three times greater than that of the Mediterranean.Although the deployment has guaranteed access for the merchant ships that carried 227 000 tonnes for the United Nations Food Programme to Somalia, now we must make an effort to cover the work of the dozens of European fishing vessels fishing in the area.Lastly, we urge the Member States to mobilise their information and intelligence services in order to look for and arrest the intermediaries that give tip-offs to the pirates and get paid for rescues, operating from European soil.\nPERSON222 : Mr President, there has been much talk in the last two hours and the last couple of weeks in Ireland about a communications deficit and the need to bring Europe closer to the people.I have a suggestion to make: I think that we should discuss this at some future time in this Parliament, particularly to get the views of MEPs on how the Commission and the MEPs themselves can be involved in this whole area, because national governments have proven reluctant in the past to give credit to the European Union for what it does and, as a result, the people are not aware of it.We now, with our increased powers and increased opportunities, should take that opportunity to discuss this issue here in Parliament and come up with ways and proposals on how we can actually help to clear that deficit and bring Europe closer to its people. It would be an exercise well worth doing.\nPERSON223 : (RO) In June 2009, the European Council called on the European Commission to draw up and present a strategy for the Danube region by the end of 2010.The European Commission and Member States should adopt a common European strategy which will combine current Danube initiatives and boost the importance of this river as part of the European Union's policies. The Danube region strategy should focus on common objectives and projects in the areas of transport, energy, the environment and cultural cooperation.Last year, the European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism organised a delegation to the Danube region to find out about and promote the potential offered by this river as part of EU policies. One of the main conclusions reached by this delegation was to create in the European Parliament an intergroup to promote the River Danube. The creation of this intergroup helps the European Parliament reaffirm its commitment to be involved in and actively support both the drafting of a strategy for the Danube region and its implementation.\nPERSON224 : (ES) Mr President, I would like to call the attention of this House to the fact that 27 September was the thirtieth World Tourism Day, held under the slogan 'Tourism - Celebrating Diversity', at a time when we are all hoping for the rapid entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which incorporates tourism as a new sphere of action for the European Union.One of the sector's challenges is to improve the range of tourism experiences on offer for the whole world without discrimination.As pointed out by the Montreal Declaration, access to tourist leisure for the whole world necessarily means being involved in the struggle against inequality and the exclusion of the culturally different, those of limited means or abilities, or those who live in developing countries.Parliament has translated this ambition into a pilot project on social tourism which the Commission will develop this year. Another reason for its actions is that social tourism helps the employment rate by combating seasonality - one of the sector's major problems - and creates greater equality, more jobs and jobs which last for longer.Ladies and gentlemen, that is our objective.\nPERSON225 : (ES) Mr President, just a few hours ago, Cristo Ancor Cabello was killed in Herat in Afghanistan. He was a Spanish soldier belonging to the International Security Assistance Force, the force deployed under a mandate from the United Nations in which soldiers of many different nationalities carry out a very difficult task, deserving of our gratitude, to improve the living conditions and the security of the Afghan civilian population.Mr President, I ask you to pass on the condolences of the European Parliament to his family, as well as our support and sympathy to his fellow soldiers, among whom there are five wounded.Mr President, I would also like to add that the Spanish Government is maintaining its firm undertaking to ensure the security of all troops on peace missions deployed abroad, not just in Afghanistan, but also in other locations around the world.\nPERSON226 : (RO) The last two rounds of enlargement of the European Union have brought numerous benefits to old and new Member States alike, while also posing a number of challenges.Two years after its accession to the European Union, Romania is one of the countries with the lowest success rates in terms of accessing European funds. The procedure for accessing European money is fairly complicated and impenetrable. The Structural and Cohesion Funds provide financial leverage which may facilitate economic recovery, particularly during the current crisis.Against this background, I feel that we need simple rules for accessing the Structural Funds so that European money can reach beneficiaries as quickly as possible. Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support.We must encourage efforts at European level aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing the funds earmarked for Romania in order to accelerate their allocation and rapid absorption.\nPERSON227 : That concludes the item.(The sitting was suspended at 20.40 and resumed at 21.00)"

"transcript": "PERSON248 : The next item is the debate on the oral question by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to the Commission on passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy-B7-0210/2009).\nPERSON249 : author. - Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani for being with us this evening. This question was submitted by me on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, as Members had become very concerned over the summer months by the collapse of SkyEurope airline, and approached me to take this initiative on their behalf.It is worth noting that we have had 77 airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000 and, in the sad but likely event that some more may follow in this tough economic climate, we believe it is imperative that we use this question tonight to at least open up the debate now about how we can best protect consumers and air travellers in the European Union.In the case of SkyEurope, it was an airline based in Slovakia. We saw passengers being left stranded at destinations, without accommodation or even a flight home. We also had the problem that many of those people were told that compensation, or even refunds, would not be possible as they had not purchased their ticket with a credit card or booked through a travel agent. These were passengers who had booked online through their own accounts, a practice that has been increasing over many years.It is not an isolated case. We saw similar scenes in my home country, the United Kingdom, last year when Excel Airways went bankrupt, leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket, without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout Europe, with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home.Many of these people are not regular business flyers or regular flyers like ourselves, and they do not have the financial means to deal with this sort of upheaval. They are normally from those families who spend their savings on a family holiday, only to see their hard-earned money go down the drain through little fault of their own.The status quo here is clearly not acceptable. Here in the European Union and the European Parliament, we should be proud of our record on passenger rights. We have seen the introduction of denied boarding compensation - although we know there are still issues to resolve with that. We have seen the introduction of rights to assistance and tougher laws on ticket pricing transparency, as well as tough compensation measures in the package travel directive. In fact, I believe we have covered most of the bases when it comes to consumer protection in aviation, but there is clearly a loophole here that needs to be closed.If you book a charter with a holiday company you are covered by the package travel directive. If you book with a scheduled airline, you are covered by their system, but if you book online your seat only - the airline flight - then you are not covered. It is an anomaly. It is a loophole which Parliament, with the assistance of the Commission, is seeking to close.In this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund, but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or by the Commission. We merely wish to open up the debate as to what mechanisms might be possible to help us best solve this problem, so the idea of the question is to start the dialogue with the Commission in the hope that we can close this loophole and find a solution to what is a serious problem, particularly for those people who find themselves victims of an airline insolvency.I look forward to working with the Commission to try and find a solution to this problem with my committee, and to hearing the views of the other Members.\nPERSON250 : Madam President, I am grateful to Mr Simpson and to the entire Committee on Transport and Tourism for bringing such a sensitive issue to the attention of Parliament. This question gives me an opportunity to reiterate formally what has been said in recent weeks following the hardships faced by many European citizens, by many passengers, as a result of the bankruptcy of certain airlines.As this Parliament knows, the protection of passengers in all transport sectors is a genuine priority for me. I said it during the hearing, when Parliament gave me its vote of confidence, and I wish to repeat it this evening. I believe that we must all take action to come up with a specific legal solution, not least to prevent - as Mr Simpson said - passengers who have purchased an ordinary flight ticket from an airline that subsequently goes bankrupt being treated differently from passengers who have bought their ticket as part of a more comprehensive package holiday.I therefore believe that the first thing to do is to use the resources that we already have at our disposal. In other words, the public must use all the regulations in the most effective way possible, even if they are incomplete and also lead to disparities. With the same aim of optimising the resources available to us, when the airline SkyEurope went bankrupt, for example, the network of European consumer protection centres was called in to advise consumers about their rights and to collect claims. However, we also need to offer better protection to passengers when an airline goes bankrupt. Passengers with bookings that subsequently lapse must be entitled to reimbursement and, in some cases, to repatriation. This is a complicated problem, which means we need to carefully appraise the measures to be adopted.The Commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues. At our request, a major study has already been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector, particularly those for passengers. This detailed study explains in practical terms the consequences of bankruptcies and their impact on the 700 million or more passengers transported every year throughout the European Union.The study offers various possible scenarios for defining the best solutions to the various problems raised by bankruptcies, particularly in terms of reimbursement and repatriation, as I just mentioned. As far as both reimbursement and repatriation are concerned, it has been possible to formulate various scenarios, ranging from the setting up of guarantee funds to the development of compulsory insurance schemes for passengers or airlines, and, ultimately, to the idea of introducing targeted changes in national bankruptcy laws.In February this year, I sent the study to Mr Costa, who chaired the Committee on Transport and Tourism at the time. The Commission is now continuing to analyse the various possible options on the basis of this study and is focusing in particular on the impact on consumers and on the air transport sector. During our analysis, we will take into account all aspects of the debate and will take advantage of contributions from all interested parties. Along the same lines, in the coming weeks, the Commission will set in motion a wide-ranging public consultation process on passenger rights in the air transport sector.Within this context, and without underestimating the differences and the specific features of package holidays, the Commission will also take into account the impact assessment currently being carried out on the review of Directive 90/314 relating precisely to package holidays. This is because one of the main aims of the public consultation process will be to determine the consequences for passengers of airlines going bankrupt and the possible solutions for remedying this. Obviously, as well as the public consultation, a study will be carried out - as I have already mentioned - to analyse the impact of the various possible solutions.Obviously, Parliament's contribution will be crucial as far as I am concerned and - in view also of the dedication with which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has worked together to come up with this oral question today - I believe that over the coming weeks, we will be able to cooperate usefully in order to identify together the best solution for meeting passengers' needs and for safeguarding their rights effectively should airlines go bankrupt.\nPERSON251 : During the current global economic crisis, with fluctuating fuel prices and a tougher competitive environment, airline operators, particularly low-cost airlines, are going through very difficult times. Increasing ticket prices is not an option in the current situation, while the increase in service charges being applied by some low-cost companies may result in an even sharper drop in the number of passengers.The financial losses sustained by airlines in 2009 will amount to approximately USD 11 billion, a situation which is set to recover only in the next three years. Against this background, the situation has arisen, which no one wants to see, where airlines are going bankrupt. In the event of bankruptcy due to lack of adequate legislation, there is no practical means of recovering the equivalent value of the tickets or getting passengers left stranded abroad flown home. The support offered by European airlines at a cost, although a modest one, to passengers with a company which has gone bankrupt, as highlighted in the case of SkyEurope, is laudable in itself, but only provides a temporary solution to get through a particular crisis. On the other hand, we cannot always consider the economic crisis itself as an excuse for this predicament, as airlines went bankrupt even before this crisis was unleashed.Tighter controls on the airline carriers' financial situation, especially in the case of low-cost companies, a tighter control on mergers and takeovers, as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund, are a few of the solutions which could, in the long term, offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy.\nPERSON252 : Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group has been pressing for a debate on the problem of the bankruptcies in the aviation sector, as it is true that we are no longer talking about an isolated case. As my colleague, Mr Simpson, the Chairman of our committee, has already mentioned, there have been 77 bankruptcies - mainly smaller companies, it is true - since 2000, which also means that many thousands of people have seen the money spent on their ticket go up in smoke in one way or another, or have just been left to fend for themselves somewhere. There is reason to fear that other bankruptcies may well follow, in these difficult economic times for the aviation sector. Hence, we must do something.It is true, of course, that Member States must also play a role in monitoring the creditworthiness and financial fitness of the airlines - this is right and proper - but it is for us to develop a protective mechanism at European level to ensure that the stranded passengers are not left out in the cold. Therefore, we call on the Commission to work faster towards presenting a specific proposal; particularly because, as you pointed out, systems are already in place thanks to all manner of other legislation - including for people booking package travel - in the form of a guarantee fund and so on. Thus, in a way, there is a disparity between those booking a flight via a tour operator and those booking their ticket online; and this, I believe, is another thing we need to resolve.I hear that you are in the process of consulting the interested parties. You intend to present a proposal over the next year. I think that we really do need to try to step up the pace of our action: instead of waiting until the end of next year, we should perhaps seek a solution somewhat sooner. Therefore, let us talk about a specific legislative proposal without delay, so that we can organise a discussion on the practical details of a kind of bankruptcy insurance.Finally, I should like to say that I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say we can expect a kind of general statement on passenger rights in the aviation sector. We know that the current legislation is not being applied fully, evenly or satisfactorily across the board, which is something that requires our attention, and I am sure that we shall be coming back to this.\nPERSON253 : Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for your response. I am also a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I think it is very important that we have this issue on the agenda now. Indeed, Mr Simpson has already presented it to us.As it stands, there is a gap in consumer protection where air passengers are concerned. This gap relates to the insolvency of airlines, as has already been discussed. In my opinion, it is extremely important to uphold consumer rights, and that is what we are doing. We are trying to protect consumers as far as possible.I would like to mention one other aspect from the point of view of our group which has not been a factor in this up to now, but which I think is also an important consideration. Of course, we want consumer rights to be protected, but we also want consumers to have choice. When considering how we can close this gap, it may well be the case that a proposal that you draw up in the Commission will result in over-regulation, which may then hinder innovation when it comes to the options offered in this area.Consumer law also means, of course, that there should be a choice between various different offers from airlines, for example. Thus, the trend now, for example, is for some very cheap flights to be on offer in place of some flat-rate journeys, something which is also very much welcomed by consumers.Please do not misunderstand me; I do not want to diminish consumer rights in any way. Protection of these rights, too, is very important to me, and we do need an appropriate instrument to do this. However, we should consider the perspectives that we need to take into account to ensure that there indeed remains a large degree of choice when it comes to air travel and that new options can come onto the market, but that consumers are nevertheless protected and are not left with any sort of financial problems if an airline were to actually go bankrupt or has to file for bankruptcy.In this regard, I am pleased to hear you say that you are working on a solution. The direction was, of course, clear in that there may also be an aid fund. I am looking forward to the discussion in committee, which may perhaps even take place this year.\nPERSON254 : Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial preconditions for market access for airlines have, of course, already been discussed in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. The issue of guarantee funds was brought up then, but it was clearly not considered sufficiently important or significant by the majority at that time.Now we are seeing cases which indeed give us cause for consideration and for regulation, because we need regulation in this area. Firstly, we need to continually ensure that the passenger rights that we are adopting here for the protection of consumers are complied with.The issue of denied boarding and the many cases of this that we have unfortunately seen show that any existing loopholes are utilised immediately. That requires our attention and it requires regulation. We will probably have to resort to the solution of a guarantee fund or some sort of insurance in order to adequately protect passengers from such business practices. We only need to look closely at the last case: even on the final day, there were still announcements stating that everything was alright and many people believed that.For this sort of solution, however, it must be guaranteed that all parties involved pay their fair share and that it does not result in a few airlines, including low cost airlines, sitting back in comfort and letting others bear the risk. A fair market will not only protect passengers from unfair practices, it will protect the competitors, too.\nPERSON255 : Madam President, over the last nine years, nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the European Union. We have heard here today how cut-price airline SkyEurope went bankrupt during the last holidays, leaving thousands of clients out of pocket. The situation is repeating itself. Of course, it is not the owners of private aircraft who suffer, but people who are often less well-off, who save for many months to buy a ticket to fly abroad. I think that, in this situation, the European Parliament, and I speak as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, must insist very strongly that the European Commission adopt principles for the legal protection of passengers and clients, and that also means financial protection. Creation of a special reserve for the compensation of passengers and clients of bankrupt airlines may prevent situations such as those we have seen in the last decade, when many thousands of people, at the very least, have lost their money once and for all. This is specific action which the citizens of Member States of the European Union expect of us.\nPERSON256 : I would like to thank Brian Simpson for his excellent introduction to this issue. A number of airlines have recently gone bankrupt in rapid succession. The problem has not been restricted to low-cost carriers, although these have accounted for most of the failures. If we fail to discuss the hundreds of passengers stranded in destinations from which it is difficult to get back home, nothing fundamental will happen. Various sectors of the industry have problems from time to time and a solution is generally found in the end. In this case, there are thousands of people involved, often with small children and without the appropriate funds. It is therefore necessary to give a clear signal that we know the solution. It is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journeys. I believe that the Commission and the EU Member States are capable of finding a rapid solution to passengers' problems. The problems of the airline companies will require a different solution, of course. The crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and I believe that these will be used.\nPERSON257 : Companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession and airline companies are no exception. In Lithuania, the Lithuanian airline 'FlyLAL' also filed for bankruptcy this year. It is one of tens of European airlines which went into bankruptcy this year. Although legislation adopted by the European Parliament provides sufficient guarantees and compensation for passengers, if, due to the fault of the airline, they are unable to take off on time on the planned route or have problems with luggage, this can only be guaranteed if the airline is not experiencing financial difficulties. Once a company has filed for bankruptcy, passengers who have purchased tickets usually lose all their money. Therefore, as national government institutions observe and licence the activities of airlines and give authorisation for flights, the Commission has recommended that where an airline goes bankrupt, governments could and should immediately return money to the airline's passengers for tickets they have purchased, then later recoup this by subrogation from the bankrupt company. We should also debate the proposal presented by Mr Simpson on a reserve compensation fund. This urgent problem can be debated and the best solution found by complementing the regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on general rules covering the supply of air transport services. Thus, we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlines' services.\nPERSON258 : (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the fact that the obligations of airlines to their passengers do not terminate even if the airline goes bankrupt is obvious, and should be taken as a starting point in this much needed discussion which Mr Simpson has initiated.Therefore, it was with amazement that I listened to the explanations of the SkyEurope spokesman. Ronald Schranz expressed regret at the inconvenience which had arisen for passengers. I stress the word 'inconvenience'. He also stated that clients of the bankrupt enterprise who were waiting at foreign airports would have to look themselves for alternative ways to get home. According to the spokesman, the matter concerned several thousand people, but he was not able to give their precise number. For the SkyEurope representative, this was only a statistic. He forgot, however, that included in that number were many thousands of personal dramas, of passengers who could not get home, to their family or to work. This example shows that it is necessary to regulate this matter as soon as possible. SkyEurope was a listed company, and so we had more information about it. In the case of other cut-price airlines, this is not always so. It may be that the recent Bratislava nightmare will be repeated at another European airport.At the moment, a heated discussion is in progress, in which different solutions to this important problem are being proposed. There is talk of a special fund created from a surcharge on air tickets, and also of bankruptcy insurance. These are valuable initiatives, but they are not without effect on the price of tickets. At a time of crisis we need a procedure which, on the one hand, will help passengers and, on the other, will not complicate the already difficult financial situation of airlines.I should like, therefore, to put a question and a proposal to the Commissioner: could a partial solution not be the idea of 'sky solidarity', which would incorporate the principle of joint responsibility of airlines for passengers? Yes, solidarity, an idea which is, to me, as a Pole, especially dear. It should be an answer and a challenge which can be applied immediately. My proposal is based on the idea that passengers of a bankrupt airline who are stranded at an airport would be able to use the aircraft of another airline flying in the same direction, on condition, of course, that there are vacant seats on board. Any costs involved would be settled between the airlines concerned. I would like to ask the Commissioner for a reply.\nPERSON259 : (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collapse of the airline company SkyEurope has focused attention on the general problem of poor consumer protection for airline company passengers. This is no virtual problem - I have had the opportunity to meet a number of customers affected by the collapse of this airline company in person. They were, by coincidence, guests from the French twin town of Chateau d'Ain, who had come for a meeting in Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e in the east of the Czech Republic, which is the town I represent. Their return journey was a very frustrating experience, involving an enforced one-day stopover at Prague airport.I mention this experience in order to emphasise that SkyEurope was not a normal low-cost airline. It offered its passengers similar services to those of a traditional airline and flew to major airports. Its services were used by a wide range of customers. For customers whose primary concern was not the date of the trip but rather the cost of the ticket, SkyEurope was the preferred choice in the Czech Republic. The SkyEurope company was also one the most important clients for Prague-Ruzyn\u011b, the Czech Republic's largest airport. The collapse of SkyEurope, however, affected not only people at airports, but also 280 000 other clients who had bought tickets. According to the information available, air tickets were being sold right up to the moment when bankruptcy was declared.People who did not purchase tickets with a credit card have practically no chance of recovering their money. Airline companies have no legal obligation to insure against a collapse and so some of them do not take out such insurance. Passengers must therefore make their claims in bankruptcy proceedings. The chances of getting money back in this way are negligible. It is therefore time to do something about this. I would like to thank the Committee on Transport for taking ownership of this issue and the Commission for promising to deal with it. I am confident that a solution will be put forward that will boost customer confidence in the air transport sector, which has been so dramatically affected by the global economic crisis.\nPERSON260 : (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the large bankruptcies of airline companies this year force us to consider again whether the unified internal market for air transport is functioning properly. Although several major carriers have gone bust and the situation in the sector continues to deteriorate due to rising fuel costs and slower economic growth, there is definitely no reason for panic, in my opinion. Before we launch ourselves down the slippery slope of regulation, we should remember that the EU has seen a major expansion of low-cost carriers in air transport and fiercer competition between all EU airlines thanks to liberalisation measures.A formerly highly-regulated industry with costly air tickets has been transformed into a dynamic sector with services which, thanks to the affordable prices in the EU, are being used by ever greater numbers of passengers who, in former times, would not have been able to afford them. Let us therefore consider carefully how we can increase protection for consumers - in this case airline customers - without putting at risk an efficient air transport market. The idea of introducing compulsory insurance against bankruptcy for airlines has already been proposed in the European Parliament in the recent past. It is therefore right to consider how this proposal might be put into effect.\nPERSON261 : (FR) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question we are debating this evening reveals, as many have said, the existence of a real legal vacuum, which leaves passengers with no guarantee should an airline go bankrupt.Certainly, European legislation protects passengers who have purchased their ticket as part of a package holiday, but it does not protect those who buy their ticket on the Internet. As Mr El Khadraoui said, consumer behaviour has evolved with the development of the Internet, and the legislator must follow this evolution in order to protect our fellow European citizens. A large number of travellers now buy their flight tickets on the Internet. Given that low-cost companies sell their tickets almost exclusively online, it is young people and people on the lowest incomes who are particularly affected by this phenomenon. It is not acceptable that these passengers have no recourse if the airline they bought their ticket from goes bankrupt. All the more so because, in the last few months, the air transport sector has experienced an unprecedented crisis leading to a significant reduction in air travel. We all know that this crisis is worse that that which affected the sector after 11 September and that numerous airlines have gone bankrupt.It is therefore essential that the European Commission - and I know, Vice-President, that you are aware of this - presents us with genuine solutions, as soon as possible, so that we can protect passengers if the airline they were due to fly with goes bankrupt, regardless of the means by which they booked their ticket.\nPERSON262 : (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased with the question that we are debating today, but I think that it only covers one of the possible cases where a company ceases to operate: that of financial collapse or insolvency.There are, however, other kinds of situation in which airlines may stop operating or suspend their activities. I am referring to cases in which their licence is suspended for safety reasons, voluntary closure or closure for any reason other than a financial one. These situations bring with them identical problems to those that we are discussing today, where passengers are left helpless, since either the cost of their flights is not reimbursed or, if it is, in some cases this reimbursement involves significant costs.I think that the regulation on compensation for passengers in the event of delay or cancellation could be one of the instruments to be used, but I do not believe it is enough.In this context, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the possibility of putting forward legislative measures for other cases - the cases that I mentioned - which go beyond airline collapse and which are not covered by the Community legislation in force. Otherwise, we run the risk, despite all our good intentions, of falling short and only providing legal cover for one specific situation, while leaving out many passengers who may also suffer through the closure of an airline, even though the reason for its closure is not economic or financial.\nPERSON263 : (RO) If we want to have an efficient internal market, we need to have a Community consumer protection policy. Over the years, the European Union has taken relevant actions in this area, and the measures adopted have ensured an increase in the level of consumer protection in areas such as package holiday services and passengers' rights.However, a large majority of the complaints received from European consumers relate to the violation of airline passengers' rights. Many of these complaints come from passengers whose flights have been cancelled due to the airlines or tour operators going bankrupt. In these cases, consumers become aware of the problems only when the flight is not operated as scheduled.Although European Union Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package holidays protects passengers if the tour operator goes into liquidation, it does not protect them for airline tickets sold on an individual basis. In addition, in the event of denied boarding, compensation is excluded in the case of extraordinary circumstances, which also includes airline bankruptcy. According to a recent survey, the number of airline bankruptcies in the European Union between 2000 and 2008 rose to 79. 41% of the airlines which went bankrupt between 2005 and 2008 operated regional flights, while 17% were low-cost airlines.What kind of action could we take, therefore, to provide better protection to passengers in such circumstances? Possible solutions include a passenger insurance scheme to cover these scenarios, a tighter system of supervision, as well as the drafting of legislative provisions guaranteeing compensation to passengers in such situations.\nPERSON264 : Madam President, passengers' compensation in the case of airline bankruptcies is not only a question of money. It is related to even more serious issues such as safety, accessibility of services and competitiveness. In times of crisis, every economic field is in a precarious situation, and airline transport is no exception to that. It is crucial not to let people's confidence in the operators waver, because this would lead to a considerable decrease in demand and thus would weaken even more the financial situation of airlines. This may influence Europe's whole economic situation and competitiveness.Passengers' compensation is also in relation to the accessibility of services. I believe that every person in Europe must have the choice to travel by air if he or she so wishes. For this, you must admit that we need safe but low-cost airlines that are affordable for everyone. These airlines should have a stable financial background, because safety does not only mean safety in case of an accident but also implies that, if I purchase an air ticket, I should be confident that by the time of the trip, there will actually be an aeroplane to take me to my destination.All this gives our oral question its importance, and the fact that there have been almost 80 airline bankruptcies in Europe since 2000 gives it urgency. The need for a clear regulation in this field is evident. Therefore, I would kindly ask the Commissioner to seriously consider this matter and come up with a viable solution as soon as possible.\nPERSON265 : (PL) Madam President, Mr Tajani, about a month ago, a budget airline became insolvent, and the airline - SkyEurope - presented a bankruptcy petition. Despite the fact that air industry analysts had been predicting this bankruptcy for a long time, SkyEurope was, nevertheless, still selling tickets for its flights the day before presentation of the bankruptcy petition. As a result, hundreds of the airline's passengers were denied not only the opportunity of making the journeys they had planned but, above all, they were exposed to significant financial losses caused by the airline's collapse. The firm simply informed its clients, in an official statement, that they would have to write off the money they had invested in their tickets.The example of SkyEurope demonstrates unambiguously that, in our common Europe, we have not yet succeeded in drafting legislation which would protect consumers of air services from the negative consequences of the collapse of an airline. This is a significant problem, which can be seen from the fact that 77 airlines have gone bankrupt around the world since 2000. For example, in 2004, the Polish airline Air Polonia went bankrupt. Therefore, I would like the Commission to present principles for the protection of consumers from the negative consequences of possible airline bankruptcies.\nPERSON266 : Madam President, Mrs De Veyrac, Mr Vlas\u00e1k and Mrs Gurmai focused attention on the cause of bankruptcy, in other words, the economic crisis and the difficulties currently faced by the air transport sector, by both low-cost airlines and major airlines.The European Parliament and the Commission have acted in unison to launch a set of initiatives in response to the crisis. I refer to the freezing of slots, supported by the vast majority of this Parliament, and the Single European Sky initiative, which is a large-scale reform of the air transport system that enables airlines to save on fuel costs because we have reduced the legs between one airport and another.Precisely in order to provide practical support to all European airlines, be they low-cost or non low-cost airlines, I have called on the 27 transport ministers in the European Union to introduce the Single European Sky reform ahead of schedule, because this is a good way to allow airlines to save fuel and therefore to prevent their balance sheets from being adversely affected. Preventing airlines from going bankrupt would not only protect passengers against loss but would, above all, be extraordinarily important when it comes to protecting jobs. We must not forget that this financial and economic crisis should not be allowed to become a full-blown social crisis.We know that the air transport sector is beset by problems at international level: we need only think of what happened to Japan Airlines a few weeks ago, when staff cuts were announced. It should be our duty not only to safeguard citizens but also act to ensure that good airlines can remain operational, thus safeguarding jobs.The European Commission - and please excuse me if I digress - and Parliament have worked to make this possible. I can state that, through our efforts, we have made it possible to create a new completely private airline model: examples include the case of Olympic Airways, the case of Alitalia and the case - which I hope will be resolved - of Austrian Airlines This means that there are no more state-controlled airlines that have to be bailed out by the public when they get into trouble. Instead, whoever makes the mistakes must pay for them.I would also like to respond to the question raised by Mrs Alvarez, who raised a topic that is certainly interesting: I think I can agree with her proposal adding, in the work we are carrying out, the suggestion that safeguards should also be given to the passengers of airlines that shut down not due to bankruptcy but because they do not comply with safety requirements. In this particular case, the passenger suffers the same loss as a passenger who bought a ticket from an airline that subsequently went bankrupt. The principle must remain that of safeguarding the travelling public when they suffer a loss, in other words, when they cannot board their flight. Moreover, this is the philosophy that underpins - and will continue to underpin - my efforts as long as I remain a Commissioner, so that passengers can be offered the same safeguards in all transport sectors.For this reason, at the Transport Council due to be held in Luxembourg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, we will tackle the question of the rights of sea and river transport passengers. This is a choice made by the Commission, with the support of Parliament, which is aimed at safeguarding European citizens. If we really wish to win public confidence and obtain the sort of positive results that were achieved in Ireland, we must legislate to show citizens that the Community institutions are on their side, that they are not simply gravy trains, but places where work is done to safeguard and protect the rights of European citizens.\nPERSON267 : The debate is closed. The vote on any motions for resolutions will take place during the next part-session.Written statements (Rule 149)\nPERSON268 : As a result of changing travel habits, an ever-increasing number of people are making their own travel arrangements, without availing themselves of the services of travel agencies. Low-cost airlines have been the winners from this trend over the last decade, in terms of both revenue and market share. Fellow Members, the regular bankruptcy of travel agencies used to be a cause for concern in Hungary as well. We would regularly see on television pictures of families stranded abroad. We must not let the next wave of bankruptcies sweep away the low-cost firms, causing millions of euros of damage to the economy as well as to passengers, not to mention the safety risk, if a company does not have a secure financial basis to support its operation.This is precisely why we must focus on the following objectives. We must think about tightening the rules on setting up companies. In the case of airlines, further capital and structural guarantees must be required. We must think about tightening up the system for financial and operating accounts and about how frequently spot-checks should be carried out. The size of this sector warrants that regular European surveys should analyse the companies' flight policy, complaint-handling mechanism and the simplicity of the refund procedure. We must make it even easier to deal with cross-border complaints relating to similar matters in the future. If we really want to create a common market in Europe with the consumer's welfare at its heart, we must deal with cross-border complaints and compensation claims more efficiently."

"transcript": "PERSON019 : The final version of the draft order of business as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 17 September 2009 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.Mrs Bauer's report on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities has been rejected following a vote in committee.In addition, the following reports were not received in time:Mr B\u00f6ge's reportson mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund: Italy, the Abruzzo earthquake andon mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Germany - telecommunications sector, andMrs Haug's report - Draft amending budget 9/2009: earthquake in Italy.These four reports have, therefore, been removed from the order of business.\nPERSON020 : Mr President, as regards the two reports on the use of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the benefit of the telecommunications industry in Germany and the Solidarity Fund for the tragedy which occurred in Abruzzo in Italy, the Committee on Budgets adopted the four reports at the beginning of the week, but not in time for translations to be prepared. I merely wished to correct what you said: these reports have been adopted in committee. There is no legal obstacle. They were even adopted unanimously.\nPERSON021 : Thank you for that comment. It is a pertinent comment. Nonetheless, these reports are not on the order of business, because they have not yet been translated. There was not enough time. I share your opinion entirely. I am sorry. I went too far in what I said.Before Mr Lamassoure's statement, I made two proposals for changes. The first was for the Council statement on the situation in Guinea to be placed on the agenda as the second item. The second was about voting on motions for resolutions on passenger compensation. I would like to ask if there are any motions on these matters? We do not want to confuse items.\nPERSON022 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, and also speaking on behalf of Mr La Via, I would like to take the floor briefly just to express our disappointment over the postponement of the vote on mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the Abruzzo region. The vote has been postponed by two weeks and will take place during the part-session in Strasbourg.Although we realise that there are technical reasons for it, we also understand that some people are still living in tents - and L'Aquila and its region, Abruzzo, are some of the coldest areas in Italy.We simply wish to emphasise the importance of changing and streamlining the procedures for mobilising this fund.\nPERSON023 : We must act in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. It was difficult to do the translations in such a short time, and the rule which we apply in such a case is deferral of the matter. I am also very sorry about this, but I would like us to proceed and work through our agendas item by item, because otherwise we will end up with enormous confusion.A moment ago, I asked about two things: the Council statement on the situation in Guinea, and voting on motions for resolutions on passenger compensation. Are there any questions about this?There are no questions. The discussion is closed.(Parliament accepted these proposals)\nPERSON024 : (IT) Mr President, my apologies for going back to the subject of Abruzzo. It is true that we all have respect for people who have suffered an earthquake, but we cannot celebrate only when things happen and not respond when it is within our means to do so.I agree with Mrs Matera and call on the Chamber, which remains sovereign, to approve the release of the Solidarity Fund, without translation if necessary. I do not believe that problems of this type should exist when we have tragic situations to deal with.(Applause)\nPERSON025 : Colleagues, those remarks were very important. We must overcome these difficulties. I will ask the services whether it is possible to deliver some crucial translations by tomorrow, and then we can vote tomorrow as well. It is a very urgent decision.(Applause)It is, of course, against our rules, but I think this time we should do it, so it will be organised.In connection with the Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy, I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this item to be withdrawn from the order of business.\nPERSON027 : Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I call for Parliament to make a statement on the withdrawal of the debate on freedom of the press in Italy and then on the vote on a resolution on the same subject. Every person of good faith knows that my group, the PPE, is deeply attached to the defence of freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.(Protests)(Applause)Please respect my freedom of speech. I have always respected it in this House and I have always respected my fellow citizens here in Parliament.(Applause)That is why we did everything we could for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become binding under the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the debate scheduled for tomorrow only targets one country and does not cover the question - on which we are prepared to have an in-depth debate - of freedom of the press in Europe. The PPE refuses to allow this Parliament to become a place in which purely national political accounts are settled, which is what we shall witness tomorrow if this debate goes ahead.(Protests)(Applause)So yes to the defence of the liberty of the press in Europe, but no to this Parliament being used for purely partisan and national ends. I shall repeat tomorrow, as you will see, what was said by President Napolitano, who is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect, because I have worked a lot with him, as you will see tomorrow.\nPERSON028 : Mr President, I do not have much to add to the proposal made by Mr Daul in his speech. We all love freedom in its various forms, including freedom of expression and press freedom in the broadest sense, in other words, not only the written press but also television and other media. It is therefore right that we defend it and support it.It is not right, however, to exploit the situation by pointing the finger at just one set of circumstances, because anyone in Italy who logs on to the Internet, goes to a news-stand or watches the TV, can see that freedom of the press is under no threat whatsoever. To sum up, if you really wish to accuse someone, use Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure and Article 7 of the Treaties and have the courage to follow it through to the end.\nPERSON029 : Mr President, Mr Daul is quite right in what he has just said. Yes, it is true that Mr Daul is someone who respects all aspects of the freedom of expression. He is well-known for this. However, there are clearly some people in Europe who do not respect the freedom of expression to the same extent as Mr Daul does, but instead have a different understanding of the freedom of expression. That is why we need this debate.We therefore believe it to be appropriate, given the debate that is going on in one of the Member States, namely Italy, although not only on account of the Italian situation, but on account of the question of whether, as a result of the concentration of economic, political and media power to an extent the like of which we have not known in Europe before, freedom of expression poses a risk to democratic development in Europe. That is precisely the point that we want to discuss. We should therefore do that and reject the motion proposed by Mr Daul.(Applause)\nPERSON031 : The Commission statement on freedom of information in Italy shall remain on the order of business.I have received another request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) that the debate not be wound up with the tabling of motions for resolutions.\nPERSON032 : Mr President, Mr Daul, we are a parliament that should, quite rightly, vote on and take responsibility for providing money for the people in Abruzzo as quickly as possible.We are also a parliament with a responsibility. When we debate something, we must subsequently vote on a resolution so that the debate serves a purpose. We are therefore in favour of adopting a resolution after this debate.(Applause)\nPERSON033 : Mr President, I wish to speak in support of the motion for there not to be a resolution because I heard Mr Schulz say something which, in my view, is very important: if we really want this debate to encompass 'Europe' and not just Italy, there is no point then voting on a resolution entitled 'Freedom of information in Italy'.Let us, in any case, have the debate tomorrow: subsequently, we will find the time and the means to address the issue in the context of Europe and vote on a resolution on the freedom of information in Europe."

"transcript": "PERSON129 : (SL) I would like to comment on the remarks made at the beginning of voting when fellow members attempted to use the unplanned event at the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power station as an illustration of the unsafe performance of nuclear power plants. I should point out that the event was indeed unplanned, that it involved a component failure, that the plant was not shut down but rather had its operations safely suspended, and that repairs on it are under way. The operation of the power station is transparent and fellow members can find information on it on the website of the country's nuclear safety administration. I should also add that by all performance indicators the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power station is one of the safest nuclear power plants in the world."

As we see, we have achieved a broad consensus in favour.\nPERSON098 : Well, we have not voted yet, but I hope that you are right.\nPERSON099 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, we have already held the debate on this item in Strasbourg, so I do not need to discuss it further today. For the so-called 12-day trips, we have achieved an excellent cross-party compromise, also with the submission of the outcomes of the social partners' negotiations. Indeed, we could say that we have improved upon the social partners' compromise here in the House. I hope that we will thus be able to conclude this matter very successfully with broad support.May I also point out that the English text of Amendment 31 should be put to the vote, as I have noticed that a very important word has been omitted from the French and German texts.\nPERSON100 : The various language versions will be checked."

"transcript": "PERSON088 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before all of you, as far as possible, vote in favour of this report, I would like to give you some brief information and voice an appeal to the Council which, yet again, is absent. The Member States and the European Union wish to, and must, take more ambitious and effective action against corruption. That is why the European Parliament has endorsed the establishment of a contact-point network against corruption. The lead committee, at least, has voted unanimously in favour of such a move.The purpose of the network is, firstly, to foster cooperation among the authorities and agencies in the Member States and, secondly, to encourage the exchange of data on effective strategies. However, the Council proposal before us is quite simply too lacking in ambition and is toothless and thus redundant as it stands. Parliament has therefore tabled a number of very significant amendments, with unanimous support, as I said, being achieved in committee.Firstly, OLAF, Europol and Eurojust should be integral parts of this network, which is why we are asking for their participation to be mandatory. Secondly, the network should submit an annual report to the European Parliament on its activities, with practical proposals on how to improve the prevention and combating of corruption. Thirdly, the costs of all of the network members should be borne from the Community budget, so as to ensure the independence of the network as a whole.I therefore urge the Council to incorporate Parliament's proposals and establish the contact-point network swiftly, for this would give us a unique opportunity finally to achieve a joint strategy for the European Union and establish an appropriate mechanism to combat corruption."

"transcript": "PERSON074 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission triggered the radioactive risk alert system yesterday following an incident at Krsko in Slovenia, the details of which remain sketchy. The alert was made public via a procedure that has been described as unusual, but its causes and its consequences are still totally confused and unclear.We therefore call on the Slovenian Presidency-in-Office and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency urged by the Commission, and to tell the European Parliament and the public what really happened and what is happening now, because a number of rumours are currently circulating which are neither clear nor wholly unambiguous. We therefore demand the necessary clarification from the European authorities.\nPERSON075 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague's request. We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past. Maximum transparency is required, not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter. As far as my country is concerned, we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia, which moreover currently holds the presidency.\nPERSON076 : We have heard from two speakers on this item and I think that is sufficient.\nPERSON077 : Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on 1 June, on the basis of information received through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) system and guided by the principle of precaution, the Commission released a public statement about the alert message from Slovenia at 17.38 local time. This concerned the loss of coolant that occurred in the primary cooling system of the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant in south-west Slovenia.According to the last information received from the Slovenian authorities, the reactor of the nuclear power plant of Kr\u0161ko was completely shut down on Wednesday, 4 June at 19.30. The relatively small leakage remained within the containment building. The Slovenian authorities have confirmed that there has been no discharge to the environment. The situation can be considered fully under control.The Commission immediately transmitted this information to all Member States according to the procedure and released a second public statement. The information about the incident came from the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange system. The ECURIE system requires that Member States promptly notify the Commission and all the Member States potentially affected when they intend to take counter measures if necessary, in order to protect the population against the effects of a radiological or nuclear accident. The European Community needs to immediately forward this notification to all Member States.All the 27 Member States, as well as Switzerland, have signed the ECURIE agreement. The Commission emphasises that the ECURIE system is an information-sharing system about nuclear incidents, and the Commission considers that a full transparency approach is the most appropriate response in cases of nuclear incidents.\nPERSON078 : (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recently obtained radiation measurement data from a radioactivity measuring station in Kr\u0161ko which show that in fact, an astonishing peak in radiation levels was recorded the day before the alarm was sounded. There has to be an explanation for that.\nPERSON079 : With that, we close that particular item. The Commission will take note. We will now proceed with our normal business.(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"

"transcript": "PERSON091 : rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present, not just because of the increase in the price of diesel, for which sustainable, global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions, but also because of the poor management of fisheries resources, over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase in the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market.This highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector, which is feeling the full force of this unfair competition.The proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable, responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living.This report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries. Our aim today is to send a strong signal to the Council, to the most closely involved Member States, which must today take full responsibility and implement the necessary rapid, effective measures. I am counting on your determination."

"transcript": "PERSON077 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Article 170(4), I request on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that the final vote on the resolution and the report be postponed until the next plenary sitting.It became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so. Many Members are hoping that, after years of deadlock, the agreement will enable a new quality of dialogue between the European Union and Turkmenistan. However, for the majority of Members it is important that we do not give the Commission and the Council a free ride. As Parliament, we need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that, if the human rights situation continues to worsen, at the request of Parliament serious consideration will be given to the suspension of the agreement. Yesterday, the Commission unfortunately only conditionally agreed and the Council did not agree at all to this demand. I therefore request, on behalf of my Group, that both final votes be postponed until we have the corresponding commitments from the Council and the Commission.(Applause)\nPERSON078 : In accordance with Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, it was a political group that just spoke. The procedure asks whether a speaker wishes to speak for or against.\nPERSON079 : on behalf of the PSE-Group. - Mr President, I totally agree with our colleague, Mr Caspary, that we should postpone not only the final vote on the resolution but also the vote on his report - the assent report - because it was very clear in yesterday's debate that the Council in particular was not prepared to give the European Parliament sufficient opportunity and the possibility to really monitor the situation in Turkmenistan and have an impact on the situation there on the basis of such an agreement. Since we did not get sufficient guarantees, we also support Mr Caspary's proposal to postpone these votes.\nPERSON080 : I shall put the request for postponement to the vote.(Parliament decided to postpone the final vote)\nPERSON083 : (DE) Mr President, the request was for the final votes only to be postponed, not the vote on the amendments.\nPERSON084 : We in the services were not in receipt of this information. Only the final vote shall be postponed, then. I should point out that we are going to vote first on the amendments.\nPERSON085 : (DE) Mr President, my request was to postpone only the two final votes and for us to vote on the amendments so we only need hold the final votes in one of the forthcoming plenary sittings.\nPERSON086 : In fact, this is absolutely not what the services had understood, but we shall of course go along with our rapporteur.Therefore, if I have understood correctly, we are going to vote on the amendments to the report on Turkmenistan, not to your report. Then we shall stop before the final vote.- Before the vote on Amendment 2\nPERSON087 : (FR) Mr President, the excellent amendment tabled by my group and which will enable us to carry real weight in the area of human rights would be further improved if we replaced 'the prospect of signing the Agreement' with 'the prospect of finalising the process of ratifying the Agreement', which is the appropriate phrase.\nPERSON088 : This is a legal point.Can those Members who oppose it please stand up?I cannot see 40 Members standing up. Therefore, we shall include what Mrs Flautre said, and I shall now record this paragraph as having been orally amended.(The oral amendment was accepted)"

"transcript": "PERSON067 : Mr President, it would be most interesting if we could compare the vote on the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the alternative motions for resolutions by 40 members and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. We would find:firstly, that a total of 15 proposals have been amended without sending out any message;secondly, that over and above the quantitative issue there is also the political issue, with the alternative proposal deleting every reference to the role and responsibility of the large commercial retail and wholesale chains;thirdly, that the written statement by the European Parliament with its 439 signatures by members who want branches to be controlled and to operate properly lapses by default; andfourthly, that every unfair trading policy has been deleted or embellished and that it even goes as far as to refuse the recommendation to create a Europe-wide database on farm gate and consumer prices which is accessible to all citizens and consumers.The objective of the Committee on Agriculture and of the High Level Group is to examine competitive practices and the transparency of the internal market in the food sector. Today we are all being judged.\nPERSON068 : (FR) Mr President, it is all the same astounding, that statement.I simply wished to say to my fellow Members that I am one of the authors of the alternative resolution. We are in the European Union, not the Soviet Union.(Applause)\nPERSON069 : I am sure, Mrs Lulling, that this detail had not escaped the Members of this House, but I gave the floor to our rapporteur because she did not have the opportunity to speak during the debates.

Is that correct?\nPERSON094 : I can confirm that, if an oral amendment is to be adopted, it must be expressed orally, which has not been the case, in spite of my request. You have therefore understood perfectly."

Furthermore, after five years of working on this issue, I wish to inform Members that I will be voting against both alternative motions for resolution and voting in favour of the Auken report.(Applause)\nPERSON073 : rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups. I would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work. As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter. It has, of course, had a huge effect on the lives of tens of thousands of EU citizens living in Spain and has affected both the Spanish countryside and the Spanish economy. The report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two-thirds majority. It is a comprehensive text, which differentiates between the many different aspects of Spanish urbanisation.There is the problem of the fundamental rights of European citizens, which include the right to lawfully acquired property. The European Parliament has already committed itself to respecting these rights, and all Member States are bound by them. There is the problem of the disastrous impact of the extensive urbanisation on the environment, particularly in coastal areas and on the Spanish islands, but also in other areas such as around Madrid. There is the problem of the resurrection of the Spanish 1988 Coastal Law, which is now suddenly able to deny many people the right to live in their own homes - and in certain cases has even resulted in the demolition of these homes. Then there is the problem of the consequences of thousands of allegedly unlawful houses built with the approval of the municipalities but subsequently declared unlawful, whereby the innocent purchaser becomes the victim of corrupt urbanisation practices. Finally, there is the problem of the lack of legal certainty and appropriate compensation for the victims of the property scandals.I have no doubt about where the responsibility for these extensive infringements lies and I regret that these violations by municipal and regional authorities have undermined attempts by many others to create sustainable development, where a healthy economy goes hand in hand with respect for the environment and for cultural heritage. The report deserves a proper debate in which all opinions can be heard. It is unacceptable that our new rules prevent this. These rules must be changed as soon as possible, particularly when it comes to reports that deal with complaints from European citizens. I ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions. Although they are based on my report, they are not impartial. They do not reflect the detailed and factual assessments that the committee has voted on."

"transcript": "PERSON118 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, if I understood you correctly, you are indicating that the presidency does wish to apply the recast procedure to the Krahmer report today and the Cashman report. In that case, my group requests that we delay the vote until tomorrow so that we can study the implications of this.\nPERSON119 : Mr President, as I said earlier, I am in favour of this proposal, although I would like to point out that if amendments had not been tabled that go somewhat beyond what was adopted on the basis of a general compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this problem would not have arisen, since the compromise amendments were completely in keeping with the nature of this revision, namely a recast. If this had been the case, then we could have voted today, but we accept the deferral as it makes sense.\nPERSON120 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. -Mr President, it behoves Mr Watson, if he is making a suggestion that we should consider the recast implications, to explain to us now what the recast implications are. He might like to have a word with Mr Corbett before answering.I am fairly relaxed about this, but it would be much more sensible, since we are teed up to vote on this and we are unlikely to change our opinion on the actual voting - plus, minus or abstention - in the light of the recast procedures, to vote now when we have the time rather than hurry and add this vote to the list tomorrow when we have a lot of other things to do. Therefore, I am opposed to moving it.\nPERSON121 : Mr President, I am very pleased that the President has finally given the floor to the rapporteur. I am also quite surprised!At this time, we are still getting used to the recast rules. I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that the application of these rules is no surprise, even just before a vote. We have already applied these rules consistently in committee and it is only logical for them to be applied consistently in plenary.If we were to vote now, there would not be a single amendment and not a single compromise up for voting that have not been discussed. Everything is itemised on the voting list. For the same reason as Mr Sacconi, but with a different conclusion, I see absolutely no reason to postpone. We can vote now!(Applause)\nPERSON123 : Mr President, as we have decided to vote, maybe you could indicate why so many amendments were ruled to be inadmissible. That is the problem, and that is the point originally raised in relation to the recast versions under review. We do not understand why some amendments are inadmissible. Could you clarify that as we proceed to the vote?\nPERSON124 : I know in general terms what the issue is about, but I regret that I am unable to inform you of the specifics. We are now, however, voting on amendments which have gone through committee, which are regarded as admissible, which are substantive and which may or may not represent the view of the House.\nPERSON125 : (IT) Mr President, I would just like to say that today's episode clearly shows that the recasting agreement does not work and that it will affect our powers as a sovereign authority. That is the problem with this procedure, as we are now demonstrating so well.\nPERSON126 : Mr President, I am sorry to prolong this discussion, but may I build on what was just said by my colleagues, Mrs Doyle and Mrs Frassoni? As one of the authors of several of the amendments, I was in contact with the President's office until 11.50 and could not obtain a clear 'yes' or 'no' as to whether the amendments we tabled - 136 to 139 - would be voted upon or not. It was unclear, and the last word was that the vote would probably be postponed. As Avril Doyle said, we simply cannot understand why these amendments are inadmissible. In the interests of clarity, we should have some more time and have clarification from the President's office.\nPERSON127 : I am advised that it has been ruled on and only certain amendments have been declared admissible, as is normal in any House. I think it might be helpful if a statement is made tomorrow by the President taking the vote so that there is clarification. But we must proceed to the vote now. I am sorry for those who are disappointed.Before the vote on Amendment 88:\nPERSON128 : Mr President, on most of our voting lists, Amendments 88 and 89 are down as inadmissible and there is no indication as to how we should vote. Whilst you might well be wanting us to vote, we have a small problem with this, because we do not know what we are voting on and we do not know which way we should be voting.May I suggest that some more thought be given to this new procedure we are using for recast, because there seems to be a lack of coordination and communication around the different political groups.\nPERSON129 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can help you out here and even point out to the President what he himself decided. We now have Amendments 106, 139, 88 and 89. The President has ruled Amendment 88 admissible. You all have a note to that effect in the voting list. If not, you will have to speak to those responsible within your group. I am sorry for that.\nPERSON131 : Mr President, some of the amendments you ruled inadmissible were also ruled inadmissible by the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public health and Food Safety under the recast procedures. This Parliament has no right to introduce legislation. Its chance of influence is in amending legislation put before us. It seems that, in the way we have interpreted the recast procedures, we have castrated ourselves. Could you inform the President that if this Parliament is to demonstrate its true virility, we need to review these?"

"transcript": "PERSON114 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, careers in the performing arts are not immune from the continuing existence of major inequalities between men and women.As I have responsibilities in the arts, this is a subject close to my heart, as discrimination against women in the performing arts is still rife, particularly when it comes to senior positions: there are so few female directors in theatre, dance, opera and so on.For example, it is important to widen the practice of holding auditions behind a screen in recruiting orchestral musicians, by analogy with the existing business practice of viewing anonymous CVs, partly because it is the only way that women will get jobs as orchestral soloists and also because it is a good way of combating racial discrimination.Moreover, the balance between professional and family commitments is even more difficult for women in this sector, due to the unusual working hours connected with their profession, hence the need to have specific opening hours for cr\u00e8ches that meet the needs of artists.Ladies and gentlemen, Europe, as the ancestral home of culture, cannot continue to do nothing in the face of these problems that make it suffer."

The text should read: '[...] as well as internal security, particularly the fight against terrorism; immigration, demographic challenges [...]', instead of the old version '[...] as well as internal security, meaning particularly immigration, the fight against terrorism, demographic challenges [...]'.I would ask Parliament to support this oral amendment.\nPERSON138 : Mr President, in the text on the voting list, there is a comma between 'terrorism' and 'immigration', when we had agreed a semi-colon. You could not hear this when Mr Surj\u00e1n read his text. We would like to have that semi-colon between 'terrorism' and 'immigration'.\nPERSON140 : Mr President, what we are talking about here are 'diversified gas transport routes', and I would also add 'and resources', because:It is not only the gas routes, but also the gas sources that should be differentiated, and that would include here. If this amendment is rejected, that should be included in the original text.\nPERSON142 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I have no objection to this oral amendment by Mr Swoboda, which refers to the original text. In any case, I was told by the Tabling Office that this amendment is valid only for the amended one. If that is not so, I am in favour of this oral amendment being part of the original. Therefore, those who are following my advice will vote against the first part in this fifth vote and then we shall have an extra vote, which is not on the voting list, on this oral amendment, which I support.\nPERSON143 : Mr President, the oral amendment applies in both cases, but I know that the PPE-DE Group will vote differently on the split vote, so that does not change anything, I agree.\nPERSON145 : Mr President, we were not voting on Mr Swoboda's oral proposal, so if Parliament wishes to support his oral amendment, we should vote that this is still valid for the original text. Otherwise, we will have had four votes and rejected it, which requires five votes.\nPERSON146 : The oral amendment was incorporated in the first of the four votes. That is what it says on the voting list. It was incorporated in the first of the split votes and was rejected.\nPERSON147 : Mr President, no: in the voting list without the oral amendment, we were voting on the first part of the PSE Group amendment and that was rejected. In addition to the original PSE Group amendment, Mr Swoboda tabled putting the word 'sources'. I am neither against nor for. I am not complaining if the PSE Group is not complaining. I just want to clarify that according to my knowledge, the word 'sources' is not in the text.\nPERSON148 : That is correct.\nPERSON149 : Mr President, so we should have had a vote on whether we wanted it or not.\nPERSON150 : No. I asked if there were any objections to the oral amendment. There were none so it then formed part of the amendment which was voted on in the first roll-call vote and was rejected. That is the situation.Before the vote on paragraph 31:\nPERSON151 : Mr President, that will be very simple. I suggest replacing 'fears' in the original text with the word 'concerns'."

"transcript": "PERSON009 : The next item is the vote on the use of the urgent procedure for the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nPERSON010 : Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the request for application of the urgent procedure put before us this morning, in implementation of Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure, was submitted to us by the Council last week and relates, as you said, to the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.The aim of this proposal is to implement the new recovery plan, as recommended for these areas by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas at its meeting last November.As the Council pointed out in its request for application of the urgent procedure, this regulation needs to come into force before the start of the main fishing season on 15 April, which means that the obligatory consultation of this Parliament needs to be carried out in this plenary session so as to pave the way for a political agreement within the Council in the coming weeks.In view of this, and of the fact that the European Union needs to meet its international commitments and to do its part in the crucial efforts to deal with the acute crisis in bluefin tuna stocks, the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries has unanimously approved this request for application of the urgent procedure. I therefore encourage you to confirm this approval in this morning's vote.\nPERSON012 : (PT) Madam President, just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week. Wednesday 11 March is the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. This day was proposed in the first place by Parliament in a vote that took place on 11 March 2004. We were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom, security and justice. It was the day of the tragic attacks in Madrid. It was originally proposed for 11 September but, given the tragedy that occurred on that day, Parliament voted for it to be on 11 March.Several days later, on 25 March if my memory serves me correctly, the European Council adopted this date as European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. Yet now, we have a plenary sitting tomorrow - 11 March - and I see from the agenda that there is not even a memorial of any kind. I would like to know if something of this sort is planned for this week's part-session.\nPERSON013 : Mr Ribeiro e Castro, it is my understanding that the President will make a statement tomorrow at the opening of the plenary about the day you refer to and the special circumstances. This will play a part in that regard."

"transcript": "PERSON108 : rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to refer this report back to committee under Rule 168(2). Both this democratically elected Parliament and the European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries, actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation, such as exchange programmes between universities here and there.The budget for development is not meant for this kind of cooperation, but some Members insist on using a legal base that would lead us to finance these actions with the development budget while that is precisely what we seek to avoid with this report.We did not reach an agreement. If Amendment 1 is adopted, then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world's poorest people. I consider, therefore, that we should refer this report back to the Committee on Development in order to agree on a legal base having the support of a clear majority of this House.\nPERSON109 : (DE) Madam President, there are indeed differences of interpretation. The legal interpretation by the Committee on Development is opposed to the interpretation by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and it is opposed to the legal interpretation by the legal services of our Parliament, to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to the view of the Council and the Commission, and therefore we, in the majority, insist on using the legal base as set out in this amendment.I ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn. As regards the substance of the report there are no differences of opinion. We agree on the substance, it is only with regard to the legal interpretation that there are differences and a referral back to committee will not change those differences.\nPERSON110 : Madam President, I would like to second the rapporteur. Following the debate we had here yesterday, and in view of the Commission's contribution, I very much agree that we need more discussion and that we need to find a proper legal basis for actions that are not pure ODA actions - but are still very important for development cooperation with developing countries - and therefore do not fall under the other instruments regarding cooperation with industrialised countries, nor under the current DCI.It is also very important to freeze the money foreseen for the DCI for cooperation in accordance with ODA criteria, so I support our colleague Mr Berman in his request for more time for consideration."

I do not, therefore, intend to do this and will instead merely say that this is an example of how, once again, we are trying to make it easier for citizens to work and establish themselves across borders.This can form a nice little example to use in the election campaigns and I am therefore pleased. The committee was unanimous on this issue and so that is all I have to say."

"transcript": "PERSON054 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I apologise for interrupting the vote.Under Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure, I am asking the Members of the House to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the petitions process, as this matter is at present being dealt with in the Conference of Presidents in the context of the reform of the procedures of the House. The Conference of Presidents will discuss the very specific reform issues dealt with in the Onesta report at a meeting on 5 March 2009, and I am asking that, if possible, the vote on this report be postponed until the Strasbourg part-session in the second week of March. I am asking the House to approve this if possible.\nPERSON055 : rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, let us try to be precise. This report amends our regulation, or rather clarifies it, in order to make it clear how petitions to the Committee on Petitions are received or not received, how information is given to petitioners, and so on.It was approved unanimously, with one vote against I think, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I do not think, therefore, that this report is very controversial. There is, however, one article in which we had agreed to make it clear that if and when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, petitioners would simply be informed if a petition that were submitted not to Parliament but to the European Commission - you know, those petitions with millions of signatures - were connected to their petition.If I understand rightly, it is that article, because of the reference to a possible future treaty that causes a problem. Personally, I can live with postponing it until 5 March; I can even live with a 'speed vote' withdrawing that amendment. On the other hand, it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in the past. I am in your hands, ladies and gentlemen."

"transcript": "PERSON098 : rapporteur. - Madam President, I apologise for taking up everyone's time and delaying lunch but I do it only once in 10 years so maybe you will not mind. In fact I am like the Member of the Finnish Parliament who rose to speak only once in all his years in the Finnish Parliament and what he said was: 'could you close the window, please'.I would like to say a few words in relation to these three reports, which are all part of the same package, which includes the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Saryusz-Wolski. At the moment we are looking for solutions to the financial crisis. That was self-inflicted and we are saying this crisis must not be repeated, but what about the raison d'\u00eatre of the European Union to prevent wars and human crises? They must not be repeated either, and they do not fall on us like the roof in the Parliament building in Strasbourg. They need not be repeated, but only on the condition that we work together.I remind you that peace is not the monopoly of this side of the House. Peace belongs to everybody. Peace-building is our common duty. It is a little bit like love. It is unconditional. We have to be idealistic in this life. We have to look far away, like when we run in a forest. You do not look at your feet when you run in a forest. You look far away and then you know where you are going and you automatically put your feet in the right place. That is what we have to do. We have to be brutally honest and remember why the EU was formed: it was to build peace.All I am saying now is that, if we are to respect the inheritance of Mr Monnet and our forefathers, we should belong to just one party and that party regarding peace-building is called the '\"Yes I Can\u201d Party'. Only then will history give us a standing ovation. And the window is open.\nPERSON100 : rapporteur. - Madam President, I am sorry to take up Parliament's time. I simply wish to delete the following sentence regarding the EU Operational Headquarters from paragraph 29: 'emphasises that the proposed EU Operational Headquarters provides the solution to this problem;'.\nPERSON102 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I have two oral amendments to this paragraph. The first is that the words 'human rights and the rule of law' be put in the first place in the points of concern and not the last. Please support this more European position.The second oral amendment concerns the second part of the paragraph, on Russia as a democracy in an undefined future. As there are very sovereign concepts of what democracy means, it would be better to add something. Therefore, my oral amendment is to insert the following after the word 'democracy': 'and refuses military threats as a means of political pressure on its neighbours'.As we cannot support such policies, please support this amendment."

First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008. This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend. Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere. This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world.(Applause)Third, it is such an unbelievable aspersion, such an unbelievable discrimination against the Pope that the ALDE Group may well be identified with it, but under no circumstances should the European Parliament be.(Loud applause)\nPERSON119 : Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament, since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.\nPERSON120 : (FR) Mr President, I just wanted to say, on a legal note, to Mr Nassauer, that the Pope does not count the years, for he counts eternity.\nPERSON121 : Please, please ... The legal service has checked this carefully, from a technical perspective, from the perspective of the elements mentioned, from a content perspective and from the perspective of the period under examination.The legal service is of the opinion that the amendment is admissible, and this is also the opinion of the President of the European Parliament. It is therefore the opinion of Mr P\u00f6ttering only that shall prevail. Thus, I am sorry, Mr Nassauer, but the amendment is admissible.- Before the vote on paragraph 25\nPERSON122 : Mr President, I wish to refer strictly to an update of information, because the text was condemning the imprisonment of a Sudanese leader who has been released.\nPERSON124 : (DE) Mr President, Mr Nassauer, the right to self-determination is a human right and that includes sexual self-determination. To that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate.I will read Amendment 2 aloud. On the one hand, it is about a correction of fact and, on the other, a somewhat more balanced formulation:'Underlines the importance of promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS, which causes enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic development, affecting particularly the poorest regions in the world; is concerned about declarations made by Pope Benedict XVI, which create the impression that condom use could even lead to an increased risk of contagion; is of the opinion that those statements will severely hamper the fight against HIV/AIDS;'. The remainder of the amendment remains unchanged.(Applause from the left)\nPERSON126 : (DE) Mr President, the amendment is not as rude in tone as the prototype but the facts are unchanged. We therefore reject the oral amendment.(The oral amendment was not accepted)After the vote on Amendment 16\nPERSON128 : Mr President, forgive me for interrupting your chairing, but my understanding was that Amendment 16 was actually rejected, and yet you announced it was adopted. Could you just clarify the situation?\nPERSON129 : Yes, please excuse me, it was a slip of the tongue. Indeed, the majority was against. It was worth having it checked, but the services had already rectified my mistake.Thank you for your point."

"transcript": "PERSON088 : rapporteur. - Mr President, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women's empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda.Yet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU's external policies is still weak. For instance, only eight of the 27 Member States have adopted national action plans on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.Furthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the Council. In fact, there is not a single female EU special representative at the moment. For this reason, the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field. For instance, the Commission should speed up its work on an EU action plan on gender equality. I am convinced that this is key to strengthening the gender dimension in EU foreign policy.Let me conclude by saying that women's rights are part of the broader concept of human and civic rights. Without addressing gender equality and promoting women's rights in the EU's foreign policy, that policy cannot be effective.(Applause)"

Firstly, I should like us to make a technical correction to footnote 2 in paragraph 16; the last figure is '2021', not '2022'. It is a question of arithmetic.I would also like to say a few political words in order, firstly, to thank all those who have supported me in the drafting of this report - it may seem extremely technical to you, but it is eminently political. It is very important that our Parliament vote in favour of this report, because it clarifies the future budgetary powers of Parliament as a budgetary authority.Often, you vote on the budget as a management tool, when in fact it is the very essence of politics, and Parliament's role depends on its being implemented. That is what we wished to cover in this report; I hope that you will read it one day. May I say, however, that the new MEPs will have to grab hold of it and realise that making a European policy takes budgetary courage and that it is on this courage - which I hope they will all have and we will all have - that the future of the Union depends.(Applause)"

The fact that, to round off its work in this parliamentary term, this House has adopted five reports, all of which are connected with the Treaty of Lisbon, is an important signal for the European elections and for the time after that.This House has always worked continuously and consistently for the Reform Treaty, even in times of difficulty and when many had doubts and even wanted to abandon the project. Yesterday, with the 'yes' in the Czech Senate, we took a huge step forward. Congratulations to the country that has the Presidency.(Applause)We may now be justifiably optimistic that this reform project will enter into force at the end of 2009 with a positive vote in Ireland.The newly elected European Parliament will have many new powers and capabilities. This newly elected Chamber of Citizens in the European Union can fulfil the promise we have made to achieve a better EU with more democratic control and more transparency. I thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially today's rapporteurs and the overwhelming majority of Members in this House who supported all the reports and made this progress possible. Thank you very much.(Applause)\nPERSON092 : Our fellow Member, Hans-Peter Martin, has asked to take the floor; it really must be for a point of order.\nPERSON093 : (DE) Mr President, I have just one question. If the Irish say 'no' again, how often must they keep going to the polls? A third, fourth, fifth time? That is not democracy, it is a karaoke parliament.\nPERSON094 : It was not a point of order, but I had the good grace not to make a martyr of you.\nPERSON095 : Mr President, I want to make a personal statement in relation to what Mr Martin just said. The Irish Parliament is not a 'karaoke parliament', and I object to it being described as such by that man.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON094 : rapporteur. - Mr President, the oral amendment by Mr Landsbergis obliges me to explain the complicated situation concerning a name.'FYROM' has never been the name of any country but can only be an abbreviation of 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'. In my previous report, adopted by the plenary meeting of this Parliament on 12 July 2007, it was decided not to introduce the use of this abbreviation as a name but only to use those five words.The conclusion was to replace all other terms included in amendments by 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.I propose to maintain this line. The oral amendment proposed by Mr Landsbergis is not in line with this decision. I expect that during 2008 an agreement with Greece will solve the different views on the names of this state and that then the term FYROM will be forgotten forever.\nPERSON095 : Mr President, we are in a tricky situation with one of our neighbours when a normally existing republic on the European continent is officially called non-existent - only 'the \"former\u201d Republic of M.' - by decision of the UN.Before Washington follows New York and demands that the Georgia in the Caucasus should be called the 'former Soviet Republic of Georgia', we could express our dissatisfaction with such practices and work to find a solution for 'M.'. That is my interim proposal - not to replace the name of someone 'former', but to correct the situation with the text of our report by inserting an additional explanation: 'the country under the name of FYROM'.Please have a little sense of humour and support. We should help both Greece and 'M.'.(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"

That is thanks to the excellent work between the Parliament, Council and Commission and the work particularly of my shadows, Mrs Wallis and Mr Gauz\u00e8s of the PPE-DE Group, who took a very strong line with the Council and Commission.I think it has been over a year since we agreed this proposal but it is the mediation experts and professionals in this sector whose response to the Parliament's first ever online consultation convinced us of the merits of this law. I know that they will now welcome today's vote in bringing these proposals into legislation.Too often we see cases where a marriage or a relationship involving children goes wrong and constituents end up with years of court procedures and massive legal fees. One of my constituents with a Greek partner amassed legal bills and had to go through the court system for three years to get her children back. Mediation can therefore be a valuable tool for citizens to achieve access to justice and potentially reduce the cost of dispute resolution without the often acrimonious process of going to trial.It has the added benefit of freeing up court time for cases that require a court judgment. This new law should assist people across Europe in getting quick, affordable access to justice. I therefore urge Members to support the second reading and open up new avenues of redress and remedies for citizens across the EU.(Applause)\nPERSON084 : I would remind colleagues that in plenary the rapporteur is entitled to ask for the floor for two minutes, so could everyone please exercise the appropriate self-control. I believe however that Mr Rack has called for the floor on a point of order.\nPERSON085 : (DE) Mr President, normally, we would say that our machinery is not working, but in this particular case, it is the lifts which are not working. Very many of our colleagues are waiting to make their way down to the Chamber.

"transcript": "PERSON006 : Ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, a Polish engineer, Piotr Sta\u0144czak, who has been held as a hostage by terrorists in Pakistan since last September, was murdered by his captors. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my outrage at this abhorrent murder of an innocent man who was a Polish citizen and a citizen of the European Union. The European Parliament denounces this criminal act in the strongest possible terms. We would like to offer the family of the deceased and all his relatives our heartfelt sympathy and condolences.Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to attain one's ends through blind violence and to destroy our common values. It poses a great danger to the security and stability of the international community. Terrorism is a crime, and one which we cannot go soft on.Ladies and gentlemen, in the mother tongue of this murdered engineer, I would like to say, Niech spoczywa w wiecznym pokoju [May he rest in eternal peace].In memory of Piotr Sta\u0144czak, can I ask you all now to rise to commemorate him.(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)Ladies and gentlemen, the forest fires in Australia have led to a tragic loss of life over recent days. These, the worst bushfires in Australia's history, have claimed many lives in horrible circumstances. We were all horrified by the violent power of this natural disaster and its horrendous consequences. I have written to the Australian Prime Minister to convey the sincere sympathy of the European Parliament. On behalf of the European Parliament at today's plenary session, I would like, once again, to express our solidarity with Australia, its people and its authorities in these sad times.Next week, a delegation from this Parliament will travel to Australia in order to convey our condolences personally. I would like to take this opportunity, however, to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives. Our thoughts are with you.Ladies and gentlemen, worrying news is again emerging from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Seven leading figures in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religious community were taken into custody in May 2008. For eight months, they were denied the opportunity of legal counsel. Now, these seven dignitaries of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religious community are to be subjected to a trial this week that meets not even the most basic requirements of the rule of law. The Nobel prize-winner and Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who was prepared to handle the defence of the imprisoned leaders, has herself been on the receiving end of death threats.The European Parliament calls on the Iranian authorities once again, and in the most urgent terms, to respect human rights and the rights of religious minorities and to reconsider its indictment against the seven leaders of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed - Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saeid Rasaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli and Vahid Tizfahm. These people were incarcerated solely as a result of their beliefs and should be released immediately.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 13 February 2009, the Spanish Member of this House, Mr Herrero, was arrested by the Venezuelan Government in the capital, Caracas, and subsequently expelled from the country, as a result of comments he had made to the media about the Venezuelan Government. Mr Herrero was in the country as part of the official delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who had been invited by an opposition party in the context of the constitutional referendum. To arrest him, the police forced their way into his hotel room and they then put him on a scheduled flight to Brazil, without an official explanation or any opportunity to collect his personal belongings. We find this unacceptable!On behalf of the European Parliament, I protest to the strongest possible degree about these methods. I emphatically condemn this incident, which represents an infringement of human rights and a denigration of the democratic institution that is the European Parliament.(Applause)\nPERSON007 : Mr President, I rise as Chair of Parliament's Delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand to strongly identify myself with the statement you have just made and to thank you for it. I look forward to delivering that message next week in Australia.\nPERSON008 : Thank you very much, Mr Chichester."

"transcript": "PERSON070 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I would like to introduce a motion. In Parliament, we quite clearly agree on two points. On the one hand, we want to be involved in the procedure for these new technical variants and this cannot be decided without Parliament. I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani, who has ensured that this is the case.Secondly, it is clear to all of us that this new technical measure must be considered with a great deal of sensitivity. We have a number of concerns about it. The criteria for the possible application must be carefully controlled and everyone in the House agrees on this. I would like to move on behalf of the PPE-DE Group that we give ourselves an extra four weeks and postpone the vote until November, because Commissioner Tajani has stated that there will be a major hearing on the subject in November. The PPE-DE Group is of the opinion that we should hear all the facts before we come to a decision. I hope that we will have a majority in favour of this. This is why we are moving that the vote be adjourned until November.\nPERSON071 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to oppose this motion for the following reason. It is true that Mr Tajani's hearing will give us the opportunity to acquire additional information and to define our position. However, what we are doing with this decision is to tell the Council, which has already reached a resolution during the last Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs, that in our view, and this applies at least to my group, security and security measures are absolutely essential. However, the use of scanners or display devices which show people completely naked is totally unacceptable. This is a violation of human dignity and it is not accompanied by any increase in security.(Applause from the left and from the centre)This is the perfect example of the mania for security which is going on here. With our decision we want to send a clear signal that we are opposed to measures of this kind, which are also extremely controversial on medical grounds. We therefore ask you to reject Mr Weber's motion.(Applause)\nPERSON072 : Thank you very much. The ALDE group has requested a roll-call vote on this motion.(Parliament rejected the motion to adjourn the vote)"

"transcript": "PERSON044 : Ladies and gentlemen, Twenty years ago in 1988, the European Parliament instituted the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which has been awarded every year since then.Over the course of the last twenty years, we have honoured outstanding organisations or figures who have dedicated their lives to defending human rights and fundamental freedoms and who have fought against intolerance, fanaticism and oppression in their own countries and throughout the world. The first person to be awarded the prize was Nelson Mandela, whom I will be meeting next week in Johannesburg as part of an invitation to speak before the Pan-African Parliament.This year the Conference of Presidents has decided to award the Sakharov Prize 2008 to Hu Jia 'on behalf of the silenced voices of China and Tibet' as it states in the proposal for a decision from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.(Applause)Hu Jia was born on 25 July 1973 in Beijing and is one of the most passionate defenders of human rights in the People's Republic of China. This dedicated activist is subject to accusations because of his commitment to the environment, his fight against the dangers of HIV and AIDS and his efforts to ensure that human rights are respected.On 27 December 2007, Hu Jia was placed under house arrest on charges of inciting subversion. On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.In his solitary prison cell, Hu Jia is now fighting his illness. He suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, but as far as we know he is being denied regular medical care.The arbitrary arrest and conviction of Hu Jia has caused outrage throughout the world. By awarding the Sakharov prize to Hu Jia, the European Parliament is demonstrating forcefully and with determination its recognition of the daily fight for freedom carried on by all defenders of human rights in China.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, I have another brief statement to make. Tomorrow, on 24 October, we will be celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the United Nations. On this occasion, I would like to highlight the extent, the commitment and the success of the collaboration between the European Union, the European Parliament and the various programmes and institutions of the United Nations.Not long ago a publication entitled 'Improving Lives', of which you have all received a copy, presented a summary of the collaboration over the years. In recent weeks, we have seen the start of a difficult period throughout the world, in particular in relation to the financial crisis and its drastic effects on the world economy.In this context in particular, the European Union's fundamental values of multilateral understanding and solidarity are of great importance. This also applies to our commitment to and responsibility for the developing countries. The international conference on development financing which will be held in November will also play a decisive role in this respect. Despite the fact that we are faced with considerable challenges, we must not lose sight of the interests of the developing countries."

"transcript": "PERSON102 : (ES) Mr President, I have a small proposal for you and for all presidents who chair votes. We have many roll-call votes, and I do not think that the Rules of Procedure require the President to read the figures. Everyone can read the screen. It is sufficient for you to say 'adopted' or 'rejected'.If you could agree to this, we would save time.\nPERSON103 : If everyone agrees, so does the President.- Before the vote on paragraph 65:\nPERSON104 : rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, there has actually been an error with the numbers, and what we are going to vote on first, by means of a separate vote, is paragraph 65, except for indent 4, and we will then have a roll-call vote on indent 4. There has been a change of numbers, it is that simple.\nPERSON105 : That is right, Mr Pom\u00e9s, therefore let us proceed with the vote on paragraph 65, except for indent 4.- Before the vote on Amendment 9:\nPERSON106 : (SV) Mr President, under paragraph 65 we had no vote on indent 5. We voted separately on number four, but not on number five.\nPERSON107 : Mr Andersson, there are different language versions, and what we have voted on, what you are alluding to, was already included.So that there are no doubts, we are now going to vote solely on what Mr Andersson was saying, that is 'no relatives of Members be employed'.- Before the vote on paragraph 72:\nPERSON108 : (DE) Mr President, even if it is too late to say so, I think that the Member's objection may have been misunderstood. He wanted a vote on Paragraph 65, fifth indent. You had a vote on whether family members may be employed. Paragraph 65, fifth indent does not regulate that, but whether payments can be suspended in the event that there is suspicion of malpractice. We did not vote on that, or you announced something incorrectly. Just so that we clear that up, so that everyone knows what is happening.\nPERSON109 : Mr Alvaro, the problem is that, in the different language versions, this phrase was structured in a different way. This is what has created problems. We have therefore voted saying exactly what we were voting for, so that there are no doubts. Do you understand, Mr Alvaro?\nPERSON110 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to point out that those who prepared the voting lists were aware of the problem, so that the marks that you have in the voting list already take into account the different linguistic problems. That is to say, it was totally clear how the groups were voting. It is not the case that nobody knew what was being voted upon. We tried to correct this in the Tabling Office, and it was corrected.\nPERSON111 : In any case the vote was clear, so there is no problem at all."

"transcript": "PERSON138 : (DE) Mr President, I have no comments on the minutes of yesterday's session, but instead I would like to comment on an incident in this morning's session. My colleague, Kinga G\u00f6ncz, a Member of Parliament in my group and former Hungarian Foreign Minister, was insulted in the debate this morning by Krisztina Morvai from the fascist Jobbik party in a completely unacceptable way. As Foreign Minister for Hungary, Mrs G\u00f6ncz has worked harder than almost anyone else in the country to achieve international reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbouring countries. I would like to reject emphatically the outrageous insult made to Mrs G\u00f6ncz by Mrs Morvai, a member of a neo-fascist party.(Applause)\nPERSON139 : (HU) Thank you for this opportunity to speak. I am very sorry that this discussion is being held here in the European Parliament. I would also like to respond briefly by saying that the party represented by Krisztina Morvai set up a paramilitary unit in 2006 and, since then, is using it to intimidate the peaceful public majority.This includes, in particular, minorities, gays, Roma and Jews. This paramilitary unit was recently disbanded by the courts, but an MEP from this party wore the uniform of this organisation in this chamber during the July session. In Hungary, this party conducted a campaign full of anti-European, racist, homophobic, anti-Roma and xenophobic diatribes and regularly described Hungary as a colony of the European Union in its utterances. The event which Krisztina Morvai spoke about took place in 2006 when these extreme right-wing protesters set the Hungarian television broadcasting corporation's central building on fire and ran riot for days, resulting in 113 police officers being injured.They ran riot again on 23 October. They tried, in fact, to disrupt a national ceremony using violence. This was the first time in the country's history, since the change of regime, that the police had had any experience of dealing with extreme right-wing protests. After this, the government set up an independent committee, whose reports are available on a wide range of websites, including in English. This committee made suggestions and numerous court proceedings were also initiated. Hungarian government bodies investigated these abuses.There were indeed problems. However, I would like to say to Krisztina Morvai that if she is calling the institutional system in her own country dictatorial, the problem with this is that if democracy was not really working in Hungary, she would not have been able to make her speech in this Chamber just now. I apologise again that this subject was raised before Parliament and I sincerely hope that this discussion will not be continued here.\nPERSON140 : (HU) Mr President, according to the Rules of Procedure, I have half a minute to ask a question. This question is addressed to Mr Schulz. Based on the slanderous statements made here by his colleague, how can he dare call a party fascist in this Chamber, simply because it does not agree with every aspect of the European Union's main thrust? This party received 430 000 votes in Hungary. You are therefore calling 430 000 voters fascist. From now on, think before you speak!"

"transcript": "PERSON020 : The final draft agenda drawn up on Thursday 10 September 2009 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.Monday and TuesdayNo changes.\nPERSON021 : (FR) Mr President, I shall be extremely brief.I should like in fact to invoke the Rules of Procedure relating to the Conference of Presidents which, as you pointed out, Mr President, sets the agenda.Our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Conference of Presidents shall consist of yourself, obviously, of the group chairmen, and also of a representative of the non-attached Members.To date, the representative of the non-attached Members has still not been appointed. A number of non-attached Members have written to you on this issue and are more than willing to meet with you.It would be good, Mr President, if you could convene a meeting of all the non-attached Members so that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, they can elect their delegate to the Conference of Presidents and the Conference can take its decisions with a full complement of members.\nPERSON022 : Thank you for your comment. I shall contact you and other Members during this sitting in order to make the necessary arrangements.WednesdayI have received a motion by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for Wednesday.\nPERSON023 : Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has voted to place the election - the appointment - of the President of the Commission on Wednesday's agenda.On Tuesday afternoon we will hold a debate on the President of the Commission's proposals. We propose postponing the vote on his appointment, for the simple reason that the referendum in Ireland is due to be held in 22 days' time. This referendum is crucial to the acceptance, or rejection, of the Treaty of Lisbon. An opinion poll published today tells us that 62% of Irish people are ready to vote in favour.I believe that we must respect the people of Ireland's vote, whether we are for or against the Treaty of Lisbon. However, it seems absurd to us, for the sake of 21 days, to bring forward a vote and appoint a president under the Treaty of Nice, when we - at least, those who are for the Treaty of Lisbon - have the possibility of having a Commission and its President appointed under the Treaty of Lisbon.In October, we will know what we are bound by. The Polish President has solemnly declared that he will sign the Treaty of Lisbon after the Irish referendum.The Czech Constitutional Court has solemnly declared that it will speed up decision making on the two complaints against the Treaty of Lisbon since, last time, it was unanimous in saying that the Treaty of Lisbon was constitutional.There is therefore no option for the Czech President to say 'No' once the Treaty has been ratified in Poland and Ireland.I have nearly finished, but this is very important, Mr President. It is Parliament's identity that is at stake on this issue, and if we do not have two minutes to reflect on it then we have not done our job as MEPs. That is an important point. That is why I am asking you not to vote for or against Mr Barroso, but to vote after the people of Ireland and to postpone the vote today and to vote next month if necessary.\nPERSON024 : Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit discussed a motion put forward by my group in the Conference of Presidents last week. We put forward the motion in question as we believe that it is not really the issue of the Irish referendum, nor the issue of the Constitutional Court in Prague, but the issue of the lack of cohesion in the opinions of the Council that is responsible for the confusion currently prevalent. It is abundantly clear that a community based on law - and the European Union claims to be just that - must act in accordance with applicable law. The applicable law is the Treaty of Nice. There is therefore no alternative to working with the Treaty of Nice, and that means working with the President of the Commission and all the Commissioners.The Council wants to elect the President on the basis of the Treaty of Nice but to then do what Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, namely to apply the Treaty of Lisbon to Commissioners, which would mean that we would have a President of the Commission elected on a different legal basis than his Commissioners - which, by the way, is something the President of the Commission himself thinks is very regrettable. That is why he is going around talking of the Lisbon majority that he needs but will not get.That, on its own, shows the confusion that the Council has given rise to, something that is in no way beneficial to the EU or to the President of the Commission himself. For this reason, we were of the opinion that the vote should be delayed until the Council has managed to agree what it wants. We therefore support this ...(The President cut off the speaker)We believe that this postponement is necessary for reasons that differ little from those enunciated by Mr Cohn-Bendit, and for the reasons we have mentioned, we support the motion.\nPERSON025 : I should now like a Member to speak against the motion. Mr Daul has asked for the floor. You have the floor, Mr Daul.\nPERSON026 : Mr President, I always keep to my speaking time, as you know.Firstly, I do not understand Mr Cohn-Bendit: he should have already asked for the election of the European Parliament to be postponed until such time as we had the Treaty of Lisbon.Since, today, we have the Treaty of Nice in the European Parliament, we call for that Treaty to be applied until the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force. I would also ask that, until we are able to vote again on Mr Barroso, we abide by the rules to the very end. Parliament must be ready to function under the Treaty of Lisbon and, then, we will be able to vote on Mr Barroso and the Treaty of Lisbon, Mr Cohn-Bendit. Otherwise, we will not be consistent. That is what I wished to say to you.In order to have a Commission - and I am going to request this tomorrow - I would ask that, after the referendum of 2 October, we put in place a Commission on the basis of the Treaty that exists, that is, Nice. We will debate the Treaty of Lisbon when the time comes, when Mr Cohn-Bendit has convinced Mr Klaus to sign - and as he is willing to do so, he will do so very quickly. We will place Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon, and then we will elect our President of the Commission under the Treaty of Lisbon, because, if we want to be consistent, we have to be so from start to finish. What we need now is a Commission that functions in the recession, a Commission that functions under Copenhagen. However, as you know, there is still a long way to go before all of the commissioners and the Commission are up and running.That is why I, together with my equally competent group members, ask that we vote on Wednesday for the President of the Commission.(Applause)"

This is yet another occasion to demand their immediate release on humanitarian grounds.(Applause)Since the state of health of many of the kidnap victims, including Mrs Betancourt herself, gives extreme cause for concern, we demand their immediate release on humanitarian grounds and the dispatch of an international medical team to provide the hostages with rapid medical assistance.

"transcript": "PERSON250 : The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the European Code of Conduct for Arms Exports.\nPERSON251 : President-in-Office. - (SL) Firstly, on behalf of the Council I would like to express satisfaction with the traditionally good relations and cooperation between the Council's Conventional Arms Exports Working Group, COARM, and the European Parliament, more precisely with its Subcommittee on Security and Defence, SEDE. I am convinced that this well-organised and excellent cooperation will continue into the future, which is why I welcome today's debate.Allow me to say a few words about the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. As we know, the code was adopted in 1998. It gave the European Union new impetus in monitoring the arms trade. In accordance with this code, the Union started making annual reports that are actually reports on completed arms transfers.This year we will make a tenth annual report. I should also mention that these reports have become increasingly clear and informative. Because of this code, in the last few years most Member States have started to publish their national annual reports on the export of arms and military equipment. In 2003 the European Union defined its own list of arms and military equipment to be covered by the code and started more serious coordination of the policy for export to individual third countries. The Member States also exchange information concerning rejected and completed arms exports.This dynamism has been transferred to international organisations, especially those in which Member States of the European Union play an important part. This applies especially to the Wassenaar Arrangement. The code was improved in 2006 and 2007, specifically with additions to the users' manual.As we know, the code is not a legally binding document. However, the Member States have a political commitment to abide by its provisions. There have been attempts in the past to build on the code by adding a common position that would be a legally binding document by which the Member States would have to abide when exporting arms. However, there is still no agreement on adopting such a common position. The Slovenian Presidency is working for its adoption during the Slovenian period of office, that is to say in the first half of this year, or at least working to achieve substantial progress in this direction.Maybe there is no better opportunity for this progress than that offered by the preparation of the European Union's tenth report on the implementation of the code. However, at the moment we cannot confidently predict whether our wish will be fulfilled. Of course, this is not stopping us from trying. We will therefore call on all Member States to give us their opinions on this issue and we will try to encourage them to work together on reaching a common position. If there are no impediments, the Slovenian Presidency will take great pleasure in completing the adoption procedure and will submit a report to all interested institutions, primarily to Parliament.Allow me to say a few brief words on two other priority topics: the common position on the brokering of arms and military equipment trading, and the efforts made by the Member States to adopt internationally binding agreements on arms trading.The European Union adopted guidelines for the brokering of arms trading in 2001, and the common position was adopted in 2003. By adopting this position, the Member States took upon themselves an obligation to adopt its elements into their national legislation and thereby regulate the brokering of arms and military equipment trading. At the moment 20 Member States have adopted the elements of this common position into their national legislation, and seven have yet to complete the process. The Presidency will follow progress in this matter, and the States which have not completed the process will be encouraged to do so as soon as possible.Now to the last item: the international arms trade agreement. This is one of the key projects in disarmament. As you know, the European Council has recently adopted a decision to support the international agreement. The framework for the composition of the group of government experts working in this field was confirmed at last year's General Assembly. Information about the initial work of this group is encouraging; nevertheless, a lot of effort and work will have to be invested in this process.Within our activities, we will closely follow the work of this group and support the process leading to the international agreement.\nPERSON252 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I took a little more time on Iraq but I shall be a bit briefer now, so I will try to make good on my time.Even if the responsibility for controlling and monitoring the sale of arms rests primarily with Member States and thus with the Council, the Commission also has a clear interest through its contribution to the implementation of the EU small arms and light weapons strategy under the common foreign and security policy.We greatly value the effective control and monitoring of EU arms exports. We remain concerned that European controls should encourage other regions to adopt and apply - at the very least - minimum standards, in order to ensure that legitimate exports are not subsequently diverted, thereby exacerbating armed conflicts and human rights violations.In this connection, the Commission continues to engage actively with Member States, third countries, international organisations and others in order to deal with the financing of illicit arms trafficking, often linked with illicit trade in other commodities (particularly drugs), for example diamonds.We in the Commission took advantage of our chairmanship of the Kimberley Process last year to push for the development of controls to prevent and deter the use of diamonds to fund arms purchases by rebel groups. Further, in close collaboration with the relevant customs authorities, we intend to take forward measures under the new Instrument for Stability to combat illegal trafficking in arms by air, targeting particularly aircraft travelling to and within Africa. We also play a role in the implementation of arms embargoes by prohibiting related technical assistance.Within the European Union, control of firearms trafficking is crucial in the fight against insecurity and criminality, especially against organised crime. The policy being developed to combat firearms trafficking involves the reinforcement of controls on the legal sale and holding of firearms within the Union. This goes on to encompass the proper monitoring of the movement of firearms within the Union and the development of cooperation between national administrations in charge.Besides these efforts, we can see that a significant quantity of firearms is also in the possession of criminals and available on the black market. The unauthorised transfer of firearms across borders, and the transfer of unmarked firearms, are therefore important sources of these illegal weapons. Steps are currently being taken at European level to enhance rules on record keeping and marking, to develop an export/import system for firearms for civilian use, and to improve cooperation between national law enforcement administrations.Improving the traceability of firearms is a key objective, and externally - very briefly - we are also taking concrete steps outside the Union to handle the problems arising from explosive remnants of war and small arms in crisis regions, again under the Stability Instruments. For instance, in Bosnia we are currently considering supporting a project to deal with unexploded ordnance and other explosive remnants.Certainly we will continue to support Member States' efforts to establish a treaty covering the arms trade, as our Council President has said, although we might not be under the illusion that this will not take a certain time. But hopefully it will happen very soon.\nPERSON253 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, for nearly 10 years the European Council has dragged its feet on transforming the EU code of conduct on arms transfer into a legally binding document. For the last two years there have been no technical barriers to adopting a common position on the code. Why do we finally have to get our house in order?Firstly, there are currently estimated to be some 400 companies in our Member States producing arms. Given that research and development costs in this industry are extremely high, companies naturally wish to maximise their profits by ensuring the longest possible production runs, selling licensing agreements and, in short, seeking markets wherever they can. Companies from the 20 nations whose governments imposed strict guidelines on arms exports are clearly at an economic disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors whose governments show more leniency. All companies should have a level playing field.Secondly, we have documented instances of companies from EU states supplying arms to China, Colombia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. How can we on the one hand applaud all efforts to promote economic development, democracy and human rights while we make the very implementation of this impossible by contributing to violent conflicts?Thirdly, we deploy military personnel from our Member States on EU and NATO peacekeeping missions but, by failing to apply this code of conduct, we risk that they may come under fire from weapons produced within our very states as a result of irresponsible transfer.Fourthly, how can we envisage a future Europe with a common foreign and security policy when we lack such a fundamental element in the form of a common position?Finally, before we stand up in this Chamber championing human rights and democracy, let us ensure that we also take action that gives substance to our rhetoric.The PPE-DE Group congratulates the authors of this motion for a resolution. We trust that the overwhelming support from Parliament will help the Council in finding a way out of the current political impasse and finally make adherence to the code of conduct a legal requirement for all Member States.\nPERSON254 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) The motion for a resolution on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports expresses Parliament's frustration at the current deadlock on this important instrument, as our rapporteur, Mrs Gacek, has just said and whom I must congratulate.Ten years after its establishment, the Code is still a source of pride to those who believe that the European Union must take the lead in the global debate on controlling arms transfers. We welcome the increasingly harmonised application of the Code, the detail in the annual reports presented by Member States and the outreach initiatives undertaken by the Council. However, all these advances pale into insignificance beside the most important issue: the need to transform the Code into a legally binding instrument.We know that transforming the Code of Conduct into a common position of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) has been linked with lifting the embargo on arms exports to China. Parliament rejects the blackmail that is at the root of this three-year deadlock. No one can be unaware that the arms sold by Beijing to the Sudanese regime are feeding the conflict in Darfur and are also serving, for example, to oppress and repress the Burmese people at the hands of the illegitimate military regime. This situation frustrates Parliament because we have long known the practical and theoretical reasons which should be sufficient to rid the Council of its hesitations. A European foreign policy without common and binding rules on arms exports will always be incomplete and ineffective. In addition, one of the most significant obstacles to the full harmonisation of the internal market in defence equipment is precisely the large number of export rules in the EU.Finally, there is a question of principle: the European Union can only present itself as a responsible and coherent international actor in this area and can only lead the work to improve international legislation if it is seen as a model to be followed. We are clearly counting on the Slovenian Presidency and Minister Lenar\u010di\u010d. However, we have already indicated to the next country to hold the presidency, France, a country that has particular responsibility for this continuing deadlock, that the time has come to resolve the issues and recognise the importance of placing the European Union at the forefront of effective and responsible multilateralism.\nPERSON997 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is 10 years since the EU agreed a code of conduct for arms exports and it is shameful that this code has not yet been transformed into an effective instrument for controlling arms exports by all EU companies and governments. As a result, European arms are still being channelled into conflict zones.The EU finds itself in the incomprehensible position of supplying arms and fuelling conflicts in the very countries in which it is simultaneously pouring development aid. How do we explain that to our citizens? How do we explain, for example, that some Member States are still prepared to trade cluster munitions while, at the same time, the EU is spending millions of euros on mine clearance? For example, in 2005 thousands of cluster bombs were used in Lebanon with devastating results, and then in 2006 the EU spent EUR 525 million on development aid to Lebanon, partly for the removal of unexploded ordnance.Let us not kid ourselves that it is only countries outside the EU that are supplying arms to conflict states: 7 out of 10 of the world's top arms-exporting countries are EU Member States. Is it not time that we invested in conflict resolution for troubled states instead of arms sales?Mechanisms are urgently needed to control arms transfers and transhipments properly and to prevent the brokering of illegal arms by EU companies located outside the EU. But the first step must be to turn the 1998 code of conduct into a legally binding instrument. So I would beg the Slovenian Presidency to do its utmost to unblock the stalemate in the Council and get the common position adopted.\nPERSON255 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, as rapporteur for the control of arms exports from the European Union, I have had the opportunity to follow very closely the process of transforming the current Code of Conduct into a more efficient and effective instrument that ensures greater and better controls of arms exports from EU territory and by EU companies.Nonetheless, in spite of the technical work done some time ago by the Council Working Group on Arms (COARM), we still do not understand - and my colleagues have said the same - why the Council is resisting adopting the common position that would enable us to transform the current Code into a legally binding instrument.In spite of the excessive secrecy surrounding debates of this kind, we know that only a few countries are opposed to such a step, notably France, which, it seems, is making this decision dependent on an end to the embargo on exporting arms to China.We must stress once again that these are two completely separate issues: linking them in this way shows a huge lack of responsibility in relation to the numerous victims who have to cope every day with the consequences of our irresponsible arms exports policy.I therefore welcome the commitment of the Slovenian Presidency to conclude this process of transforming the Code into a common position during its mandate, although I recall, too, that previous presidencies made the same promise to no avail. I hope that you will succeed and you can count on our full support. I would point out, too, that it is precisely the lack of control and current laxness that allow, both legally and illegally, European weapons to end up in the hands of terrorist groups, dictators and armed factions, who mortgage the present and the future of millions of people, to whom, as needed but not without a certain cynicism, we subsequently send our development aid teams.\nPERSON256 : on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, we all sit here at least once a year and discuss the issue of arms exports, while the rest of the time these exports carry on quite happily. For years Parliament has been calling for a legally binding code of conduct and the Council has been unable to reach any agreement on the matter. I would appreciate it if you could tell us quite frankly which of the Member States is obstructing this process. The fact that this Code of Conduct is not legally binding is a disgrace. While this has dragged on, the EU and its Member States have become the world's number one arms exporter. Weapons are designed to kill! All arms exports are wrong.Naturally, the Member States supply arms to crisis and conflict regions as well. The Turkish invasion of northern Iraq, for example, which violated international law, was carried out with weapons from Germany, among others. EU countries also wage wars, notably in Iraq or Afghanistan, and supply weapons to friendly countries that are engaged in warfare. We have to put a stop to this once and for all. Let us stop all arms exports.Dual-use goods that have civilian and military applications must also come under the Code of Conduct, as must re-exports. We have tabled amendments on both these topics for tomorrow's debate, and I am very keen to see whether they will be adopted by Parliament. As I have said, arms exports kill people every day, and they must be stopped as a matter of urgency.\nPERSON257 : President-in-Office. - (SL) I have understood that the common mood of the participants in this debate is support for the code to become legally binding as soon as possible. I should add that the Presidency shares this objective and I hope, Mr Pfl\u00fcger, that this year we will have more luck and succeed in achieving it or at least, as I said in the introduction, make major progress in this direction.I would like to thank you for your support of the Council's endeavours to reach a common position, and you can trust that the Slovenian Presidency will strengthen its efforts to this end.I would like to thank Mrs Gomes, who pointed out that there is an attempt to include new players in the implementation of the code, namely those outside the European Union borders. The previous Presidencies, for example in 2007, included countries of the western Balkans, in particular, in these activities. There are also activities relating to other countries, such as Turkey, Ukraine, north African countries and some other eastern European countries.I will end by expressing my hope that, in the next debate of this topic in the European Parliament, the discussion will not be just about the code, but also about the common position.\nPERSON258 : I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.Written Statements (Rule 142)\nPERSON259 : in writing. - I strongly call on EU Member States to adopt the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers. The EU is based on common values and agreements, condemning illegal arms transfer and also arms transfer to countries which violate those values. In fact, it is detrimental to the principles on which the European Community is based that several Member States' governments give preference to their national political and commercial interests in continuing to sell arms.The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the role of the EU as global player. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that we take the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers seriously in order to implement it in real terms and by all Member States. Therefore, I would like to call upon the Council to give a plausible explanation why the adoption of this Common Position has been delayed."

"transcript": "PERSON231 : The next item is the report by Tanja Fajon, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0112/2009 -.\nPERSON232 : Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barrot, and all of you attending here today, the European Parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans. That is also the core idea that has guided us throughout the preparation of the report. I would like to express my compliments, in particular, to the shadow rapporteurs and members of Parliament, as without their support I would not have been able to achieve this result. Likewise, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their collaborative efforts which will form the firm bedrock of future cooperation in this area, especially once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified, as that will enable Parliament to adopt any necessary measures through the codecision procedure.The citizens of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long. They have fewer rights today, as regards free travel, than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia. What young people from the countries of the Western Balkans know about Europe, or America for that matter, today is what they learn from the internet and television. As I come from Slovenia, I can recall that it was actually the Slovene Presidency which initiated the process of visa regime liberalisation in early 2008, five years after the signing of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which guarantees an unambiguous European perspective for the population of the Western Balkans.I am pleased to welcome the Commission's proposal for the abolition of the visa requirement for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and I am particularly pleased to welcome Slovenia's initiative, which has received strong support from the Member States and which allows the citizens of these countries to start travelling freely to the countries of the Schengen area from 19 December. 1 January 2010 would have entailed logistical difficulties, as the Christmas and New Year holiday period is exactly the time when many citizens of these countries want to travel to visit their relations living in the Member States.The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions and will also help to build cultural, social, economic and political bridges.Ladies and gentlemen, the abolition of visas for the three countries I have mentioned is a very positive step in the right direction. However, I should point out that the countries which were omitted from the visa abolition framework should be allowed to join it as soon as possible or, rather, as soon as they are ready to do so. Naturally, I am talking about Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. We cannot allow them to become ever more isolated, at a time when their neighbouring countries are enjoying the possibility of unlimited travel into the European Union.Of course, they need to be prepared for visa abolition and I do not mean to suggest here that we need to lower our criteria. What we want to do is to send a clear message to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania: We are waiting for you; you must urge your governments to fulfil their side of the bargain. We, on the other hand, will do everything in our power to ensure that there are no delays in decision making on the European Union's side. I can safely say that this approach has met with the broad support of two committees, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which is my parent committee.I would also add that, tomorrow after the vote, I will ask for the floor in order to deliver a special political statement, a common statement of Parliament and the Council, which strongly supports the abolition of the visa requirement for all the countries of the Western Balkans. In this statement, on which we shall vote separately tomorrow, we will both welcome 19 December, the date when the visa requirement will be abolished for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and call on the European Commission to prepare, as soon as possible, a proposal that the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be abolished as soon as they have met the relevant criteria. We, on the other hand, undertake to deal with this proposal under an expedited procedure. I would like us to set a clear date for the abolition of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, although I am aware of the demanding nature of the procedures involved. I hope that the summer of 2010 will prove to be a realistic date for the abolition of the visa requirement for these two countries.Just to conclude. We should not forget Kosovo, either, if we do not want it to become a black hole on the map ...(The President cut off the speaker)Let me just conclude: The European Union has a political responsibility to finalise the process of visa liberalisation and tomorrow, I expect Parliament's broad support in this regard.\nPERSON233 : Madam President, it is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency could not be represented here tonight in the person of a Minister, as it would very much have liked.I understand that the Council Presidency was not invited and was told there was no need for it to be here. I would like to remind the House that the Swedish Presidency has driven and supported the process of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans from the very beginning.We should - and I know my colleague Tanja Fajon, the rapporteur, agrees with me - have a chance to thank the Council Presidency, for we owe it the joint declaration between Parliament and the Council, supported by the Commission, which is unique in the history of this institution.I would like an explanation, though maybe not here and now, of why the Council Presidency could not attend, and I would like it to go on the record that the Minister could not be here because no invitation was made.\nPERSON234 : I have been informed that the Council Presidency was invited, but it had scheduling problems and so is unable to be here. However, I will look into the matter.\nPERSON235 : Madam President, I wish to reply to the question put by Mrs Corazza Bildt and to say that the Swedish Presidency has indeed been very active in this process which, as Mrs Fajon has just ably explained, enables us to offer a number of citizens from the Member States concerned, and young people in particular, the possibility of engaging and interacting more with this Europe, which they are, at times, rather unfamiliar with.It is true that this proposal represents an historic stage in the development of European short-stay visa policy within the context of our relations with the countries of the Western Balkans. Moreover, the Commission welcomes the adoption of this legislative proposal by both the European Parliament and the Council. Everyone is aware of its major political impact and of the sensitive nature of the issue, which affects all of the citizens of the countries concerned.I understand Parliament's position. I would like, in this connection, to confirm the Commission's strong commitment to monitor closely the fulfilment, by all of the countries concerned, of all the criteria laid down in the road map. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had already been the subject of a positive assessment; the dialogue was therefore concluded with that country. In October, Serbia and Montenegro hosted missions led by the Commission, in association with the experts from the Member States, and those missions confirmed that all of the criteria of the respective road maps had been fulfilled properly.We are going to follow the same method for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the very significant progress made over the last few months, Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the necessary reforms requested in the road map to justify the exemption of the visa requirement. However, as you just said, Mrs Fajon, it is already very encouraging for them to hear that their neighbours already have this option of being exempted from the visa requirement, and I can confirm to you that I personally will do everything in my power to ensure that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can obtain this visa exemption as quickly as possible, as you want.I invite Parliament, which, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, will be a colegislator in the field of visas, to support the structured method of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas, which is the method followed by the Commission, because a different approach would cause confusion without really changing the visa regime. It would create false hopes and would be liable to slow down the efforts made by the countries in question to implement the reforms required by the road maps.At this stage, we are keeping Albania and Bosnia in Annex I to the regulation, while reaffirming the European Union's commitment to help these two countries meet the criteria in their road map, and thus to be exempted from the visa requirement in accordance with the procedures in force.In this context the Commission supports the text of the joint political declaration, which confirms this strong commitment by the Union to implement as quickly as possible the second stage of this visa liberalisation process for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia, Mrs Fajon.There you have it, Madam President. I believe that this is a very important point that shows the Balkan States just how attentive Europe is to their expectations and desires.\nPERSON236 : rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, the commitment supported in the Fajon report and backed by the proposed Council and Parliament declaration is a far-sighted one. It is to give visa-free travel to all the people of the Western Balkans. This is not solely a generous and altruistic move. It is also hard-headed and shrewd, since security in the widest sense of the word will be promoted and advanced. People who are free, and free to travel, tend to be committed to peaceful solutions and less prey to introverted nationalism which is a security threat.Who can fail to be moved by the images on the screens outside this Chamber and all the celebrations we have had this week marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall? While these obstacles cannot be compared to the Wall, they are still a barrier to the free communication and wider horizons that promote understanding and tolerance. Our insistence on an inclusive approach should include a fair result by the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement.I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for her hard work and the way that she has included all the nuances in every twist and turn of her deliberations over the last two months.I do also thank the Council, and especially the Swedish Presidency, for their work in helping us to get agreement on the declaration, which confirms the definite aim of visa liberalisation for all the citizens of the Western Balkans as soon as possible - and we hope that this will be during 2010, because the absence of a reasonable commonality in the target dates for achieving this free travel is divisive and creates instability.We also have made a commitment, in the Fajon report, to working for a visa facilitation and visa liberalisation road map for Kosovo similar to those for the other Western Balkan countries.I would also like to add the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom - which is not included in the present decision of the EU Schengen zone by virtue, of course, of not being a member - will also shortly follow the same path. I always feel a certain schizophrenia when working on these matters on the Schengen projects because I am a British MEP, but it obviously would be a good thing both for the European Union and for the Western Balkan region if the UK were to follow suit as quickly as possible.I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fajon, the rapporteur.\nPERSON237 : on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the PPE Group is committed to speeding up visa liberalisation for all countries in the Western Balkans by July 2010. We welcome and support the proposal to grant visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia by Christmas this year.We understand the plea of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania - a young generation which has been locked in and left out and feels imprisoned. To them we say: 'We are on your side; we are ready when you are ready'. It is regrettable that the slow start by the authorities in Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina left them behind. The responsibility for any delays rests with them. We exhort them to meet the benchmarks as soon as possible. We know that the Commission is helping in that process.Unfortunately, I have to say that I am saddened that it took us three months of negotiations for the PPE Group to convince the political Left in this House to operate according to the treaties. Is that so complicated? Finally, it too has understood that the European Parliament is not above the law.With all respect to my distinguished colleagues, I have to denounce a non-constructive attitude. There are no short cuts. There is no abracadabra. We are not here to score points. We are here to obtain results for the citizens of the Balkans. Let me be clear, any provisional mixed intermediary status does not accelerate the process and does not put pressure on the Commission or the Council. It definitely does not send any strong political message.I would like to conclude by saying that I experienced the siege of Sarajevo and the shelling for a year and a half. To my friends there, I am saying that I am committed.(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON238 : on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, until 2008 and the Slovenian Presidency, not enough progress was made on what the Commissioner rightly called an historic move towards visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans.As Mrs Ludford said, very correctly, there are deep practical considerations as to why this is important for us and why this is not just a reactive measure. So, on behalf of the Socialist and Democrat Group, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for the careful and painstaking work she has undertaken to move the European Union towards this ultimate goal of abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans. This has been done with the shadow rapporteurs and with the Commission and Council, and it should be commended.While it is clear that many see visa liberalisation as having great benefits on both sides; it is also the case that we have to take the whole House with us on the question of the road map and of ensuring that fundamental reforms are carried out in all of these countries in order to gain confidence for a truly decent visa liberalisation regime.The task for our rapporteur was to make a breakthrough on visa liberalisation while taking the House with her. She has done this in the form of the declaration that she negotiated with the Council. The declaration looks to visa liberalisation for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, to an acceleration of the liberalisation regime for Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to a sensitive compromise on the question of Kosovo.For all these reasons, my group supports this report and hopes it will gain widespread support in the House.\nPERSON239 : Madam President, I would first like to join with the previous speaker in expressing my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Mrs Fajon and Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also to the shadow rapporteurs. We have succeeded in presenting a proposal demanding that the Commission and the Council come up with an overall package for all the people of the entire Western Balkans, leaving no one out. I very much hope - and I am addressing Commissioner Barrot in this regard - that you can convince the Council that the goal of visa liberalisation should also apply to Kosovo, so the dialogue will now begin, and so that visa liberalisation will also be achieved for Bosnia and Albania by no later than the middle of next year. I would prefer it to be sooner.I would like to make one thing clear. Of course, it is a matter of implementation, but I have heard that everything has not yet been implemented in Serbia. I would like to know what you think about this. It is important to implement everything. I would like to thank everyone involved and I hope that all of the people ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON240 : (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, my fellow countrymen from East Germany obtained the freedom to travel. A few years later, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 arbitrarily jeopardised and then took away the freedom of travel for Serbs and then for all other countries in the region. How often since 2000 have we in this House, in declarations and in public debates, wished for the freedom of travel - visa-free travel - for the countries of South-Eastern Europe. We know that the EU cannot achieve this alone, as the national governments need to agree to it. We need to overcome the anxieties in our population. Criminals are everywhere - they do not need a visa! They cross borders without a visa. That is therefore not something that we should be concerned about.It is about the young generation, who, with the help of visa-free travel, can finally go wherever they want to. We are therefore very pleased that the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will now finally be able to travel freely again. How wonderful! There is still a hint of sadness in that Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo cannot yet join them, but in December, we expect the Commission to acknowledge the huge progress that Albania has made and to see that Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made a certain amount of improvement. Unfortunately, there are politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are less concerned about the interests of their citizens, as they are secure in the knowledge that they themselves, of course, have visa-free travel. I therefore believe that we need to ensure that this is possible by next summer. I hope that Mr Barrot will help us in that. However, we must not forget Kosovo. It must not be the last remaining black mark. We are obliged to help Kosovo to meet the benchmarks. It cannot do it alone. Visa-free travel is a deeply humanitarian act. I am pleased that we were all in a position to make this happen. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr Barrot.\nPERSON241 : (HU) Europe and the European Union started off as a peace project and are now going through the longest peacetime period in history. Therefore, we are aware of what a powerful instrument integration can be from this perspective. Now we have to use it to deal with the Western Balkans.The Western Balkans have only recently gone through an extremely traumatic period of war, causing great suffering to a huge number of people. Progress needs to be made with the process of European integration in order to overcome this event. Visa-free travel is an important step in this. Several people have mentioned the opportunity it would provide young people with to establish direct contact and gain first-hand experience, as well as the opportunity for democratic forces to grow in strength. It is not only about providing a message of trust and visa-free travel. Europe can also benefit from the Western Balkans moving closer to the European Union from a security and economic policy perspective. However, it is important that we do not create new divisions in the region, but ensure that every country can participate in the visa-free travel scheme as soon as possible.\nPERSON242 : (NL) Tomorrow, the European Parliament will be voting on the abolition of the short-stay visa requirement for Balkan countries. Not all the countries for whom a road map was drawn up are eligible to receive the waiver on 1 January.It is very unfortunate that, in one country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission proposal permits a disparity between different sections of the population: those able to benefit from visa-free travel to Europe on Croatian or Serbian passports and those - the Bosnian Muslims - who are not in possession of such a passport. This is an embarrassing distinction in view of the country's recent history.It is up to the European Parliament to send a signal to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania tomorrow. Criteria are criteria, and these requirements need to be met in order to qualify for the visa waiver. As soon as the benchmarks have been met, however, the visa waiver must be granted as soon as possible.We have seen that a great deal has been done to meet the benchmarks, and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to meet all the requirements as soon as possible.\nPERSON243 : (SL) For the citizens of the Western Balkans, the abolition of the visa requirement for travel to the European Union does not only have a technical dimension, but an exceptional political charge and significance as well. Today, we rightly commemorated in Parliament the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and of full-blown socialism. However, Skopje, Podgorica and Belgrade will, during this Christmas and New Year, finally get to celebrate the fall of a visa wall which has separated them from us in the European Union for almost 12 years.For nearly 20 years, the majority of the population of the former Yugoslavia has been denied the opportunity of travelling freely across Europe, which is something they were used to previously, when they were still citizens of the now collapsed socialist federation. We are beginning to see the ugly consequences of such isolation, which has lasted an entire generation, and it is high time that we put an end to it.However, the Macedonians, the Montenegrins and the Serbs should be joined by the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, the Albanians and the Kosovars as early as possible in 2010. That alone will enable the new generations of those countries to finally see and experience the outside world, establish contacts with other Europeans, contribute to the development of European values at home and equip their nations for fully-fledged membership in our common European story - the European Union.As Parliament rapporteur for Macedonia, I have received a large number of phone calls in recent days from citizens of various Balkan countries. I wish to reassure them, loud and clear, that their visa-free travel to the EU is not a substitute for their accession to the EU. What their free travel in the EU amounts to is a step towards fully-fledged membership of the EU.\nPERSON244 : (HU) I would like to welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. I also want to say that as far as I can see, on this 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, guaranteeing the crossing of borders in the case of Western Balkan countries becomes part of the series of events that started 20 years ago, like a new wall collapsing.This is why this proposal should be welcomed. However, we must not forget that the issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one, while it is a very clear political matter at the same time. This is why it is important. I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility. This responsibility also means action at the same time. First of all, it means action by the relevant states which have been unable to meet the visa-free travel conditions to fulfil these requirements as soon as possible, not to mention action from the European Commission without whose help this process would drag on.\nPERSON245 : (DE) Madam President, I believe that we are on the right track with regard to the Balkan States. We have drawn closer through visa facilitation and that will help to create stability, although it is also a sign of our appreciation of the efforts that have been made. However, I also think that it is good for us to retain a clear set of rules and for the requirements relating to these also to be complied with. In this regard, I would particularly like to thank Mrs Corazza Bildt for the efforts she has made.Anything else would, in my opinion, be a pure Brussels-based decision, in which a clear system would be abandoned and no honesty would be shown to the people affected in the Balkan States, just as little as is shown to our own people. Political signals should not be placed in a footnote or in an annex to a European directive or regulation; they need to be formulated properly.\nPERSON246 : (PL) Madam President, I am glad that the citizens of Western Balkan countries will be able to move freely around the European Union. This will facilitate interpersonal contact, extend business possibilities and create conditions for the residents of the region to get to know the European Union better.We cannot, however, allow our Eastern neighbours to be isolated. We cannot deny them the opportunity which we are giving to other European countries. We must establish for them, too, clear criteria and an action plan for greater liberalisation of visa traffic. We have to bear in mind that the cost of a visa is a considerable expense for the residents of these countries, and the application procedures take a long time, which restricts the possibilities for developing a whole range of forms of cooperation.We should also remember that in 2012, the European football championships will be held in Poland and Ukraine, so the possibility of free movement will be especially important.\nPERSON247 : (RO) I, too, wish to stress the importance of freedom of movement as a fundamental right, and I reconfirm that numerous citizens from countries in the Western Balkans will enjoy this right. I obviously welcome this openness.However, at the same time, I wish to deplore the fact that this report ultimately did not feature any reference at all to a country included in the Eastern Partnership. I believe that it needed to be associated with Moldova, if only symbolically. We are talking about Moldova, a country which has made considerable progress on the political front. I think that the most solid wall we know in Europe is on the eastern border, between Romania and Moldova. I believe we must deplore this fact.\nPERSON248 : Madam President, my thanks to all of the speakers who have largely supported the process of abolishing visas for three leading Balkan States. You made it clear that freedom of movement was obviously very desirable. As Mr Moraes said, it is beneficial for both parties - for Europe and for the Balkan States.At the same time as thanking all of the speakers and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, I would simply like to say, Madam President, that, ever since part of the decisions were pretty much taken for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, we have offered continual assistance to Albania, which I have visited personally, and to Bosnia and Herzegovina, precisely so as to help them make progress - and we shall continue to do so.I believe that the very swift adoption of this resolution is a good indicator of the way in which we will be able to move on quickly to the other states and, in particular, to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Albania, without forgetting, of course, Kosovo.\nPERSON250 : rapporteur. - Mr President, once again I thank all those who made contributions, which prove that the European Union strongly supports visa liberalisation for all the countries of the Western Balkans.I regret that the Swedish Minister was not here, because we had very good cooperation. I welcome the Commission's commitment to do everything possible to accelerate the process for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania, and I hope both countries will introduce visa-free regimes once they meet the criteria - as soon as possible, possibly in summer next year.I want to say that I involved everyone in this, and I am fully aware of what the treaties prescribe. But this is a political House, and we all do serious politics as best we can.Once again, I welcome the abolition of visas for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro on 19 December, and I really hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania can follow as soon as possible. We are talking about the destiny of the young generation. It is our political responsibility to finish this visa liberalisation process, and we also have to find a solution for all the people in Kosovo.Thank you very much for your cooperation.\nPERSON251 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.Written statements (Rule 149)\nPERSON252 : in writing. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for drafting an acceptable compromise on this matter. The issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one. It is also a very definite political matter. Visa-free travel is based on mutual trust and commitments. This is why I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration, in addition to the report, because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility.Responsibility, of course, also means action. First of all, it means action by the relevant states which have been unable to meet the visa-free travel conditions. They must do their utmost so that these conditions are met as soon as possible. It also means action by the European Commission without whose effective help this process would only drag on, which cannot be in our interest. It also concerns Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo.As a Hungarian MEP, I would like once again to mention that, thanks to visa-free travel status for Serbia, a more direct link is being established between Hungarians living in Vojvodina in Serbia and the mother country, not to mention with Europe too. Citizens who live on either side of these borders, speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties are unable, for their part, to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa. Today we are marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and cutting through the barbed wire. Guaranteeing the crossing of borders in the case of Western Balkan countries becomes part of the series of events that started 20 years ago, like a new wall collapsing"

"transcript": "PERSON175 : The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council onjoint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease - B7-0218/2009)The author, Herbert Reul, has indicated that he is running late. If he arrives, he may be given the floor at the end.\nPERSON176 : Mr President, in the absence of Mr Reul, I will repeat this question that we are putting to the Commission. In accordance with the legal basis of Article 165 of the treaty, the Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases calls for Parliament to be consulted.We want to know whether the Council can confirm its intention to adopt conclusions on this issue during the Competitiveness Council of 3 December 2009. Moreover, since Parliament was consulted on the Commission's proposal, is the Council prepared to take Parliament's views into account when drafting its conclusions?Next, regarding possible future joint programming of research activities, can the Council confirm its opinion that these initiatives should, in principle, be adopted using the same legal basis?I should like to point out that we have drafted a resolution. This resolution has the support of all the political groups and it is important because, quite simply, it highlights the challenges of an ageing population - these challenges that mean that, today, in Europe, we have more than seven million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a figure that it is estimated will double over the next 20 years.It is therefore crucial to plan, invest and cooperate in this area in order to control the social costs of these diseases, and to offer hope, dignity and a healthier life to the millions of sufferers and their families. These health and social problems, which affect the whole of Europe, require coordinated measures designed to ensure the effectiveness of the prevention, diagnoses, treatment and care provided to the people concerned.Special attention must be paid to support for the research and innovation work carried out by public and private operators in an effort to find new cures and to prevent the development of these diseases. Health research is even more fragmented at European level, and the number of public-private partnerships must be increased. The example of the Innovative Medicines initiative, launched in February 2008, must not remain a one-off experiment.I shall conclude by saying that this really is a race against the clock, for we must forestall these diseases as much as possible. Research today shows that there are already initiatives aimed at pre-diagnosis. It is on these concrete issues that our fellow citizens are expecting signals from the Europe for health, which must give guarantees and anticipate the development of age-related diseases.\nPERSON177 : Mr President, the proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's, which was adopted by the Commission on 22 July, is based on Article 165 of the treaty. This article talks about coordination of research and technological development activities between the Community and the Member States, precisely to ensure greater consistency between national policies and Community policy.Article 165 accords with the objectives for joint programming initiatives. These objectives are based on the idea that we jointly establish the challenges that our societies are collectively facing and that, through increased political commitment on the part of the Member States, we can agree on joint or coordinated responses to these challenges. The aim, of course, is to increase efficiency in the public financing of research in Europe.However, I believe that the problem and the key to your question is that Article 165 does not give the Council the right to act. This article constitutes a legal basis for the Commission to take possible initiatives to promote coordination between the Member States and the Community's policy. There is no other legal basis in the treaty under the heading of research that the Commission could use to propose measures relating to joint programming initiatives.There is, of course, a very strong political commitment within the Council for introducing pilot initiatives for joint programming aimed at combating Alzheimer's, in particular, as soon as possible. In the light of this, it is the Presidency's view that the Council should adopt conclusions on this joint programming initiative on the basis of the text that has been tabled by the Commission.I know that the European Parliament gives high priority to the fight against Alzheimer's disease. In a declaration issued in February, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to recognise this fight as a European public health priority. You are, of course, familiar with the Commission's proposal. The Presidency will try to ensure that Parliament's views are, as far as possible, incorporated into the conclusions that are to be adopted when the Competitiveness Council meets on 3 December this year.As regards possible future joint programming initiatives, the Council shares the Member's view that a common approach should be chosen to adopt these initiatives under the research heading. Unfortunately, there is currently only one method available and that is to adopt Council conclusions for each separate initiative. This is because the treaty contains no appropriate legal basis for adopting other measures.\nPERSON178 : The Swedish Presidency wishes to adopt in December the conclusions regarding the measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases without even waiting for Parliament's view on this issue.I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on this dossier and, given these circumstances, I support the adoption of a resolution to express Parliament's position on the measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease, through joint programming of research activities.Neurodegenerative diseases pose a major health problem in Europe. Advances in medical science and the standard of living in developed countries have created conditions resulting in an increase in life expectancy, but the number of people affected by neurodegenerative disease has also risen.This is a problem which has a number of different aspects to it. Some aspects relate to the quality of life of those affected by these diseases, the impact which the disease has on their close family or on those who care for them. It is equally a problem affecting the sustainability of the health care systems which will have to cope with an increased number of patients, at a time when, as a result of the ageing population, the proportion of people no longer working is on the rise.The Commission's proposal focuses on the research-related aspects. The resolution which we are proposing equally emphasises the results which will be achieved through coordinating research activities and the extent to which they will help improve the current situation. Therefore, I urge our efforts to be focused in two main areas: scientific research and ensuring that the efforts made are reflected in the results achieved in terms of the quality of care which patients can enjoy.Bearing in mind the interest which Parliament has shown over time in this area and the importance of this dossier, which is a pilot project for the joint programming of research activities, it is vital that Parliament's position is taken into account when drafting the Council's conclusions.Parliament must be involved in all initiatives relating to future joint programming in the field of research. In fact, Article 182 of the Treaty of Lisbon ensures a suitable legal basis for future developments in this area.\nPERSON179 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research.Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project - this has been said and it is the subject of our question. While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council's deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research.We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages. We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures. Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial.I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients' and relatives' associations. From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research.If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level.\nPERSON180 : Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases. The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject. The diseases that we are discussing today - Alzheimer's disease, although Parkinson's disease is also referred to in the text - are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe. The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe. Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation.The Group of the United European Left - Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available. I think this motion is a good one. Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better. Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents. It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this. In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution.\nPERSON181 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should have been rapporteur on this dossier, so I feel a bit disappointed. However, I am happy that we are moving forward. It is not the time for an interinstitutional dispute. I am happy that the Council is prepared to move.I have a number of observations to make. Indeed, we hope here in Parliament that the Council will take on board the ideas in the resolutions that we are going to vote on tomorrow.I would emphasise the need to have the right balance between - like in climate change - mitigation and adaptation. Here, I am speaking about preventing this disease and understanding why it happens, what the factors are, so we can really prevent it effectively, because that is always the most effective and also the least expensive way of fighting disease.Is the joint programming initiative enough? Well, not in the sense that this should become the norm, that in such major undertakings, working together should be the norm, not just a voluntary thing, but something that would really bind all Member States into working together effectively.Secondly, on financial priorities, the first question is: are we spending enough on these types of diseases? We believe this is not the case and we would strongly encourage, within the forthcoming framework programmes, taking some money from big programmes like ITER, which the best scientists are telling us will pay off maybe in 60 years, and put some of that money into research into Alzheimer's disease and other diseases of a similar nature. I think that this is really needed.\nPERSON182 : First of all, I would like to express my complete support with regard to the question that was asked by Mr Reul and, in particular, to point out that the fundamental issue - the fundamental political issue here - is precisely a matter of joint programming of research.What happened on the issue of joint programming on neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease, was that the rules changed in the middle of the process. We went from having a report to having a resolution, thereby taking away our codecision powers on this issue. We stopped being MEPs and instead became advisers. I would therefore like to know, at least, whether what we recommend will be taken into account or not.Programming research activities, in any area, is a political choice and not a technical choice and, in this regard, Parliament's role should be emphasised and strengthened. In my view, defining priorities that are political means that they should be scrutinised, should be transparent and should be democratic. What happened in relation to the joint decision and joint programming of research on Alzheimer's disease is a process that should not be repeated. Should it ever be repeated, please at least give us plenty of warning. I therefore hope that the last thing that can happen is that the decisions and the recommendations tabled by Parliament on this issue are not taken into consideration.\nPERSON184 : Madam President, in my constituency of Northern Ireland, we currently have 16 000 people suffering from dementia. They, their families and their carers will welcome a proactive approach to tackling this disease, which can be so devastating to both sufferers and families.It is in areas like this that I believe it is good to see cooperation across European states. I believe that a coordinated approach to tackling disease can bring forward new evidence, new medical breakthroughs and, in time, hopefully improve treatment and cure.In the United Kingdom, we currently have just over 400 000 people suffering from Alzheimer's. This United Kingdom figure is likely to be something in the region of 750 000 people by 2025. It is therefore imperative that something is done to improve our diagnosis, treatment and prevention and social research into the welfare of patients and their families, particularly families who act as carers. A coordinated approach and a sharing of research are vital, as long as that research respects the sanctity of human life in all its forms.\nPERSON185 : (PT) I welcome the initiatives and the actions undertaken at European level to combat neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease. The Member States have been developing research efforts in this field. It is important that cooperation among Member States is encouraged, to ensure increased coordination in terms of scientific research and technological development, and avoid fragmentation.Joint programming of research is a valuable tool for reducing fragmentation by involving, at European level, the Member States, the public sector and the private sector. This joint programming tool will be vital for the future of the European Research Area. Developing the European Research Area lies at the heart of the research policy of the Treaty of Lisbon.However, I am concerned about the implementation of this joint programming tool in terms of bureaucratic complexity and delays in administrative procedures. I would therefore like to ask what the plans are for using a process based on economy of scale, combining efficiency, simplification and fast-tracking of administrative procedures so as to promote excellence and to encourage collaboration at European level, as called for by the importance of this issue.\nPERSON186 : Madam President, as a former health care professional of over 30 years, it was distressing to learn that Parliament would not be consulted regarding the Commission's new proposals on Alzheimer's disease. However, we must move on.As Europe's population becomes older, the impact of Alzheimer's will become deeper too. The number of Alzheimer's cases worldwide is predicted to grow from 35 million today to 107 million cases in 2050.One of the most harrowing aspects of Alzheimer's disease is the many people it affects apart from the patient. In Ireland, for example, there are 50 000 listed carers to cater for Ireland's 44 000 sufferers. This disease is often called a family disease because of the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline.The further role of the European Parliament in the fight against Alzheimer's disease should not be discounted. Any new direction by the EU should take account of Parliament's unique voice on the matter and should move to assist not just Alzheimer's sufferers but also the many carers who work to increase their quality of life.\nPERSON187 : Madam President, obviously, coordinating research in this area is really important, and this is not just about Alzheimer's disease, as the term 'neurodegenerative' covers a multitude of diseases.Parliament actually has a very significant role to play in how that research will be done. I draw attention to the ongoing discussions between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the welfare of animals used in scientific experimentation. I am concerned - and hopeful, because of our rapporteur and the direction of the talks - that we continue to allow necessary research using animals in a way that is more welfare friendly than perhaps it is now. This is because we need research in this area in order to do the things that have been spoken about to prevent, and to treat people - and we may be amongst them ourselves in time - who unfortunately may be affected by these diseases.I hope we can have an early agreement at second reading on this very important directive. While we may not have had a great input into this particular issue, we will have had one into the ongoing research.\nPERSON188 : (PL) Madam President, the question of the battle against this disease was raised - and credit should be given for this - during the French Presidency. It was said then that the EU should take action in this matter. It would be good if the next Presidency took up this matter and treated it with equal importance. It has already been said here that this problem affects millions of people and their families, who are all suffering.When we meet our constituents, we often hear this question: what does the EU do for the citizens of Europe? What are you there for? What are you responsible for? What do you do? It is just this type of question which should be the subject of efforts to build an image of authority and importance for the European Union. This is what our citizens need. Joint efforts to combat diseases of this kind must be a priority for the EU institutions.\nPERSON189 : (EL) Madam President, I take the problem of combating neurodegenerative diseases - and especially Alzheimer's - extremely seriously.It is therefore very useful to have and achieve coordinated action between the Member States of the European Union in combating the causes and in addressing the problem of prevention and treatment and the consequences which such diseases have on patients, on society as a whole and on the public health of the citizens of the European Union.I believe that the priority and main approach should be in the field of prevention and not in the field of medication. The Member States should also be encouraged to set up monitoring centres for patients and their carers and to secure equal scientific participation by the Member States in this research endeavour by the European Union.Finally, the database created in agreement with the Council and the Member States must be under public and state ownership within the framework of national systems and the conclusions must be publicised at a public world forum. Finally, it is up to us to control the budget for this issue.\nPERSON190 : (LT) Certainly, I agree that at this time, it is particularly important to devote attention to scientific research to ensure help for people suffering from Alzheimer's, as our European Union unites 27 Member States and not all states are equally able to offer assistance to Alzheimer sufferers. There are different health care systems, different social service systems, different support for those families with such a patient. Therefore, this scientific research is vitally important and we must concentrate and find, first of all, funding, coordinated work and coordinated activities. Secondly, it is very important that there is funding to implement that research and offer real support to people suffering from that disease, as well as their families.\nPERSON191 : (DE) Madam President, I will be very brief. The importance of this has already been stated by several speakers. It is a disease that affects many people and that number is growing. It is even more essential for the Member States to work together, to combine forces, in order to be effective. As far as this goes, this is a right and sensible path to take.It is a shame that, when it comes to the procedures, we have difficulty getting Parliament involved. It is regrettable that this resolution had to be prepared at the last minute. However, if a good result is achieved in the end, then that is what is important.\nPERSON192 : Madam President, Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases are dreadful. I believe that many of us who have seen a relative affected by Alzheimer's know how it can destroy a previously healthy person and how painful it is for family and other relatives, and I feel very strongly that we need to invest more resources in researching this terrible disease.It is clear that we need to take new steps to better coordinate our knowledge and research in Europe, and the Commission's pilot initiative aims to mobilise the best researchers we have to attempt to understand, cure and prevent both Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases.Within the framework of the current troika between France, the Czech Republic and now Sweden, we discussed at an early stage the importance of including Alzheimer's as a joint priority issue in the context of the work relating to public health. The French Presidency held a very important conference, as one of the honourable Members mentioned, and the Swedish Presidency held a conference in September on dignified ageing, with Alzheimer's as one of the items on the agenda.As I said, the Council intends to adopt conclusions on this on 3 December, and we will, of course, take into account the excellent resolution that you have produced and that you will vote on tomorrow. I am certain that the issue of Alzheimer's will come up again within the framework of the research programme and similar initiatives in the very near future, so thank you very much for raising this very important issue.\nPERSON193 : A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow.Written statements (Rule 149)\nPERSON990 : I welcome the proposal for a recommendation of the Commission on joint programming of research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases. The population's mental health is a vital issue for ensuring a decent quality of life. Diseases of this type are affecting an ever-increasing number of people in the EU. This is why efforts are required to combat the factors responsible for triggering these diseases. However, in order to combat these factors, they need to be identified through research. I believe that the pilot project for joint programming of research activities offers a definite advantage in terms of pooling the efforts for funding research, which will result in a more efficient use of the funds earmarked for research in this area. Furthermore, cooperation based on networks created by national research centres and the joint use of the required infrastructure are all the more beneficial, given that not all Member States have the necessary resources to undertake research activities at their own expense, even though they are facing a high number of cases involving neurodegenerative diseases. It will be paramount for the research results to be used to inform the population about the ways of supporting mental health, thereby helping reduce the number of patients and maintain the viability of national public health care systems.\nPERSON194 : Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's communication to Parliament offers an optimistic analysis of the expected benefits of cooperation in research among Member States and of the coordination that the Commission can carry out, in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme, with regard to neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer's disease in particular. The measures proposed in the communication only concern the principle of making better use of existing resources and programmes: the 'Health' Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme, the EU Action Plan on disabilities, the open method of coordination and the Statistical Programme. Will optimising our use of these resources be enough to achieve the expected results? What coordination mechanisms is the Commission proposing that could not have been implemented before the communication? What added value does it provide? What new, practical measures is the Commission thinking of adopting to stimulate cooperation in research, in a situation where resources and teams already exist, although they are fragmented? Will giving greater visibility to the issue and using existing instruments be enough to resolve it?\nPERSON989 : in writing. - I support this Resolution welcoming the proposed pilot project for joint programming of research activities in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease affect more than seven million citizens of the European Union. No cures are currently available for neurodegenerative diseases and knowledge about prevention, treatment, and identification of risk factors is very limited. Indeed, most of the research effort in the field of neurodegenerative diseases is carried out by Member States, with a relatively low level of transnational coordination, leading to fragmentation and limited sharing of knowledge and best practices among Member States. Joint programming could be highly valuable in reducing fragmentation of the research effort, leading as it would to a pooling of a critical mass of skills, knowledge and financial resources. However, Article 182(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon, which establishes measures necessary for the implementation of the European research area, could provide a more appropriate legal basis for future joint programming initiatives in the field of research. The Commission should consider using Article 182(5) as a legal basis for all future proposals for joint programming of research activities.\nPERSON988 : Madam President, Alzheimer's disease is a confusing illness that changes the sufferer's world into somewhere unknown and perilous. Life becomes a highly dangerous 'now', where there are no past memories and lessons learnt to build a bridge of security to the present moment. Moreover, this fateful human tragedy is made all the worse by the fact that there is no known cure for the disease at this time. The illness also involves the suffering of close relatives. It is sometimes called a family illness, with relatives often suffering from chronic stress. The social impact is enormous and takes a heavy toll. As the population ages in Europe, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are becoming more and more a public health issue: there are now more than seven million patients, and that number is expected to double in the next decade. Medical science, however, still does not even fully understand the causes of the disease. There are some promising findings from research, but we need coordinated efforts if we are to achieve a breakthrough. In order to compile the data from the research of private and public organisations and the Member States and coordinate their innovations, we need Community programming: that way, there is hope that more effective prevention, diagnoses and treatment with regard to these diseases will become a reality as soon as possible in practical care work. I am convinced that the people who are struggling with neurodegenerative diseases - the patients, relatives and carers - will vigorously support any collaborative attempts to look for new ways to deal with these conditions. It is just these sorts of projects that tell our citizens why we are here today at all: they justify the Union's entire existence. I agree with my colleague, Mr Reul, that procedure and competence take second place when one is actually headed in the right direction.\nPERSON987 : Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the summer, the Commission adopted the Council's recommendation urging the Member States of the EU to engage in joint programming of research into neurodegenerative diseases. This is important if even better use is to be made of the limited resources for research. We need to remember, however, that, in addition to research, Europe needs a more extensive action programme on dementia. Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved a written statement calling on the Commission to draft an action plan on Alzheimer's disease. Parliament's statement emphasised the importance of four issues: developments in research, early diagnosis, improved quality of life for patients and their carers, and the status of the Alzheimer's associations. I would like to remind everyone that the programme is urgent and the Commission needs to get started on the action that Parliament has asked it to take.\nPERSON195 : In our increasingly elderly society, the number of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or senile dementia will continue to increase. In order to be as prepared for this as possible, we need to create better research structures and make better use of the existing facilities. The planned pilot project in this area is an ideal starting point for interlinking the current research efforts better. However, prevention is also important alongside providing the best possible care for those affected. The Member States need to step up their information campaigns regarding an active lifestyle."

"transcript": "PERSON149 : The next item is the debate onthe oral question to the Council on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Heide R\u00fchle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0216/2009), andthe oral question to the Commission on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Bu\u015foi, Heide R\u00fchle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0219/2009).\nPERSON150 : author. - Madam President, it is a privilege to be able to make my first intervention in the Chamber since being elected as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to present this question on behalf of all the political groups on the committee as well as the coordinators. I am very pleased that many new members of the committee are here tonight to support me and to contribute to the debate.I do not think that this House needs any reminding about the importance of the Services Directive. In unleashing the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the European economy, the jobs that it will create, and the dynamic effect of that, are sorely needed at the moment in the stagnant conditions that we face.This is a very wide-ranging directive. It has many new features. It is complicated in many areas. It has needed a lot of attention. The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation. At the very core of this directive is the fact that Member States will remove barriers to business and, in particular, measures in their own national legislation that discriminate against service companies who want to do business. Believe me, there are literally hundreds of legislative proposals or pieces of legislation in different countries that have had to be amended as a result of this proposal. Unless all colleagues move together to do this, and all countries move together to do this, that discrimination is going to remain. This has to be done consistently. Otherwise, those barriers will remain.That is why I want first of all to pay tribute particularly to the Commission for the leading role it has played in managing and coordinating the whole process among Member States of carrying out and transposing this legislation. I also want to thank the Council and, indeed, successive Councils, since this proposal was agreed back in 2006, who have led the process which we have actually seen in summits calling for the consistent transposition of this directive.I want to say particularly to Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Minister here tonight, how impressed the committee was with the work that Sweden was doing when we went to visit Sweden on a mission back in September. I think that they have clearly set an example to many other people and, in particular, in the meticulous way in which they are ensuring that public authorities at all levels in Sweden understand their obligations under European law in order to be able to authorise service companies coming from other places within the European Union.Our question tonight focuses, in particular, on what we regard as the most important elements to be put in place as soon as possible. Member States have been required to go through the screening process of their legislation to look, as I say, for those discriminatory elements. But the transposition on 28 December is just the start of the process of removing obstacles, because every country is now going to come up with a list of proposals which discriminate against other countries and which, they believe, they can justify in the public interest. That mutual evaluation process - which is an entirely new one - requires other Member State authorities to look at each other, at each other's discriminatory proposals. That is going to be a vital part that starts, and we are following that with great interest. We would like to hear tonight how the Commission is proposing to approach that process. We would like to know from the Council what support they are giving to that. We would also like an assurance that this is not going to be a process done behind closed doors, because consumers and businesses and other interest groups will want to know how that process is being carried out. We want to see that list. We want to see the list of regulations and internal statutes that Member States want to retain.Second is information and access to procedures through electronic technology. Setting up the points of single contact for business is a ground-breaking proposal, again, in any European directive. Member States are required to make that information and access to the procedures necessary for businesses to complete to allow them to trade through those systems. It is vital that we have full and complete systems set up.So that is what our question is here tonight. We look forward to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner - perhaps in a field that is not so familiar to her - giving us some comprehensive answers. We know you will give our best wishes to Charlie McCreevy from everybody.I think it is important to understand, however, the perspective of my committee. For us, this is also the start of a process over the next five years of monitoring and sustaining political interest and pressure on all the Member States to deliver this directive. I have to say to Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m that it was disappointing, to say the least, to see in the report that a Competitiveness Council discussed back in September a note from the Commission that, it would appear, in some Member States the political commitment to full and timely implementation has unfortunately not been translated into appropriate action. That is not good enough. We want the benefits and we want them now.\nPERSON151 : Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Harbour and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for raising this important issue. Just as Mr Harbour said, the free movement of services is one of the cornerstones of the internal market. It accounts for 60-70% of the EU's economy and employment and it is growing. It will play a very important part in the EU's economic growth, but as has also been pointed out, the free movement of services has not worked as well as it should have done. There is still much to be done to remove barriers to trade and to facilitate the trade in services, and it is excellent therefore that we now have the Services Directive, which is to be transposed by 28 December.The Commission is ultimately responsible for the Member States doing what they are supposed to do and I am sure that the Commission will talk about this, but I will nevertheless say a few words on behalf of the Presidency on the basis of the question that has been put to me by the committee. The first thing I would like to say is about the screening of legislation and how it has contributed to the implementation. The purpose of this is to identify and eliminate barriers to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. The requirements relating to the provision of services that the Member States retain must comply with the requirements for non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality.This is a huge task, but when it is finished, the service sector will benefit from a reduction in the administrative burden for companies providing services. The final report to the Commission on this should be ready on 28 December.The national points of contact are to gather information concerning rights and requirements in the services sector for service providers and the recipients of services. They are to give service providers the opportunity to apply for authorisation online and to communicate with the authorisation authority. Of course, this is quite difficult for the Member States to organise. It is based on the idea of us having a more modern system with a high degree of e-governance. Next week, the Swedish Presidency is holding a ministerial meeting in Malm\u00f6 on precisely the subject of e-governance. At this meeting, the Member States will receive support from the Commission and a lot of seminars will be held to enable us to learn from one another so that we can make user-friendliness the main focus.Another important issue is the language used on the web portals and the option of being able to use this facility in a language other than the Member States' own. This is not a requirement in the directive, but hopefully most Member States will have information in several languages at the points of contact. This will give service providers a better opportunity to compare different markets and obtain the overview needed to be able to expand their operations.The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection asks whether the Member States will be able to implement the directive in time, and I hope that they will be able to. The Commission will have to answer this, but in fact, in the Competitiveness Council, all Member States stated that they would be ready in time. Political support for this is, of course, very important.What are the biggest challenges, then? The directive as a whole is, of course, extremely wide-ranging and it requires a number of measures to be taken by the Member States, not only in terms of legislation, but also various measures to facilitate cooperation. These structures that we will hopefully have in place will make governance more efficient and more up-to-date. However, it will take time to put this in place. Screening the legislation in this huge area and finding legislative solutions cannot be accomplished overnight. Authorities will need to be trained with regard to their new duties, and this will require resources.So the answer to the question of what the biggest challenges are is, of course, the setting up of the points of single contact and ensuring that they work. Lastly, Parliament asks how the interested stakeholders have been involved. This is an important question, because it is, of course, a fundamental part of the process for the various stakeholder organisations to be involved in creating an understanding of the Services Directive, communicating the advantages to citizens and companies, but also discovering their views and needs.This dialogue has been a key element. Many interested stakeholders were already involved in reference groups during the negotiation period and in many cases, these networks have continued. In many countries, there has been broad social consultation on the proposals for implementation in order to obtain various pieces of information and views.Finally, Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it is showing in the process of implementing the Services Directive. In view of the very important role that the European Parliament played in reaching an agreement, it is good that you remain interested and are checking and ensuring that we are doing what we are supposed to do in the Member States. We agree that it is especially important for the directive to be put in place promptly and in the correct way, and, particularly now during the economic crisis, the Services Directive will be an important tool to take us out of the crisis and allow us once again to concentrate on economic growth and, hopefully, to create jobs.\nPERSON152 : Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for putting forward this timely oral question, particularly also on behalf of my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, on the state of the implementation of the Services Directive.It is a little less than two months before the implementation deadline, and it is a good time to look back on the work that has been done so far and to take stock of where things are today.The Services Directive is one of the most important initiatives adopted in recent years. It has a great potential to remove barriers to trade in the internal market and to modernise our public administrations, and proper implementation becomes even more pressing in the current economic context. We know that very well and the European Parliament, and in particular, its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, have not only played a key role in making its adoption possible but the Commission also particularly appreciated your continued interest in monitoring the work done by the Member States to implement the directive.For our part, the Commission has delivered on its commitment to facilitate the implementation process. This was already mentioned. We have taken Member States' requests for technical assistance seriously and we have deployed unprecedented efforts and resources to support their work. More than 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held and expert groups met in Brussels over 30 times during the last three years.But the Commission cannot carry out the implementation at national level. This is the role of Member States, and transposing the Services Directive has been a challenging task for them.It has been challenging because it involved the carrying out of several large-scale projects, such as the setting-up of 'points of single contact' and the review and simplification of legislation relating to services. It has been challenging also because it involved intensive coordination between all levels of the administration, be it at national, regional or local level.So where do things stand today? And will Member States deliver?Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of 2009 deadline or in the beginning of 2010. Some Member States might be late. This is not entirely satisfactory, in particular, for citizens and businesses wanting to make use of their rights in the internal market. Although the situation is not unusual compared to other internal market directives, it gives some reason for concern.But it must also be taken into account that, perhaps more than for any other directive, Member States needed to address a huge amount of difficult legal and practical issues. And given this, the result that we hope to achieve by the beginning of next year may actually be considered as quite good.Let me now reply in more detail to your question.So, almost all Member States have completed the process of 'screening' their national legislation. Some are still working on it. The extent to which the screening has contributed to an effective transposition of the directive is, of course, also somewhat difficult to assess at this stage. The transposition deadline has not yet expired, and Member States have not yet submitted their legislative changes to the Commission.But it is clear that an ambitious and thorough process of screening is crucial to ensure the 'internal market friendliness' of national legislation in each and every Member State. And it is also crucial for the competitiveness of our services sector in general.As regards the points of single contact, it seems clear that most Member States will at least have basic, practical, point-of-single-contact solutions in place by the end of 2009. These will, again, not be totally perfect, but they should form a solid basis. Member States should continue developing and upgrading the points of single contact which, in the long run, should become fully-fledged e-government centres.In this context, the Commission agrees with the importance of providing additional information and procedures through the points of single contact, such as those related to workers rights and taxation. Businesses and consumers need to be aware of the applicable rules. But as you know, this is not mandatory under the directive.We expect, as the points of single contact consolidate and develop, this information will also be provided. Indeed, some Member States are already planning to do so.As regards the implementation of the directive in the area of social services - to the extent that they are covered by it - this does not seem to have raised particular problems. The directive itself contains mechanisms to ensure the specificities of these services are taken into account.Finally, I think it is clear that stakeholders have played a vital role throughout the implementation process. They have followed Member States' efforts closely and have been involved in implementation in different ways, and we will ensure that stakeholders are consulted next year during the evaluation of the results of the implementation.So we need to find a method to ensure that this consultation is targeted and very concrete.Finally, many Member States have had open consultation on the draft implementing legislation during the legislative process. Some stakeholder organisations have even organised regular surveys with their members on the state of implementation. Let us say it is important to be realistic and honest at this stage of the process. A lot still remains to be done in the area of implementation, and those Member States who are behind schedule need to make extra efforts.I remain convinced, however, that the glass is more than half full. But we had better keep filling it and quickly.\nPERSON154 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have just heard from the Commission and the Council is somewhat discouraging.Europe faces international competition, global competition, in which European service providers also need to find their place and be successful. If we look at the history of this directive, which started life in Parliament with a significant level of participation by the Members, it is, in my view, rather discouraging to hear that the glass is half full, or half empty, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said. President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament has not only played a role in the past, but intends to fulfil its role in future, too. We have therefore decided, within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to address this question to you in good time before the transposition deadline in order to check whether you, as the Member States of the European Union, have undertaken your obligations, which were originally proposed by you, to transpose this directive by the end of this year, and whether you are able to meet this target. At least as far as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, I am still assuming that you will do everything you can to fulfil your claim in the coming months.We will appraise the directive and its implementation from the point of view of the citizens of Europe, the service providers and the workers, and against this background we will examine closely how the Member States behave towards one another and the level of transparency - as mentioned by the Chairman - with which the exchange of views over the elements of the directive is carried out and how effectively the Member States' regulations are screened for their suitability for the internal market as far as service providers are concerned. The same applies to the scope of the directive. Here, too, as we have done in the past, we will observe closely the degree to which the European Court of Justice might interpret the EU Treaty so as to give priority to the rights of citizens and that - as we sometimes get the impression happens in the Council - the interests of the Member States do not always take priority.Secondly, we are very pleased about the point you mentioned with regard to the electronic management of the process, but the key issue in our view is whether service providers can ultimately carry out all the tasks required under the procedure in a simple and effective way using the online process and whether, behind these many home pages, they will actually find people they can talk to about the matter and about the requirements in the Member States, or whether we are not simply constructing walls and barriers here.Ladies and gentlemen, the President is asking me to be quick. I would like to come to my last point. In the previous debate, Parliament called, in particular, for the Internal Market Information System to remove all the problems that the administrations of the Member States may reasonably experience in connection with the transposition of the directive, and I therefore hope, Mrs Malmstr\u00f6m, that you will make every effort to ensure that this directive can enter into force on 31 December this year.\nPERSON155 : Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one. I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found. This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest. That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place.However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered. It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive. This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive. There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates.In this respect, the European Commission's Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect. The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again. Anything else would not be sufficient.I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition. This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question.\nPERSON156 : Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing. When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that.Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal L\u00e4nder are currently transposing this directive. In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land. As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal L\u00e4nder are in a similar position.The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out. If Article 13(2) stipulates that 'authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service' then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice. A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped. Will they have language skills? Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them? We very much doubt it. In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this. It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries.I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this. That is a major problem and it is very disappointing.\nPERSON157 : Mr President, in the discussion which is under way, I would like to ask about the effect of the crisis on implementation of the directive in EU countries.In my country, Poland, despite the crisis and difficulties with transposition, it has been possible to draft a law on services which is based on a high degree of liberalisation in registering and running a business. In sectors such as crafts, trade, tourism and hotels, the restrictions are only exceptions. We are doing this in the name of equal opportunities and protection of the principle of healthy competition.The compromise of 2006 assumed that certain areas would be excluded from regulation of the directive. I would like to ask what the evaluation of those decisions looks like today. It was assumed then that in the future, further legislative work would be undertaken on the question of public utility services. Keeping to the metaphor used by the Commissioner, after filling the glass which is already half-full, will there be another, and what will happen next?\nPERSON158 : Mr President, in the compromise reached in 2006, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament withdrew demands for social considerations to be given priority over the freedom of companies that provide services. Otherwise, as Mr Harbour wrote in a press release, it would not have been a compromise. The term 'country of origin principle' has been deleted, but it has been replaced by a conflict of laws regulation from the Commission that clearly states that, in the event of a conflict between the labour market laws of different Member States, the law of the country of origin of the company shall apply.The directive could have been interpreted as meaning that the EU would not interfere in national labour law. However, the Commission quickly drew up guidelines stating that companies providing services do not need to have a permanent representative in the country in which the work is carried out, and therefore the trade union has no counterpart with which to negotiate. The Vaxholm ruling also clearly stated that Swedish labour law is subordinate to EC law, which meant that Sweden was forced to reduce the standard of its labour law legislation. I, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, can see no alternative for workers rights other than for us to provide a clear legal protocol in the treaty in which union rights take precedence over market freedoms.\nPERSON159 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, the Services Directive represents the end of a journey for Europe, a journey of which the final destination is precisely the completion of the internal market so as to facilitate trade within the European Union, and to thus enable the authorities to coordinate their efforts and, above all, to minimise the transaction costs between the different operations within the different sectors and the different Member States.Harmonising the contents of the various administrative procedures and making it easier for service providers to operate in other Member States automatically means increasing growth and therefore also stimulating growth in a period of exceptional crisis such as this. The Services Directive, adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council on 12 December 2006, is an intrinsic part of the Lisbon Strategy, which has been revised over time and adapted to the various situations that Europe has experienced over the last nine years, and its main objective absolutely must be to make the European economy the world's most competitive economy, but also a knowledge-based economy.The economic crisis that we are going through and that the European Union is tackling at institutional level, skilfully reconciling the various measures taken with the individual Member States too, requires the Services Directive to be applied even more correctly and more swiftly than was necessary when it was first adopted. The deadline of 28 December 2009 for the transposition of the Services Directive is therefore not only an indication of the date set for moving on, of course, from the ratification to the legislative process of this directive, but also, and above all, it represents an important step towards a Europe that is increasingly aware of its resources and, more specifically, that is increasingly capable of getting the best out of those resources.\nPERSON160 : (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition.I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope. Notions such as 'support for persons in need' and 'mandated providers' seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive.The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected.I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws. These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services.\nPERSON161 : (PL) Mr President, proper implementation of the Directive on services in the internal market is important not only for European entrepreneurs operating in that market, but also for consumers. The Services Directive is a good example. A period of three years has been allowed for its implementation. That is a long time, but even so, not all countries will manage to transpose the directive within the three years. This example shows most conspicuously that ideal cooperation between Member States and European institutions is needed in order to achieve transposition in time in all Member States.Indeed, this is the direction taken in the recommendations issued by the Commission in June this year concerning means for improving the functioning of the internal market. I think that in the implementation process, it is necessary to go a little further. Therefore, in the report concerning the table of results for the internal market, I propose the initiative of organising a forum for the internal market, which would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition, so that we will be able to apply and execute legislation on the internal market, including this extremely important directive. I would like the forum to be a place for the exchange of experience of Member States and EU institutions in the area of transposition. I would like the forum to draw the attention of society to questions concerning the internal market. We must increase our citizens' interest in the functioning of and responsibility for the market. Then we will have achieved complete success.In connection with the problems which we heard about a moment ago concerning transposition of the Services Directive, I would like to ask if Member States have sought to cooperate with the Commission, and if it can be said that in the implementation process, they have succeeded in applying any of the Commission's recommendations? Does the Commission continue to seek new solutions? Is it making use of all possibilities and means to mobilise and support especially those countries which are experiencing problems with transposition? Are there any new ideas on this matter?\nPERSON162 : (MT) It is worrying that our regular contacts with the local authorities, at least in my country, confirm that many of them are still in the dark as to what awaits them once this directive enters into force. Generally speaking, there is little knowledge as regards the current laws on the four freedoms. There also appears to be a lack of information on anything related to the laws and regulations on financial services, e-communication services and transport services. Furthermore, it seems that the authorities might have problems in simplifying the administrative process and harmonising trade and other licensing regulations. Therefore, the Commission needs to adopt further initiatives so as to provide immediate and direct assistance to local and regional authorities. Moreover, if we really want the implementation process to fully reflect what we agreed upon within Parliament, then it is imperative that the European Parliament remains involved in the process, even after the directive enters into force.\nPERSON163 : (PL) Mr President, in conditions of recession we should, as a rule, strive to create new jobs, increase competitiveness, foster price reductions, or, to put it succinctly, increase benefits to the consumer. We are doing this, for example, by subsidising the motor industry. We are talking about such occupations as hairdressers, plumbers and bricklayers, who do not need subsidies. They do need, however, freedom to do their work. Regulations and reality - if only they were in agreement.I know of the example of a bakery built in a neighbouring country. While it was a question of consent to build it, everything was alright. However, when production started, the government and the local authorities withdrew their consent. Why? The association of local bakers protested. If only this type of practice were never employed.Commissioner, let us agree also to name the 50% of Member States which do implement the legislation. Which ones are they? I would also like to ask that we receive in January a proposal for precise monitoring of the transposition of this directive in individual Member States.\nPERSON164 : (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the Commissioner that the Services Directive is one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in recent years, and that its proper implementation is extremely important.In the previous parliamentary term, I had the opportunity to work on the provisions of the Services Directive. I still remember the huge effort made by all of us here in the European Parliament in drawing up its provisions. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Services Directive and am deeply convinced - and this is something I often stress in meetings with entrepreneurs - that it represents a huge opportunity both for them, and also for the entire economy of Europe.However, it will be possible to transform the opportunity into specific results only if the appropriate legislation is implemented by Member States appropriately and on time. Therefore, I am joining the appeal for acceleration of the implementation process by national authorities which still have not completed essential work in this area, in particular, on the question of proper implementation of the principle of freedom to offer services and of individual contact points. I follow carefully implementation of the Services Directive in individual countries, as I do also in my own country of Poland, where work on suitable implementation of the directive's provisions is still under way. I hope the outcome of these efforts will be satisfactory.\nPERSON165 : (SV) Mr President, the Nordic labour market model is based on agreements between the social partners. This type of model does not work if one of the partners, in this case, a service provider, does not have a representative in place with whom negotiations can be carried out. We were therefore very pleased with the decision taken on the Services Directive, which we believe means that the right to negotiate, enter into and apply collective agreements, and to take industrial action in accordance with national legislation and practice, would not be affected.Nevertheless, during the implementation of the Services Directive in Sweden, a debate arose as to whether or not it is permissible to lay down a requirement for there to be a competent representative of the company. Thus, my question is: does the directive in any way prevent the host country laying down the requirement for the services company to have a representative in place with the mandate to negotiate and enter into agreements?\nPERSON166 : (PT) In the course of this debate, we must not forget the serious implications that transposition of this directive on the liberalisation of services will have in a number of countries, particularly those with highly unstable social situations, further worsening a crisis situation like the one we are experiencing. Even with all the concern shown in the various Member States, unless immediate measures are taken to defend social and workers' rights and to protect the most fragile sectors, including in public service areas, we could have even more serious problems. Liberalisation could increase unemployment, poverty and inequalities among the most vulnerable, and only benefit large service companies and economic groups, particularly in the wealthiest countries.Therefore, at this time of crisis, one vital measure is to postpone transposition of the directive on the liberalisation of services and to conduct an appropriate study of the potential social implications that implementation of this directive would have.\nPERSON167 : Mr President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is to be thanked for highlighting this important issue, the implementation of the Services Directive. In particular, the economic crisis which we are in must not be allowed to be used by countries, entrepreneurs or anybody else to drive us back to protectionism, which would be a disaster in the overall context.On the broader front, trade in services can be the driving force for economic recovery and, indeed, Ireland has prospered since we engaged in foreign trade. The new crisis would be far worse in Ireland if we did not have the broader base to trade internationally, facilitated by the internal market.Indeed, opening up our borders to foreign competition has not brought any negative consequences for domestic services. It has, in fact, fostered competition and innovation. So, what has been proposed today is something I support 100%.Finally, I would just like to say that it was good to hear somebody here say something good about the Irish Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, who is a friend of mine although he is from a different political grouping.\nPERSON168 : (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we are talking about the Services Directive. The aim of this directive was to put into practice the fourth fundamental freedom of the European integration project, since we are today talking of anniversaries. It was adopted three years ago, and now the period given to the Member States in which to adapt their national laws and remove obstacles has come to an end. Now that this period has passed, it is time to assess what state we are now in, who has transposed the legislation and who has not, and under what conditions.My question, however, is whether the Commission considers that a greater level of harmonisation is required and, if so, whether it is thinking of proposing any legislative initiative in relation to this extremely important Services Directive, seeking to harmonise the market and the rights of consumers, citizens and workers.\nPERSON169 : President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you again for raising this very important issue. I think there is general agreement that the Services Directive is very important and that it is really urgent that we try to implement it as soon as possible.The Swedish Presidency is doing its utmost, as have earlier presidencies, to make sure that this goes smoothly and quickly. We have had several discussions in different Council formations. We have had seminars and discussions on it, and it has been placed on the agenda to encourage real progress on this issue.However, almost two months remain, and the answer to the question of who is lagging behind may change. There is still time. Our aim is clear - and I know that it is the Commission's aim as well - and it is that all countries should have implemented the directive by 28 December 2009. There might be some delays. We deplore that, of course, but I know that all countries are working as quickly and swiftly as possible.A question was asked about how the contact points would function. Well, they do not exist yet, but the aim is for them to function in a user-friendly and effective way and to contain all the relevant information that is needed, both by the service suppliers and by consumers. Member States have collaborated with the Commission to supply an information leaflet, available in all languages, to facilitate access for citizens and consumers to the relevant information. Many Member States are also making their own efforts in order to spread information about the directive. There is also an agreement to have a common logo to make it easier for users to navigate between the different websites and the contact points.Some Member States - although it is not compulsory - will provide information on working rights and labour laws at their contact points. The Services Directive does not cover labour law and the posting of workers is excluded from it. The question put to me by my Swedish colleagues is a Swedish issue. We are looking into that, and it is a little outside this debate. We will be happy to come back to it in a more national context.The Services Directive is important. It will make life easier for service providers, it will facilitate free movement and will be beneficial for investment, for growth and jobs and it will be very good for the citizens. The citizens look to us to ensure that it is in place as soon as possible because it will facilitate their life. It is our responsibility to make sure that we do our utmost to see this happen.I would like to thank Parliament again, not only for its contribution in voting on and adopting the Services Directive, but also for acting as a watchdog and continuing to push the Council and the Commission to do what we can in order for it to come into place. But there is still some time remaining and possibly we will come back to this debate next year, under the Spanish Presidency. The Commission will still be watching this very closely.\nPERSON170 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as has been said before, we have discussed all the questions surrounding all the different social and other aspects of this directive. I do not think we should reopen this discussion now, but we do have to look to the Member States to see how they have implemented or will implement the directive. On the basis of the already available information, it does seem that a majority of Member States will have completed the implementation either by the end of the year or maybe the beginning of 2010.So I think one can also say that most Member States will at least have set up the basic single contact point and will therefore be ready to comply with their administrative cooperation agreements and obligations.In some cases, however, there might be delays as far as the changes in the legal framework are concerned.With regard to the review process, some Member States have taken the opportunity of the review to simplify laws and procedures and have made a considerable number of changes. Other Member States have enacted only a few amendments, and the number of changes made of course depends on several factors including the existing regulatory framework and also the internal organisation of Member States: in federal states, it is more complicated than for others.Of course, this also depends on the willingness of a Member State to simplify laws and procedures.With regard to the question of proper implementation, my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, has, on many occasions, drawn the attention of members of the Member States' governments to the importance of the work on implementation, and he and his staff have followed and monitored the implementation process very closely.Indeed, as I said before, during the last three years, more than 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held, and expert groups met in Brussels over 30 times. So we have been very active on that. And we will continue to follow Member States' work and will also continue to provide technical assistance if desired by the Member States. But in the end, it is also clearly the Member States' responsibility to do the work and also allocate the necessary resources.As regards next year, I think it will be crucial to ensure that the process of mutual evaluation provided for in the directive is used in a constructive way. We will also have to assess the quality of implementation of the legislation, as was asked, monitor the functioning of the single contact points and then also get feedback from businesses and from consumers.Last but not least, we may also need to resort to other enforcement mechanisms - sometimes maybe to infringement cases, but it is too early now to say that.On the small and medium-sized enterprises, of course, we are of the same opinion as you. They are the backbone of the EU economy and their concerns are at the heart of the Services Directive.So this directive will benefit all businesses, but SMEs will benefit most, and at the present time, SMEs very often decide to stay at home because of all the legal complexities and also because of the absence of transparent information. Therefore, the Services Directive will do away with many of these complexities and - we all think - give a boost to them.To the Commission's knowledge, no Member State is using the implementation of the Services Directive to reduce workers' rights. I would like to say that very clearly. Workers' rights as such are not affected or dealt with by the Services Directive. Indeed, this was clearly a result of the practical and political compromise reached by both Parliament and the Council.Finally, I would like to reiterate that Parliament has been a key partner throughout the history of the Services Directive. Over the past three years, the Commission has found it important to keep you involved in the implementation process and informed about our work with the Member States and, as was mentioned earlier, this will remain a key action to making the internal market work better, to deliver the growth and jobs we need. Proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue, especially in the current difficult economic crisis.\nPERSON171 : That concludes the item.Written statements (Rule 149)\nPERSON172 : Europe must be competitive. Thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, the Services Directive will help implement the hitherto not entirely regulated free movement of services within the European Union's internal market. The Services Directive regulates licensing procedures, indicating prohibited requirements, and confirms that from 2010, all new requirements for service providers must be non-discriminatory, justified by important social interests; it also regulates the principal functions of the point of contact being established. Most importantly, the costs of service provision are reduced at interstate level, and this is particularly important in this period of economic recession. Lithuania is joining the list of Member States that are ready to implement the provisions of the Services Directive on time. Indeed, it is very important for the Commission to cooperate closely and effectively with the Member States, as in some countries, there is a lack of information and insufficient levels of preparedness for the implementation of the directive. At present, only 50% of the Member States are ready to transpose the provisions of the Services Directive into national legislation.\nPERSON173 : Mr President, Member States must fully implement the Services Directive by 28 December 2009, which would, as in the case of goods and products, open up the services market to private individuals and companies.This directive would help small and medium-sized enterprises to a large extent and promote job creation and economic growth, while taking consumers' interests into account. However, some Member States have decided to restrict employment for citizens from new Member States which joined in 2004 and 2007. Germany and Austria wish to maintain this restriction until 2011, without any more serious economic and social motive. France and Belgium are applying a similar regulation with regard to Romania and Bulgaria.However, by now it is clear that the fears personified by the notorious 'Polish plumber' are groundless. The number of Central and East Europeans working in France is far less, for instance, than the number employed in the UK, even though the decision was made by Paris three years ago to gradually remove the restrictions in those professions where there was a labour shortage.These measures are hindering, to a large extent, the implementation of the Services Directive, one of the basic pillars of which is the complete removal of discrimination on economic and nationality grounds. Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, which swept away the borders between East and West, we can say that the Services Directive also serves a similar aim. The successful implementation of this directive would finally do away with the false image that has been promoted of the 'Polish plumber'.\nPERSON992 : Before any implementation of the directive, the European Parliament should carry out a counter-assessment of the human and social impact of its application by taking account, in particular, of the consequences of the crisis that we are going through. Indeed, everything points to the fact that this directive will result in the European Union's businesses, craftspeople and employees being pitted against one another. Recently, a professional agricultural organisation revealed that the French authorities were proposing that it set up, in the countries of Eastern Europe, employment agencies for agricultural workers who are lower paid and less socially protected than French workers. The transposition of the Services Directive must not lead to the introduction of such practices, which lead to the levelling down of social Europe. Furthermore, we are very concerned about the threats hanging over the services of general interest (SGI) due to the case law of the European Court of Justice. We therefore continue to hope for another European legislative framework that will optimise and develop public services in particular.\nPERSON991 : The Services Directive (2006/123/EC) is characterised by partial liberalisation of the flow of services in the European Union. The objective of bringing such a directive into effect was to release economic potential. The directive has opened up many possibilities, both for consumers and for entrepreneurs. Greater use of the single market has become possible. The main beneficiaries of liberalisation of the market for services include small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the previously existing barriers had caused the greatest difficulties. According to the European Commission, around 70% of the GDP of EU Member States is generated from services. A similar figure is given for the proportion of the workforce engaged in service provision. One of the advantages of bringing the directive into force is the resultant rise in competitiveness in the internal market. Application of this directive has proved to be an opportunity for development of the European economy and has allowed jobs to be created. It should be added that this has achieved one of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, concerning a rise in the competitiveness of the European economy. In addition, it has brought about an increase in the range of services being offered. The effects which have been achieved are an encouragement to continue work on the further liberalisation of this directive."

"transcript": "PERSON197 : The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance in accordance with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure.\nPERSON198 : (RO) I wish to draw your attention to the political situation in Romania and to the impact this is having on Romania's relations with the Community's institutions.In October 2009, the Social Democratic Party quit the government. The newly created opposition brought down the government with a motion of censure, rejected the first new government proposed and refused to take part in negotiations on the formation of a government. As a result, Romania cannot fulfil the obligations it has to the European Commission, the World Bank and the IMF, in terms of the credit it has borrowed. This is the reason why we are in the situation where some of the commitments undertaken with regard to reforming the state cannot be fulfilled in time.The political instability in Romania was mainly triggered by the political actions of the Social Democratic Party. The reasons behind this are not only electoral. The aim in the medium term is to halt the reforms concerning administration, the rule of law, justice and anti-corruption.\nPERSON199 : (PT) Last month, the regions of Europe were in the spotlight. The European Week of Regions and Cities consolidated the position of the regions as a fundamental part of the solution in the European response to global challenges. Such was the conclusion of President Barroso, Commissioner Samecki and the hundreds of debates that took place, leaving no room for doubt.In more specific terms, holding the important meeting of the Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions of Europe, which saw Members of the European Parliament attend for the first time, also represented a milestone in regional policy in favour of European integration. Global challenges and European responses represent a perfect opportunity for a new strategy for the outermost regions. These regions, such as the Azores, beyond the permanent difficulties that we are all used to hearing about, offer a range of possibilities that provide clear opportunities for us to make progress and to give Europe a distinct advantage in new areas that are vital to our responses to global challenges.The President of the Commission therefore needs to put a definitive end to the palace coup that the Commission's 'non-paper' suggests was being prepared while we, MEPs and European citizens, were supporting ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and its importance in defending territorial cohesion ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON200 : Madam President, EUR 465 million has been allocated to the LEADER funding programme in Ireland for the period 2007 to 2013. However, just two years into the five-year programme, only 18% of project funding has been spent because the local development companies who manage the projects have found themselves caught up in red tape and excessive bureaucracy.There are reams of pages of rules, accompanied by an extensive inspection procedure. Part of the problem is that interpretation of the myriad rules can vary from one inspector to another. The other part of the problem is that some of the rules are mindless in the first place. One project worker said that he spent 50% of his time recording what he was doing in the other 50%.Of course we need accountability, but it has reached a stage where there is now a disincentive for local groups to apply for funding. Millions will go unspent, which would be criminal given the need to kick-start our economies with whatever funding is available. We need common sense in Dublin, and we need to ensure that the European Commission ensures that this happens.\nPERSON201 : (FR) Madam President, President V\u00e1clav Havel's speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings.We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame. Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free. Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples.However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent?The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive.Let us knock down the walls of fortress Europe, let us build bridges, not walls ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON202 : (CS) Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we view some of the events taking place in the world today with greater sensitivity. Today we are quite able to make a realistic assessment of events in Russia. In earlier times, we experienced any events in Soviet Union as ideological pressure but now we discuss trade under conditions of absolute individual freedom. With the approach of winter, there is mounting anxiety, of course, over what will happen with supplies of gas from Russia via Ukraine. Studies of the January crisis clearly show how different the situation was in the western and eastern parts of Europe. They will lead to a more careful approach to the preparation of crisis scenarios. It is important to find the best possible solution to contractual relationships at the international level and, at the same time, to provide more information in situations of this kind. The high costs of technical measures also oblige us to consider carefully whether to finance them from the public purse or on the basis of European directives. The question is how much gas we actually need to store and how to finance it. It is important to distinguish between a real crisis and a business matter in relation to gas and at what point senior political figures should enter the negotiations and what the market should control. We must avoid being drawn into excessive bureaucratic interference.\nPERSON203 : Madam President, today the EU Commission is demanding of the Irish Government savage cuts in Ireland's budget, involving the slashing of public services and the living standards of working people, possibly even for pensioners and the unemployed.The Commission should know, however, that it is conspiring with the Irish Government in a lie to pretend that the money given to bail out the banks is not State aid while, at the same time, hammering the public sector.However, Irish workers and community activists are fighting back. Tens of thousands marched in protest last Friday; thousands of workers marched in Dublin today; and on 24 November, a public sector workers' strike is scheduled, in order to stop these attacks.In view of the seriousness of the situation, that should now be upgraded to a 24-hour general strike to bring down this appalling government, which has no mandate for these policies, and to halt the policy of the Commission and of the Irish Government to slash and burn the living standards and services of working people.\nPERSON204 : Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly's attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK. This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years. This was the case until the EU got itself involved. As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business.But it gets worse. While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death.This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out.\nPERSON205 : (RO) The President of the Atra Kadisha World Organisation, Grand Rabbi David Schmidl, asked me to be, and I quote, 'their spokesman in the European Union' where they would like a committee to be set up to deal with any complaints concerning the desecration of the grounds in cemeteries. The Geneva Treaty should also be updated and improved.I do not wish to give specific examples and make accusations against anyone, but I have seen with my own eyes photographs depicting Jewish cemeteries where horses and cattle graze on graves. I have also seen images of tombstones turned into basic toilets, as well as old Jewish catacombs dating back 2 000 years where the sacred human remains are in an appalling state. The remaining cemeteries have been invaded by bulldozers with excavators digging up relics.This is a great affront to God. The Holocaust is a tragic scar on the face of mankind and it must never be repeated, not even on a miniature scale. I myself made a pilgrimage to Auschwitz with my children and believe me, I know very well what I am talking about.These people are asking us in the European Parliament to defend all vestiges of all religions, not only Jewish vestiges, but also Romanian vestiges in Europe.(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON206 : (HU) Madam President, our dear neighbours, the Austrians, have been polluting one of Hungary's most beautiful rivers, the R\u00e1ba, for years. Two weeks ago, we could see a layer of foam half a metre thick on the river, clearly highlighting this fact. However, not content with polluting our river, our dear neighbours now want to pollute our air as well with the incinerator planned for construction in Heiligenkreuz. They want to build an incinerator in Heiligenkreuz 300 metres from the Hungarian border, which could incinerate almost ten times the volume of refuse produced in Burgenland annually, and all of this with the European Union's assistance. This planned investment infringes Directive 2008/98/EC. This is why I am calling on the European Commission not to approve any EU assistance for the construction of the incinerator in Heiligenkreuz.\nPERSON207 : (EL) Madam President, the major challenge facing mankind in terms of climate change is how we can stop building up more carbon in the atmosphere and start storing it in the ground.Given that it is impossible for us to stop emitting carbon gases over the next 50 years, increasing carbon storage in the ground is our only hope and should be the priority of policies to combat this problem. In order to achieve this, we need to increase plant cover. As part of this effort, China has planted 54 million hectares of trees, with impressive repercussions on the availability of drinking water and agricultural productivity. Similarly, tree-planting programmes in Rwanda have resulted in such an increase in the flow of rivers towards the capital that it can now be powered solely by a hydroelectric plant.In the same direction, the US House of Representatives has passed legislation under which the USA will pay USD 5 billion to deal with deforestation.For these reasons, the stand taken by the Council, which not only has failed to commit to a specific amount in financing for developing countries, but also has failed to say anything about financing to maintain the world's forests, is unacceptable at a time when there is no uniform policy or coordination at European Union level on the protection of forest eco-systems at risk in southern Europe.Nonetheless, I trust that the European Union's negotiations in Copenhagen will pro-actively support global efforts to put an end to deforestation and to increase tree-planting.\nPERSON208 : (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate on neurodegenerative diseases permits me to introduce the problem of sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to bring to Parliament's knowledge the fact that 150 people throughout Italy have begun a hunger strike as a show of support for Salvatore Usala, an ALS sufferer who has stopped eating in order to protest against the Italian Government's indifference to the problems experienced by patients and their family members who are living with this terrible disease. This campaign is also being supported by members of the Italian Parliament, such as Antonietta Farina, and by our colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Rinaldi.Above all, however, this is a struggle that ALS patients and their families face every day, in a dignified and quiet way, as part of the tragedy of having a terrible disease. ALS affects young people but there is no cure for it; and yet, the Italian state is very attentive to everything bar patients and their families. Carrying out research is a challenge for Europe but it is up to the Member States to guarantee patients a dignified existence.\nPERSON209 : (FR) Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine.Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you.Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits? At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths - nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case.With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants. I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene.The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype. I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required.\nPERSON210 : (PL) Madam President, the scandalous judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which orders a cross to be removed from the wall of an Italian school and EUR 5 000 compensation to be paid to one of its pupils for so-called moral damages, has aroused concern not only in Italy, but also in other countries of the European Union. The cross is a symbol both of the Christian religion and of the history and tradition of Europe. Removal of the cross by administrators is the first step to the cultural 'harakiri' of Europe.Unfortunately, pragmatism of this kind is turning into a consistent plan to combat European values. It is only necessary to recall the removal of references to Christianity in the most important documents of the European Union. We need to return to the original ideas and concepts of the founding fathers of the European Union, who were Christian democrats. Therefore, I appeal to the President of the European Parliament to organise a suitable debate, which will end with a resolution on the subject of the freedom of religious practice in Europe and on the fundamental values on which the European Union is based.\nPERSON211 : (PT) In Portugal, and particularly in the north, the economic and social crisis is getting worse and unemployment continues to rise, making this region one of the poorest in the European Union, as recent Eurostat documents show. Large companies continue to announce that they are scaling back their activities and cutting jobs. One of the most serious examples is that of Qimonda, in Vila do Conde, which is in the process of making 600 workers redundant, in addition to around 1 000 that were already made redundant last year. This effectively represents the destruction of one of the largest and most important companies in a strategic industrial sector for technological development.We cannot accept this situation. It is unacceptable that neither the European Commission nor the Council has found an alternative to the dismantling of this microchip and nanotechnology industry. It is appalling that they remain apathetic in the face of the worsening unemployment and increasing suffering in vast regions of the European Union.\nPERSON212 : Madam President, I was due to talk about the pressures unlimited EU migration is putting on the UK. Forgive me for raising a pressing matter recently brought to my attention. As a coordinator on the Regional Development Committee and an MEP for Wales, it was with great concern that I received a leaked copy of a draft communication of the European Commission entitled A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe: reforming the budget, changing Europe.The document proposes a major refocusing of the EU's spending priorities, placing greater emphasis on - and I paraphrase - a global Europe, and less on agriculture and transfers towards well-off regions. This will have a huge impact on British agriculture and structural fund programmes in this current cycle. As a net contributor, the United Kingdom will be forced to give up much more of the rebate, whilst other countries will be the main beneficiaries.11.8% of funds earmarked for the UK under the cohesion policy go to the poorest regions in Wales. I am very concerned that this leaked document may have consequences for transitional payments at the end of the current programme in 2013. It is time the people of the UK had a referendum on its relationship with this place so they can be the people who decide their destiny, not unelected bureaucrats.\nPERSON213 : (HU) As we celebrate here in the European Union so enthusiastically the collapse of the Berlin Wall and Communism with it, we might well ask what has become of the former Communist leaders. I will tell you. They are the ones who have become the most enthusiastic capitalists, neo-liberals and champions of the order of world domination. On their return to power, they have done away with everything that was good in Communism - and let us admit it, there were a few things - such as security of employment and social security. However, they have brought back the most hideous aspects, brutality and terror.On the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution, which had made possible the collapse of the Berlin Wall, people were shot in the eye. At the moment in Hungary, as we speak in the Chamber and celebrate the collapse of Communism, these Communist comrades are holding 16 political prisoners in detention.I will only celebrate when the political prisoners have been released, when the victims shot in the eye have received justice and when these Communists end this bloodshed and are consigned to the dustbin of history.\nPERSON214 : (PL) Madam President, I would like to speak about the proposition for reform of the European Union budget after 2013. Is it true that this proposition means a substantial reduction in regional funds? Does the European Commission realise that this will radically weaken EU regional and agricultural policy?The proposition to weaken poorer regions of the EU in order to fund the battle against climate change may hardly be called rational or logical. It would affect the majority of the EU's 271 regions. It is surely possible to help poor regions of the EU while, at the same time, using good projects to tackle climate change, reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy and modern technological solutions.Does the Commission intend, when introducing the proposition for budget reform, to by-pass regional and local authorities in the distribution of funds? In this way, recognition is being taken away from territorial authorities in matters which are of great significance for them.\nPERSON215 : (LT) The European Union has committed itself to establishing an effective mechanism to prevent child sex abuse. Eight months have passed since this particularly important topic was discussed in a plenary session of the European Parliament. We should welcome the fact that since then, the Council has begun to debate a draft directive that aims to improve the legislation in this area. However, time does not stand still and now and again painful events remind us that there is still insufficient protection for our children. Sadly, the consequences of these crimes are devastating and long-lasting. The sexual exploitation of children and the dissemination of pornography are often transnational in nature, and can therefore only be effectively prevented with international cooperation. We must plan for criminal responsibility of new forms of child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse that are not envisaged in current legislation. I would like to draw the attention of the new Parliament to this important problem and call on the Council to speed up the discussion of the draft proposals.\nPERSON216 : (SL) Madam President, I am pleased with the progress in relations between the governments of Croatia and Slovenia, which have taken a major political step forward, and with the increase in maturity which both governments have exhibited. The border arbitration agreement which they have signed sends out a positive message and sets an excellent example to the other countries in the region.However, I note with regret that, only a few days after signing this agreement, the Prime Minister of Croatia also signed a unilateral statement which places a one-sided interpretation on the recently signed agreement. We should not do anything which sows the seeds of doubt or spreads uncertainty, because that is not the way to move forward. Unilateral statements and unilateral actions are never a good choice, nor do they send out the right message. Such action does not promote credibility, it does not encourage the necessary mutual trust and it raises doubts about the seriousness of our intentions and the reality and viability of the agreement. If we are to succeed on this front, we need to make major efforts and strengthen trust amongst ourselves at home, amongst our neighbours and throughout the region.I call on the government of Croatia to refrain from fresh unilateral actions and I ask the Prime Minister to show political courage and determination instead and to help us overcome the impasses of the past.\nPERSON217 : (PL) I would like to draw attention to the fact that we were alarmed last week by the situation, or by the information, that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has asked the European Commission to settle the debt owed to Gazprom by Ukraine. In view of this, I would like to ask if such a request has been received. Does the European Commission intend to make the European Union pay this debt? If the answers to the first two questions are affirmative, then on what grounds would the Commission do this?Madam President, I would also like you to note that I am the only Member who has not used all of his speaking time.\nPERSON218 : Madam President, I have asked for the floor today to inform you of a rather disturbing fact that has come to my knowledge whilst on a visit to Washington DC as part of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs delegation.On the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection (SWIFT, PNR), the United States is expanding its National Security Agency data-collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country.How can the US pretend to respect the right to privacy when it is building an enormous eavesdropping agency - and how can we just sit to one side and let that happen?It is our responsibility to raise awareness of this gross abuse of power and violation of our basic rights. I hope you will join me in informing our voters and the citizens in our countries about this through declarations and articles to the press.\nPERSON219 : Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant - despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - and the refusal of the Citizens' Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs.Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process?\nPERSON220 : (PT) The investigation conducted by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work provides some worrying conclusions, stating that generalised unemployment is having negative consequences for the safety and health of workers. According to the study, which involved 27 000 respondents in the 27 Member States, six in every 10 workers feel that the economic crisis and increased unemployment are making working conditions worse. Seventy-five per cent of respondents claimed that the worsening of their health is attributable to the work they do. This information bears out the data from a Eurostat study, which shows that 27 million workers suffer accidents or are affected by occupational diseases and that 137 million workers are exposed to risks on a daily basis. Just this week, yet another serious work-related accident killed five Portuguese workers in Andorra.This situation requires a rapid response from the European Union and the Member States. This response should involve creating jobs with rights, promoting work and workers, and penalising employers that cut back on prevention and protection measures for workers in order to boost their profits.\nPERSON221 : There was confusion there in assigning the microphone. I should have given the floor to Mr Teixeira. I probably pronounced your name wrongly and that caused the confusion.\nPERSON222 : (PT) The European Commission recently tabled a draft communication on budgetary reform, which included references to cohesion policy that are causing anxiety and confusion, especially where the outermost regions are concerned.A debate on the Community budget needs to be held urgently, but we believe that the financial framework after 2013 should be based on solidarity and territorial cohesion, this being vital for regions such as Madeira, which face permanent difficulties and which therefore need permanent support.The intention to alter the focus of cohesion policy from the present regionally based approach to an approach based on value added sectors is unacceptable. Such a change could lead to the abolition of Objective 2, which currently benefits around two thirds of the European regions.It is incomprehensible that the Commission intends to switch the allocation of funds from a regional to a national basis, or even at European level, rejecting the criterion of proximity that has always underpinned cohesion policy. It is unacceptable for a Member State's long-standing membership of the EU to be a variable in the formula for calculating structural fund allocations, dividing up Member States into new and old, which will render Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty meaningless as regards the outermost regions' access to structural funds.\nPERSON223 : (FR) Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission's and Parliament's attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities. These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles.This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off F\u00e9camp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen. A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators. Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer.I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals? Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region? And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies?\nPERSON224 : (PL) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the health situation in Ukraine. Available data shows that over a million cases of influenza have already been reported, including several dozen cases of the AH1N1 virus. Ukraine has requested international aid and, in particular, for vaccines, medicines, disinfectants, masks, gloves and laboratory supplies.We know that the Commission has set in motion a special mechanism for civil aid, a monitoring and information centre to coordinate the aid given to Ukraine by EU countries. What is this coordination like? What aid is being given? How is the monitoring system working? I think that public opinion would like to receive an answer to these questions.\nPERSON225 : (HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two decades have elapsed since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the 20th anniversary of which we have marked, and since the Iron Curtain was torn down. Nevertheless, there has been little to show for these 20 years as we see that in many countries liberated from Communism, we have not yet managed to free ourselves definitively from the habits of the former system.In the autumn of 2006, the police completely disregarded the right to free assembly on Budapest's streets, as well as the right to a fair trial. The victims of this are still looking, in vain, for justice and the opportunity to exercise their rights. In March this year in Budapest, calls for the prime minister to step down were again met with detentions and inhumane, humiliating treatment. It can still happen in the European Union even today that people are not allowed to use their own language in the land of their birth - like in Slovakia, for instance - or exercise the rights granted by democracy, if the fate of a minority has been imposed on them by history. Take also Romania, where they are in the process of putting up a statue to a former general who gave the order to fire among the participants in demonstrations.\nPERSON226 : (PT) The current economic crisis leads to job insecurity. Economic difficulties lead workers to accept, sometimes blindly, job offers that eschew labour laws and the supervision of law enforcement and government authorities. Unfortunately, we have already witnessed in the European Union several cases of exploitation of labour that often genuinely constitute slavery, whether of European citizens, or non-European citizens. Moreover, we have seen an unusually high number of deaths of migrant workers, including many compatriots of mine, many Portuguese citizens, even when legally employed. These accidents have happened in the workplace and especially in the civil construction sector.The European Union and its bodies, as well as all the Member States, are therefore urged and called upon to cooperate forcefully and effectively, so as to prevent these situations.\nPERSON227 : (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to sound the alarm bell regarding the low rate of planning and payment of the ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund appropriations.We are still very far from having planned half of the available funds. With regard to the payments, only 9.62% of the EUR 347 billion for regional policy has been paid to the project leaders. All the countries are affected, some even more so than others. Spain, Luxembourg and Sweden must do their level best to catch up with the countries that are in the lead when it comes to the payment of European funds, such as, for example, the Baltic countries, Ireland and Slovenia.The European Union's regional policy is one of the most useful policies for our fellow citizens. Indeed, it guarantees economic, social and territorial cohesion through the cofinancing of practical, and very often crucial, projects.I therefore appeal to the national management authorities to get involved. At the same time, I feel that it is crucial, in a period of economic crisis, for European rules to be adapted to the major problems.\nPERSON228 : (PL) Madam President, today we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe. There was a very appropriate and worthy ceremony, in which Mr Havel and Mr Buzek took part, and there are exhibitions in the European Parliament. That is how it should be, but the European institutions should not restrict themselves to such events only once in many years.This should be present in our history - the truth about these changes should be present in our educational activities, and it should be initiated by the European institutions. We need a common history textbook of those times, which would show how Europe united, so that the children in our schools can have access to that truth and that knowledge.On the other hand, many examples can be given of money spent unnecessarily. The British organisation Open Europe says that EUR 7 million was spent on financing a blog about a donkey travelling around the Netherlands. It is time we spent money for Europe more effectively.\nPERSON229 : Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid we must conclude the one-minute speeches under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure at this point. According to Rule 150, we can conduct this type of debate for no more than 30 minutes. These speeches have now gone on for almost 40 minutes, because, unfortunately, many speakers did not keep to one minute.I tried to give priority to those who did not have a chance to speak in either of the last two debates and I hope you felt it was fairly balanced. We still have four more debates this evening and, as you know, the sitting must close at midnight at the latest."

"transcript": "PERSON217 : The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Doorn on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\nPERSON218 : rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, this report is about the implementation of the eighth directive on statutory audits of annual accounts. It is a good thing that Parliament is paying closer attention to the implementation and transposal of the legislation we pass here. We in Parliament can decide on the most outstanding rules and regulations, but if those rules and regulations are not implemented and complied with in the Member States, we are wasting our time here.In the transposal of the eighth directive, too, many things have gone wrong. Key definitions are framed differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public oversight is a long way short of 27. The report calls on the Commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies.We also wonder whether the method of harmonisation employed, namely minimum harmonisation, is indeed the right way to attain the uniform application of key concepts. Perhaps we do need to think again whether key definitions of this kind are the way forward or whether a different method of harmonisation - one that is not open to multiple interpretations - needs to be used.Finally, Madam President, the report discusses the Commission's recommendation on the limitation of the civil liability of accountants. Should further measures be necessary in order to achieve convergence in Europe, we shall look forward to the Commission's proposals.The objective must and will remain to aim for the effective and independent auditing of accountants. The economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible.\nPERSON219 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, honourable Members, I would like first to thank Mr Doorn for his report on the application of the directive on statutory audits of accounts. I would like also to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and more particularly Mrs van den Burg, who has contributed to the production of this report.In the context of the financial crisis, it is essential that all Member States who are currently behind should quickly transpose the directive to achieve the objectives set. The Commission continuously monitors the transposition status of the directive in the Member States. A dashboard is regularly published on our website.The results relating to the Member States' performance should clearly improve this spring. Mr Doorn's report has certainly facilitated such an improvement. As your report emphasises, the Commission has already adopted the recommendation on quality assurance and the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors. I thank Parliament for its support for these two initiatives.The recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors is part of a strategy to reduce the concentration in the auditing market. To explore other options along the same lines, a consultation on control structures in audit companies and on their consequences for the auditing market was published in November.The European Parliament is asking the Commission to assess the national laws transposing the directive and to inform it of the effects of the measures taken by the Member States in the wake of the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of auditors. At the appropriate time, we will be happy to prepare these assessments, taking into account all the issues raised in the report by Mr Doorn. This is a commitment from Commissioner McCreevy that I am happy to pass on to you. I thank Mr Doorn and I dare to hope that we will see practical results.\nPERSON221 : The item is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow."

"transcript": "PERSON006 : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to you all. I would like to begin with some comments about the situation regarding the plenary chamber in Strasbourg. As you know, due to the partial collapse of the false ceiling in the plenary chamber in Strasbourg on 7 August, this first part-session of the European Parliament in September has had, exceptionally, to be held here in Brussels. I took this decision with a view to ensuring the greatest possible safety of Members and staff, based on my perusal of the initial expert reports and after consultation with the chairpersons of the groups and the French Council Presidency. The decision also takes account of the need to maintain continuity in the European Parliament's legislative work.The preliminary findings of the investigations indicate that the partial collapse of the false ceiling was caused by fractures in the building components which connect the suspended ceiling with the actual ceiling structure. The investigations are ongoing and are being carried out by several independent international structural engineering firms commissioned by Parliament with a view to establishing further details and responsibilities for the collapse. These investigations are being carried out in very close cooperation with the relevant local authorities as well as with a senior buildings safety expert appointed by the French Government. The apportionment of responsibility and liability between the contractors involved in the construction of the original ceiling will be established on the basis of the final investigation reports, once they are available. The false ceiling in the plenary chamber will now be re-suspended using a new technique which has been approved by the independent experts and the local buildings authorities.Although every effort is being made to complete the work as soon as possible, the procedure involved is, of necessity, somewhat lengthy. Nonetheless, we hope that all the safety investigations and necessary repairs will be completed in time for the House to hold its September II part-session in Strasbourg.May I assure you that safety takes absolute priority in all our considerations and decision-making."

"transcript": "PERSON008 : Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I have some very sad announcements to make. During the summer, we learned with great sadness of the tragic death of our friend and colleague Professor Bronis\u0142aw Geremek. He was a great Polish patriot and a true European who, for decades, campaigned tirelessly for the Polish people to share in the fundamental values of democracy, liberty, human rights and the rule of law. His commitment to the democratic opposition and the great popular movement Solidarno\u015b\u0107 ultimately bore fruit.For almost two decades now, Poland has occupied its rightful place among the free and democratic nations of Europe and, as we all know, has been a member of the European Union since 1 May 2004. His contribution to this achievement undoubtedly made Bronis\u0142aw Geremek - who also served as a member of the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish Parliament, for many years and was his country's Foreign Minister from 1997 to 2000 - one of the founding fathers and chief architects of the new Poland.Bronis\u0142aw Geremek had been a Member of the European Parliament since 2004. We knew him as a man whose belief in the European project was profound and genuine. It embodied his ideals and convictions: reconciliation, dialogue and compromise. I greatly admired his unique ability to be near to his country and near to the European Union at the same time. He worked tirelessly for the integration process, which he regarded as the best solution for the future of his country and, indeed, for our continent as a whole.We have lost an exceptional figure from the European scene, a colleague whose tragic and untimely death has left a vacuum which will be hard to fill. I wish to express my deepest condolences to his family - especially his two sons - and all his friends. We in the European Parliament will always honour his memory.Ladies and gentlemen, we also heard with great sorrow, in early August, of the death of our colleague Willi Piecyk shortly before his 60th birthday. On this sad occasion too, I would like to speak for the European Parliament in expressing our deepest sympathy to his family and friends. Willy Piecyk had been a Member of the European Parliament since 1992. He was a leading figure in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where he served as spokesman for the Socialist Group for many years.Only a few weeks ago, he was able to join us to celebrate the first European Maritime Day. At the time, although I was aware of his serious illness, it seemed to me that his health was improving. Sadly, this impression was mistaken.Willi Piecyk will remain in our memories in many ways as the initiator of many important projects. With his passing, we have lost a colleague who enjoyed the respect and appreciation of everyone in this House. We will remember Willi Piecyk, too, with lasting gratitude.Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I must also inform you about the death of a much-loved former colleague, Maria Luisa Cassanmagnago Cerretti, who died on 4 August. I have particularly vivid memories of her, for she joined the European Parliament at the same time as I did, in 1979, when she took up the cause of Europe and European integration in this House. She served as a Vice-Chairwoman of the Group of the European People's Party and was Vice-President of the European Parliament from 1982 to 1987. Her other political functions included chairing the Political Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the forerunner of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for a time.Through her political commitment, Maria Luisa Cassanmagnago Cerretti was an inspiration, particularly for women, and as a Member of the European Parliament, she was a woman of intellectual courage and compassion who made a valuable contribution to European integration. We will remember her with great fondness. Ladies and gentlemen, during the summer recess, a series of tragic air disasters occurred. On 20 August, Spain's worst air disaster for 25 years left 154 people dead. Only 18 of the 172 people on board the aircraft, which was en route from Madrid's Barajas Airport to the Canary Islands, survived the tragedy. The day after the crash, I made a statement on behalf of the European Parliament, and today I would like to reiterate that message of solidarity and support to the families and friends of the deceased.Just a few days after the Madrid tragedy, on 24 August, another plane crashed shortly after take-off at Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek, killing 68 of the passengers and crew. I would like to speak for everyone in this House in expressing our most heartfelt condolences to the victims of these and other tragic events.I would ask you all to rise for a minute's silence in memory of those who have lost their lives.(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"

"transcript": "PERSON136 : Mr President, yesterday, my colleague, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Barrot, stressed that the aim of the proposals is to communitise the evaluation mechanism and to make it more effective, while maintaining mutual confidence among the Member States.The Commission is convinced that Parliament should be involved in the Schengen evaluation, which is not the case at present. The citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations.However, in accordance with the treaties in force, it is not possible to involve Parliament by way of codecision. The Commission therefore stands by its proposals on the basis of the treaties in force.Nevertheless, once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the matter will be reopened and the Commission will decide, when the time comes, what it considers to be the most appropriate legal basis for the proposed mechanism, and will involve the European Parliament as fully as possible.The Commission could therefore submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation.\nPERSON137 : I appreciate the clarifications given by the European Commission, but would like to remind the House that, as was made clear during the debate, although the Legal Service of the European Parliament recognised the legitimacy of the legal basis of the Commission's initiative, it also said that, based on the Treaty in force, the European Commission could have taken the same initiative based on a legal formula according the European Parliament the power of codecision.As this was not the case, I propose that the initiative should be returned to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs so that the Commission can rethink its initiative. Then, within the term set out in Rule 56 of our Rules of Procedure, we in Parliament can expect to receive an initiative from the Commission that respects codecision and gives this European Parliament the power it deserves to intervene in upholding greater security within the Schengen Area.\nPERSON138 : Thank you, Mr Coelho. There is no need to vote on this request because, once the Commission has decided to maintain its proposal, that proposal is automatically referred back to committee, as Mr Coelho asked."

I would like to extend a warm welcome to the South African delegation which is here to take part in the 14th inter-parliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the South African Parliament. The head of the African delegation, Mrs Joanmariae Louise Fubbs, Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Industry of the National Assembly of South Africa, is accompanied by the Chairman of the Committee on International Relations and five other colleagues from the South African Parliament.As you know, Europe and South Africa share the same values, as far as democracy, human rights and multilateral cooperation is concerned. The Republic of South Africa is not only a regional power but also a rising global power and a valued partner who will help us to solve the challenges of the global financial and economic crisis. We firmly believe that we must deepen our dialogue and develop ever closer relations and cooperation. Our two regions should act together, not only over efforts to find a way out of the current crisis, but also in the creation of a new global order that will be of lasting benefit to us all. Once again then, Mrs Joanmariae Louise Fubbs and esteemed colleagues from the South African Parliament, I welcome you."

"transcript": "PERSON019 : The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.Monday:\nPERSON020 : (FR) Mr President, my speech relates, in fact, to Monday's agenda.The draft agenda that was issued before we received the document on which we have to vote included, I believe, a debate on three cases of parliamentary immunity. These cases of parliamentary immunity are extremely important because they may have a bearing on the freedom of exercise of a Member who is exposed to the political hostility of the government, or to the political hostility of the courts, or to the political hostility of the courts as exploited by the government, via prosecutors.I note that these issues have disappeared from the debate and I find that deeply regrettable. There remains only one vote without debate on a report by Mrs Wallis, concerning the immunity of Mr Siwiec. This vote without debate does not permit speeches and thus does not permit the Member concerned to express himself before his peers, before his fellow Members. I find that deeply regrettable.I will conclude by saying a word about the report by our fellow Member, Mr Speroni, which was adopted by a very large majority - by virtually the whole of this Parliament, I believe - on the attitude of the French authorities, who denied our former fellow Member, Mr Marchiani, the protection of his immunity with regard to phone-tapping, when such immunity is guaranteed to members of national parliaments.I would like to know what has become of the recommendations from Mr Speroni's report and, in particular, of the complaint that we had to lodge with the Court of Justice of the European Communities.\nPERSON021 : There has not been a request for a debate to be held on parliamentary immunity. Therefore, voting will be held on this matter tomorrow. Had there been a request, we could have considered this matter in a different way. There is no discussion on the agenda because of the absence of any kind of motion on this matter.Tuesday:No amendments have been proposed.Wednesday:I have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for an amendment to the title of the draft resolutions on freedom of information in Italy and other Member States of the European Union. The amended title would be: Freedom of information in the European Union.\nPERSON022 : Mr President, a common point that emerged from the debate we had last month on this resolution was that we need to discuss the issue of freedom of expression everywhere, both throughout Europe and outside it. However, we cannot, Mr President, declare a crusade against one individual country. The issue on Italy within this resolution is essentially a national political debate, and we, as the European Parliament, must hold back from intervening in a debate such as this one. If we keep the word Italy within the title of this resolution, we would be assuming the role of some sort of higher court, which we are not, and we would, in fact, be undermining all the authority of and respect towards our institution.We support freedom of expression within Europe and beyond it, and therefore we call upon all those who are truly for freedom of expression everywhere to vote in favour of the change in the resolution's title.\nPERSON023 : Mr President, I should like to support and speak in favour of the motion.Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion.\nPERSON024 : Mr President, this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle. We said clearly beforehand that this started with the Italian case, but we do not want to concentrate on that. We want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in Europe. That is why we chose this title; it is about the case that started in Italy, but it is also about general statements.We should not try and do everything. For weeks, we have tried again and again to put the starting case to one side. At least be honest: if you say we want to defend Berlusconi, whatever he does, that is an honest position, but now you are acting as if you wanted to be neutral, to be objective. Let us stick to this title. That is reasonable.(Applause)\nPERSON026 : (DE) Mr President, one short comment and one request to you, Mr President: on Thursday, we shall be discussing, among other things, the terrible death penalties in Iran, which are totally unacceptable and which are often handed down for so-called crimes which, under our sense of justice, are not even prosecuted.We should take this opportunity to say clearly - and perhaps you should find an opportunity, like the Council, to say that, because we are against violence, we condemn terrorist violence in general, even if it is directed against the government bodies of Iran. I think that our objective position would be stronger if we said clearly that the attack that cost 42 people their lives is not in keeping with our policy. We are against violence, against the death penalty and also against terrorist violence as a matter of principle."

"transcript": "PERSON006 : Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the session, I would like to say a few words. As you know, 10 days ago, the President of Poland, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, signed the Treaty of Lisbon. I am certain we are a step closer to completion of the ratification process. I am also sure that ratification will soon be completed, too, by the Czech Republic.I would like to inform you that this week, on Tuesday at 15.00, our first Question Hour with the President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, will take place. This debate represents a significant institutional change. It will make the European Parliament's work with the Commission significantly better. I have worked on this matter with the Chairs of the political groups and President Barroso, and am pleased that the new procedure will become a permanent feature of plenary sessions in Strasbourg. I am sure that it will make our debates more lively and open up our discussions even further.Ladies and gentlemen, on 10 October, we observed the International Day for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Since 2007, this date has also been European Day against the Death Penalty, when we demonstrate our determination and commitment against this inhumane practice. We also present our position in support of a worldwide moratorium in accordance with the declaration of Parliament made in a resolution in 2007, and the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.In a press release on 9 October, I stressed, in my own name and on behalf of the European Parliament, our commitment to creating a Europe without capital punishment, and also for its abolition everywhere in the world. This is our common obligation. Unfortunately, there is still one country in Europe where the death penalty is pronounced and carried out. That country is Belarus. We condemn the carrying out of executions in Iran, and we express particular fears for Iranians who have been sentenced to death following the demonstrations which accompanied the presidential election in June. Above all, we oppose the handing down of death sentences to juveniles, and would like to point out that this year marks the 20th anniversary of adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which explicitly forbids the execution of minors.We must continue to oppose capital punishment resolutely, and to speak out about instances of its use everywhere in the world. We are disturbed by recent events in China, where 12 people have been sentenced to death following the ethnic disturbances and violence in Urumchi in Xinjiang Province. Despite the serious crimes which were committed during the disturbances in June, we call upon the Chinese authorities to maintain the standards of honest trial proceedings. We are also disturbed by cases of the pronouncement and carrying out of the death penalty in the United States, especially in the State of Ohio, where, after several unsuccessful attempts, executions by lethal injection have been postponed.I would like to reiterate our appeal to every country still applying the death penalty to abolish it from its criminal code or establish, pending its abolition, a moratorium on the pronouncement and carrying out of death sentences.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON110 : The next item is the joint debate on:the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0015/2009 -,the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0012/2009 -,the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Barbados on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0017/2009 -,the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0013/2009 -,the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0016/2009 -,the report by Mr Busuttil, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Commonwealth of The Bahamas on the short-stay visa waiver - C7-0014/2009 -.\nPERSON111 : Despite the cold being felt inside this chamber, this topic will deal with countries boasting far warmer temperatures, which is rather more ideal. These reports, in fact, consist of an agreement which provides for a short stay visa waiver between the European Union and its citizens and the citizens of six different countries - The Republic of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas as well as Antigua and Barbuda.This waiver applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa, that is, when citizens from these countries travel to the European Union. It is valid for a maximum stay of three months within a six month period. This waiver covers all categories of persons, meaning ordinary citizens as well as diplomats travelling for various reasons. This applies particularly to the numerous tourists who are European Union citizens and who go on holiday to these six countries, and thus we will be greatly facilitating things for them.This agreement however, specifically excludes those who travel for work and remuneration purposes. In these reports, we have included a provision that says that each of these third countries can suspend or terminate this agreement with regard to all countries of the European Union rather than excluding individual countries. This was done in order to safeguard a level playing field for of all European Union citizens and, beyond that, as an expression of solidarity. On the other hand, the European Union will do the same, meaning that the European Community can also suspend or terminate an agreement on behalf of all its Member States. The European Union or any of these countries can either suspend the whole agreement or parts of it, on grounds of public interest, protection of national security, public health protection, illegal immigration or in the case of a country's re-introduction of a visa obligation. Above all, I would like to clarify, Madam President, that before taking a vote on these reports at committee level, we asked for and were given a guarantee on the part of the European Commission that full reciprocity would be ensured. This was an essential principle for us; full reciprocity assured by these countries in the removal of their visa requirement whilst we would do the same in turn. Thus, we would be eliminating visa requirements on both sides. This agreement has been achieved in the requisite manner and once again clearly demonstrates how the European Union is capable of negotiating with one voice on an international level and by showing solidarity towards all countries. I will conclude by saying that once more, this illustrates the European Union's capacity to open its doors to citizens worldwide.\nPERSON112 : Madam President, I am also very grateful to Mr Busuttil for his excellent report.The six non-EU countries - Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles - were transferred from the negative list to the positive list of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 pursuant to a new regulation, Regulation (EC) No 1932/2006, adopted on 21 December 2006, which confirmed that these countries fulfilled the criteria laid down in the regulation.This regulation governed the implementation of the visa waiver for nationals of these countries upon the conclusion and the entry into force of a bilateral visa waiver agreement between the European Community and each of these countries.As Mr Busuttil said, it was important to ensure full reciprocity, since back then, some of these countries were still imposing the visa requirement on citizens of one or more Member States.Due to the temporary visa regime applied by the CARICOM - the Caribbean common market - countries to nationals of several Member States during the Cricket World Cup, formal negotiations on the visa waiver only began in July 2008.To ensure that citizens benefit from the visa waiver as soon as possible, the Commission proposed the temporary application of the agreements signed on 28 May 2009 and, since then, they have been applied temporarily pending completion of the procedures necessary for their formal conclusion.Under the principle of reciprocity, the visa waiver covers all categories of persons - ordinary, diplomatic or service/official passport holders - travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity.As Mr Busuttil said, in order to maintain equal treatment for all EU citizens, the agreements include a provision stipulating that the six non-EU countries may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Community and, reciprocally, that the Community may also suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all of its Member States.There you have it; I am grateful to Parliament and to Mr Busuttil for his cooperation. It reinforces this initiative, which will thus make travelling easier for our fellow citizens. I would also add that, in this slightly chilly Parliament, we can dream of sooner or later visiting all of these marvellous countries, such as the Seychelles and the Bahamas...\nPERSON113 : Madam President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is in favour of the European Union agreements with these six countries, which are indeed dream destinations, Mr Barrot.As you informed us, with these agreements, citizens of these six countries and, reciprocally, EU citizens, will, in future, be exempted from the short-stay visa requirement - at least some of them will be, since excluded from this exemption are those who wish to work or to perform a paid activity, as an employee or as a service provider, in short. This means that those exempted from the visa requirement are businessmen and women, sportspeople and artists - at least when it comes to performing a one-off activity - journalists and trainees, among others.Let us not be fussy and let us welcome this progress, since we know all the administrative formalities that are carried out in our embassies in order to issue visas to citizens of countries of the South.I am sure, ladies and gentlemen - at least those who are left - that you have all heard about these cases of artists who are prevented from attending a festival or of sportspeople who cannot take part in competitions. We in the GUE/NGL Group are in favour of abolishing all short-stay visas. They go against the free movement of persons and plunge the citizens of those countries into a vicious circle that encourages them to apply for short-stay visas and, once they have obtained them, not to return to their countries for fear of not being able to obtain another visa. In return, we, in our countries, keep cracking down on short-stay visa holders, and a vicious circle emerges. This even leads to actual family breakdowns between migrants, who are living in our countries, and their families, who remain in their countries of origin. We therefore believe that these agreements are a positive step in the direction of another migration policy, which would see men and women move as freely as capital and goods.We do have one small point - one small technical point to make - however, Commissioner. We noticed that the English term 'valid passport' was translated into French as 'passeport ordinaire', but we do not believe that this is the same thing. We would therefore be delighted to have clarification on this point, since we believe that the correct translation would be 'passeport en cours de validit\u00e9'.We are also surprised - the word 'surprised' is perhaps a polite way of putting it - we are therefore surprised that these agreements do not apply to the outermost regions of France when they do apply to the outermost regions of Portugal.\nPERSON114 : (PT) I would just like to support Simon Busuttil's report, which endorses the European Commission's initiative, by making three brief points. Firstly, with this decision, which facilitates movement, we are disproving the idea of a Fortress Europe. Secondly, we are not throwing open the doors at random. As Vice-President Barrot reminded us, we are opening them in accordance with the rules. As he said, the countries have complied with the rules and can come off the negative list.I believe that it is important to take a European approach, and avoid 'picking and choosing' countries, accepting some and barring others. Either the whole European area is accepted or it is not. Finally, as Simon Busuttil and Vice-President Barrot emphasised, guarantees of reciprocity are essential in these agreements. We cannot very well ask Europe to open its doors to other countries if these countries do not open their doors to Europe, and this is amply ensured in these agreements.\nPERSON115 : Madam President, I should like firstly to thank Mrs Vergiat and to tell her that she is perfectly right - it is indeed 'passeports en cours de validit\u00e9' - and, secondly, to say that this opportunity is one that we wish to pursue as far as possible.I think that Mr Coelho also made it clear, after Mr Busuttil, that we have to be very strict as regards reciprocity and that we also need real European solidarity: we cannot leave a Member State to the mercy of the reintroduction of visas. We need real solidarity on the part of all the Member States and of the Union.I am grateful once again to Mr Busuttil for clearly identifying the problem and for offering us Parliament's support in this way.\nPERSON116 : I would simply like to thank all those who have intervened. This goes for my colleagues as well as for the Vice President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot. If I had to summarise this institution's political message in a single phrase, it would clearly be that of the principle of reciprocity. This is important to us. It is of considerable significance in the agreement we have before us, in the same way that agreements with other third countries are essential. The Vice President of the Commission knows that there are several other third countries that are still not honouring the principle of reciprocity with regard to all the Member States of the European Union. The United States are amongst these, having recently included a number of countries into its visa waiver programme but left others out. Brazil, with whom negotiations have recently taken place, is another case in point. I augur that whenever an agreement is concluded, insistence be made upon the principle of reciprocity, and I believe that it is these type of agreements that can serve as the foundation for this to happen elsewhere.\nPERSON117 : The joint debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow."

"transcript": "PERSON193 : The next item is the report by Lasse Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the EU Consumer Policy strategy 2007-2013.\nPERSON194 : rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the report before us has undergone a thorough reading in committee, for which I thank my colleagues and above all the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups. In a spirit of consensus we have noted the Commission's laudable efforts to highlight consumer issues in all areas of policy.This continent will not be able to compete in global markets unless it can compete in its own internal market. The 27 national mini-markets must be combined to constitute the largest retail market in the world.A viable internal market requires action to boost consumer confidence. Strong and independent consumer organisations have an important role in this.Among the options for increasing confidence there is one which has stood out more than others in our discussions and which also caused the only disagreements worth mentioning. It is about the possibility of consumers having the tools to pursue compensation if something goes wrong. The view is expressed in this report that it is indispensable for consumers to have a cross-border collective redress system in cases where there is a dispute.Commissioner Kuneva has already promised to start considering what sort of system of collective redress might work in Europe. At least there seems to be broad consensus among us in Europe on what sort of system it should not be. It should not have any fundamental similarity with the American collective redress system, which mainly benefits lawyers, not consumers. In Europe we have to aim for a system where claims for compensation are directly linked to actual damage caused. This way, how justice is dispensed would not so much focus on the penalty but on obtaining justice for the consumer. Collective redress systems would therefore not give consumers new rights, but would ensure that their present rights can be exploited to the full.The conservatives as a group have been unwilling to take forward the idea of collective redress. The reason suggested is that the Commission has already promised to start drafting proposals on it. Parliament, however, is the political decision-maker elected by the people of Europe, and we must make its majority will evident. We have both the authorisation and an obligation to think about new and detailed solutions to issues the public see as problematic and propose them to the Commission.I have proposed that the Commission looks into whether it would be useful to establish a post of Consumer Ombudsman reporting to the Commission, who would specifically deal with cross-border cases. This high official could act as a gatekeeper, a sort of selective authority, as is the case in national contexts when means of legal redress are being implemented. Hopefully, the report and the compromises contained in it will receive the widest possible support.\nPERSON195 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for supporting the objectives and actions of our Consumer Policy Strategy for the years 2007-2013 and of course for the great support and work of the rapporteur.I welcome the view of Parliament on the necessity to transform the 27 national mini-markets into a pan-European retail market - the largest in the world. To achieve this, we need to increase the confidence of consumers to shop across borders. We often say that trust is the currency of the modern economy. I believe that, through our endeavours and substantial efforts, helped by the set of our strategy, we could, step by step, achieve this goal.In this context, I also very much appreciate the support given to the proposed framework directive on consumer contractual rights, which is the tool for achieving the goal. I am particularly pleased with the agreement of Parliament on the need for targeted full harmonisation where bottlenecks to the functioning of the internal market are identified.On the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, I am grateful for the welcome given by the European Parliament to this initiative and look forward to your full support later this year. The Scoreboard is central to the aim of the strategy of better understanding how the internal market is working for our consumers - to measure the outcome of the internal market for consumers. When the Scoreboard is fully developed, we will really be able to deliver better regulation and evidence-based policy-making. Equally important, we will demonstrate to our citizens that we understand and can respond to their day-to-day concerns.You raised the question of redress. I would like to thank you for your support for the Consumer Policy Strategy's focus on redress and enforcement. Redress, together with enforcement, is a key part of this Strategy. Like you, I strongly believe that, in order to make the internal market work, European consumers must be confident that they can enforce their rights and obtain redress across the whole European Union. I also believe that a complementarity of means of redress - judicial and non-judicial, both individual and collective - would allow the most efficient and appropriate treatment of consumer disputes. This would benefit both consumers and reputable businesses alike. Personally, I think that collective redress - both judicial and non-judicial - could be an effective means for strengthening the redress framework that we have already set up for European consumers. We have done this through the encouragement of ADR - alternative dispute resolution - mechanisms, the establishment of a European cross-border small claims procedure and the newly adopted Directive on Mediation.Of course any future action in this area will need to be assessed carefully. As you know, I have launched two studies aimed at further exploring the issue of collective redress. The first one will examine the effectiveness and efficiency of existing collective redress mechanisms; it will assess whether consumers suffer a detriment in those Member States where collective redress is not available and examine the existence of negative effects for the single market.The second study will provide information on the problems faced by consumers in obtaining redress for mass claims and will analyse the economic consequences of such problems for consumers, competitors and the relevant market.I plan to use the results of these studies and the information collected from stakeholders and Member States for preparing a communication to be adopted by the Commission by the end of 2008. The aim of this communication will be to consult publicly and widely on the options available in the field of consumer collective redress.At the same time, I am evaluating how the Directive on Injunctions was implemented by the Member States and the impact that it has had on the enforcement of consumer rights in the EU. My conclusions will be set out in a report that should also be adopted by the Commission at the end of this year.Again, thank you to Parliament for sharing the vision of the new, market-based consumer policy - one where informed and empowered consumers confidently look for, and benefit from, the best offers in terms of price and quality in the largest retail market in the world.\nPERSON196 : Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission communication, as well as the report of Mr Lehtinen as both are overall very balanced pieces of work.Moreover, they rightly bring out an important notion that must be addressed at EU level - consumer policy is and must be part of the internal market.This leads me to what the Committee on Economic Affairs has rightly brought into the report: completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy. EU-wide competition brings prices down and increases quality and consumer choice. The EU-wide access to consumers to these choices must be asserted.In an internal market, consumers are drivers of the market economy and can, through their choices, protect their own interests. Therefore, the consistent implementation of existing directives regarding the internal market is of paramount importance.The Committee on Economic Affairs' opinion correctly highlights two areas that are of particular importance in this respect. First, financial services: a real internal market in banking, loans, insurance etc. is needed to empower European consumers. This is especially pressing as democratic developments are making best possible investment services increasingly relevant to all. Big hurdles remain to be overcome here.Second, e-commerce. This is linked to functioning financial markets and conditioned by the development of payment systems, but it is also important to practically all aspects of the internal market as the internet offers a real European marketplace. So we must make sure that European e-commerce really functions and consumers have right choices there.\nPERSON197 : Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, in the Committee on Legal Affairs we agree with you, Commissioner: let us get rid of these 27 mini-markets; but, in order to do that, you need a much more common legal framework. I think our starting point that would help us get there is if we saw all elements of the Commission who are involved with the internal market working also coherently together. The one issue that has long interested us, and we felt that perhaps there was not sufficient mention of, was the contract law project and the common frame of reference.We do not want to feel that this is being forgotten and everybody is moving on to the next thing which we support you in, in terms of collective redress, but let us also devote our efforts still towards the common frame of reference. We would like to have seen more emphasis on ADR forms of redress, particularly in the on-line world which is something we, as a committee, have long supported. With collective redress, yes, we are happy that you look at it and we go forward in that area, but please do not let us end up where we have with contract law, bedevilled with questions over legal base and other issues.\nPERSON198 : draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (SV) Mr President, let me say a big thank you to the Commissioner, Meglena Kuneva, and rapporteur Lasse Lehtinen.I welcome the strategy and am very glad that consumers are being treated as an important group to look after. We know that we shall never get a flourishing internal market unless we have satisfied and secure consumers. But I share the rapporteur's view that the strategy calls for continuous follow-up if it is really to develop to the consumers' advantage.As rapporteur for the strategy in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, however, I am disappointed that the main reporting committee did not take account of more than one of our 13 amendments. They contain many important and worthwhile proposals. We wanted to see a clearer gender perspective. Consumer policy is definitely not gender-neutral. Gender should be taken into account just as children, the elderly and the disabled are taken into account. I hope that this can be taken up again in the next review.\nPERSON199 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, my thanks to Mr Lehtinen and to the shadow rapporteurs for the good cooperation over the last few months. This report introduces some very positive elements in the area of consumer policy moving forward. Consumers can only exercise their rights if they are aware of those rights, and empowerment of consumers in the EU is a central element of this report, and this will be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. Special focus will be given to equip consumers with the skills and tools needed to increase their confidence in the digital environment.The report commends the Commission's efforts to strengthen cooperation in the area of product safety and at international level, in particular with Chinese and US authorities. Continued dialogue and information-sharing on product safety is in the interest of all parties and is central to building consumer confidence.In relation to consumer redress, together with my PPE-DE colleagues I strongly support easy and effective access to redress for all consumers in the EU. We know that non-judicial forms of redress are the preferred solution of most consumers as they serve consumers' interests most rapidly at the lowest possible cost.As I have stated since the outset of discussions, I do not support calls for legislative action to introduce an ill-thought-out system of collective redress in the EU. The Commission is currently preparing various studies on existing systems of consumer redress in the Member States and rather than pre-empt the results of the Commission studies I, together with my PPE-DE colleagues, call for a strong role for Parliament and the Member States in assessing the results of the studies before deciding upon further action. It is not in consumers' interests to hastily introduce a system of collective redress which would be both costly and ineffective. In all other respects I support the report.\nPERSON200 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my thanks to Mr Lehtinen for the really good draft report he has given us, which provides us with a very sound basis for our discussions.I should like to highlight three very important points from this report. The first is the need to ensure that a leading role is played by instruments which we already possess in the European Union for the promotion of safety and prevention. This is why it is very important that the RAPEX system should be further improved so that it can serve the interests of consumers even more effectively.The second very important point is that Solvit, which is such a key instrument, should be nurtured and improved. There is still a very considerable information gap among consumers, too many of whom have never heard of Solvit and do not know that it could resolve a good few problems for them. That is also very important.I am also very gratified that the European Commission is to examine the EE symbol again. Many people believe that the EE symbol is a safety mark, but unfortunately it is not. We should ensure, together with you and Commissioner Verheugen, that the rules governing this symbol are formulated so as to enable us to assure the public in future that they can rely on the safety of products bearing the EE mark. That is a very important aim.The last and most important point, however, in the view of my group is the system of collective redress that we in the Socialist Group are advocating. The entire statute book serves no purpose if consumers cannot assert their enshrined rights, be it because there is a cross-border dimension which makes the law very difficult to enforce or because there are many small claims for minor losses, although these can certainly suck people dry over time. It is absolutely essential that we not only encourage the European Commission to examine and develop such a system but actually urge it to do so and to present us with an appropriate piece of draft legislation as soon as possible so that we can really give consumers due security and protection.I very much regret that the PPE-DE Group has not seen fit to advocate this system with the vigour and commitment that are needed to give consumers and the public at large real confidence in the European Union and the internal market, for such confidence comes from knowing that they are properly protected when they go shopping in Europe.\nPERSON201 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on this good and balanced draft report. We are in agreement on very many points. One reason for this has been the very good preliminary work of the Commission in this case. There are few contentious points.Consumer strategy will be one of the main topics of discussion during the next stage in the development of the internal market. At the heart of the three main challenges facing the European Union, namely growth, employment and the recognition and satisfaction of people's needs, are 490 million consumers. The internal market has the potential to become the world's largest retail market. This is why the ALDE Group supports the Commission's targeted efforts to create one large retail market out of 27 mini-markets.We also welcome the way in which the draft reinforces the horizontal element of consumer policy as well as its proposal for the appointment of what it calls consumer-liaison officers. In this context I should make special mention of the proposed strengthening of the European Consumer Centres and the particular attention given to the needs of children and elderly people.May I also say something on the subject of collective redress, with which we have a problem. We have had little information and much dogma. I believe it would be premature, Meglena, to say that you will have the solid backing of Parliament on this matter. We have just heard from the PPE-DE Group that it will not back you. I believe the PPE-DE is failing to recognise the real problems. There is a scatter-gun type of damage that affects many consumers in more than one country. It is legitimate for the Commission to give some thought to this whole matter and examine it in a study. On the other hand we have PSE dogma, which craves this instrument at all costs as a political tool, regardless of the real problems - and the real problems are manifold.There is, for example, the problem of the legal basis. Where in the Treaty does it say that we here in the Commission and Parliament are entitled to interfere with the Member States' codes of civil and criminal procedure? What did Diana Wallis just tell us on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs? The problem of contract law is still unresolved. The question of opting in or opting out, the role of the Ombudsman - there are many problems to resolve. It is simply not enough to say we do not want the US system. The Americans also had the best of intentions when they first created their system. It goes without saying that they did not intentionally create a bad system at the outset.For these reasons we should maintain an agnostic, critical position. We should wait for the study, take its findings seriously and then engage in an informed, non-dogmatic and responsible discussion, as befits this Parliament.\nPERSON202 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Lehtinen's report deals with the major issues of pro-quality strategy for the coming years. That strategy is important for the citizens of the Union, and I want to stress some of the problems involved. In the creation of national and EU law there should be greater input from consumer organisations, which are encountering difficulties in pursuing their activities and obtaining funding in certain countries. The Union should provide more substantive and financial assistance to those organisations. The collective redress systems applicable in certain countries should be used against dishonest market players, and a collective redress system should be introduced at European level.European consumer centres in the individual countries, as well as consumer organisations and consumer rights spokesmen, should step up information and education activities aimed at special protection for the most vulnerable consumers. Protection can be made more effective through the involvement of the Solvit and RAPEX consumer centres. We support this report.\nPERSON203 : on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President. Support for consumers' rights is often weak and so needs to be strengthened. I therefore thank the rapporteur and members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, who have succeeded in strengthening support for those consumer groups which most need protection: children and the elderly.Strong consumer support calls for active consumer organisations. Individuals are not strong when they stand alone. It is through these organisations that consumers gain strength and acquire more knowledge and information. These organisations therefore need reliable and secure financing. But the insecurity which currently prevails in purchases across national borders needs to be resolved by creating the possibility for group actions to be brought against firms which break the law. The greatest problem for consumers today is that it is difficult to get a dispute between different countries heard because there are no instances to resolve such cross-border disputes. The EU must first develop instances to resolve disputes, not create more EU legislation. I think the proposal to appoint an EU consumer ombudsman is highly dubious. Why introduce more services to be financed at EU level, thereby risking a cut in appropriations for consumers organisations? Consumers will not gain anything from that.In conclusion, I regret that the amendments from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - as usual, I have to say - were voted down in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. They were worthy of a better fate.\nPERSON204 : Mr President, it is a pleasure to take the floor for the first time and within an area of responsibility in which I look forward to working. It is of course positive that through this report the European Parliament is taking the initiative to secure the rights of consumers. However, I fear that, bit by bit, this legislation will simply amount to patching things up. There will be patches that cover up the fact that the EU is organised in such a way that consideration for the free mobility of goods, capital and services will always take precedence over consideration for consumers and other 'soft' areas. I believe that today's debate reflects this.I would like to give two very specific examples of ways in which we must secure the rights of consumers. It is vital that we secure the consumer's right to complain in their own country and in their own language, and it is vital that food products and other goods that could constitute a health risk can be subject to checks in the event of import into the individual countries. The individual countries should be allowed to carry out checks and demand a higher standard than that laid down in EU regulations, out of consideration for the environment and the health of consumers. The EU's consumer health strategy must be based on the principle of caution instead of an ideological school of thought that merely serves to allow all goods to move completely freely across borders. This can be done by securing the right to complain and contact legal bodies locally, as well as by allowing the import of goods to be stopped if there are health-related reasons for doing so.\nPERSON205 : (SK) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report rightly assesses the positive effect of the euro in terms of reducing the cost of financial operations. Consumers have found it easier to compare prices in cross-border contracts and have also welcomed the increased retail potential in the internal market. I agree that the new Member States should be encouraged to continue their reforms and that they should be able to adopt the euro as soon as they fulfil the Maastricht criteria, in order to take full advantage of a common currency in the internal market.The European Parliament will soon have an opportunity to test this proposal in practice when it debates the enlargement of the euro zone to include the Slovak Republic. Slovakia has, with considerable effort and well ahead of target, fulfilled the Maastricht convergence criteria. I reject the attitude of some colleagues who are now hammering us with a vague and fuzzy counter-argument about the permanent sustainability of these criteria. That could go on indefinitely.\nPERSON206 : Mr President, in the internal market consumers and providers, as well as goods and services, should be able to move freely.Consumers must not be less protected in other Member States than at home if we want to ensure and enhance cross-border activities. Therefore, I welcome the horizontal approach in the consumer policy and the better protection it will lead to.It means empowered consumers and strong consumer protection as well as a business-friendly internal market legislation. However, we are concerned about the hasty approach concerning collective redress.It is too early for Parliament to take a position. We need thorough studies of the existing systems in the Member States and an assessment of the need of a European collective redress system. We do not have enough knowledge at this stage of the consequences in terms of risk abuse, higher costs for consumers and businesses and more regulation.I do not believe that anyone supports the introduction of a European system in the EU knowing all the drawbacks and disproportionate consequences it would bring. For now, we encourage other means of redress which are more rapid and at lower costs and leave the regulation to the Member States to be decided nationally. Existing instruments and non-legislative tools can be used at EU level.We call on the Commission to carry out the study and present its results to Parliament and the Member States. Why go further than what is needed in order to achieve the objectives of the Treaty? Why take away the possibility of choice for Member States keeping different dispute-solving mechanisms? There are many questions to be answered.There is no clear indication so far that an EU-collective redress system brings added value to the internal market and its consumers and businesses. The EU should not legislate without strong reasons.\nPERSON207 : (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on the excellent work he has done and on his capacity for listening. His report sets out to improve a Commission strategy that is already based on the principles of protecting and empowering consumers.I support the horizontal approach advocated by the rapporteur as a means of reconciling the protection of consumers - and especially the most vulnerable consumers - with an efficient internal market. Likewise, it is essential that consumer organisations should be given a greater role in preparing legislative proposals.In relation to product safety, the Commission not only needs to pursue its market surveillance efforts; it also needs to act quickly to establish principles for a CE marking system that will offer a genuine guarantee of quality, traceability and safety.Lastly, it is essential to improve access to redress by proposing a European system of collective redress that will allow consumers to exercise their rights in full where there is proven harm, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls of the US system. Voting in favour of these things can only strengthen public confidence in a European market model that is both open and protective.\nPERSON208 : (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's consumer strategy encompasses various thematic areas, in which we very largely support its position. We support you too, Mrs Kuneva, in your personal commitment to the completion of the single market and your particular focus on consumers and their role in the internal market.There are various areas of common ground. Reference has already been made to the aim of strengthening the European Consumer Centres and the Solvit system. That aim enjoys cross-party support. We also acknowledge the need for a horizontal approach to consumer policy but regret the weak emphasis on the law of contract. We must take care that contract law does not cause our proposals to fray at the edges so that we end up with patchwork legislation. This evening's vote in committee showed that consumers trust the law if they are fairly sure that they know it. If time limits vary from one jurisdiction to another, consumer confidence will wane quite considerably. We therefore need the common reference framework, because we need uniform standards in order to build consumer confidence.The same applies to collective redress. We have heard that various groups have adopted diverse positions. The position of the PPE-DE Group is quite clear: we concur with the analysis that there are certain weak points where consumer interests are less well protected, especially with regard to cross-border transactions. We look in vain, however, for an analysis of the reasons why these weak points exist, and no one in the chamber this evening has offered any explanation. We have been promised studies. We shall read them very carefully, page by page. If these studies only analyse the legal position, however, and not the differences between the Member States in terms of the enforcement of their own laws, these studies will bring us no further forward at the end of the day.May I therefore say to you, Mrs Kuneva, that we are wide open to real progress and take a very constructive attitude to the enforcement of existing rights but that these consumer rights cannot be more effectively enforced unless they ultimately work properly in practice. In Germany we have the Capital Investors' Test Cases Act, under which numerous shareholders have brought a group action against Deutsche Telekom; it has become evident in the course of these proceedings that the theory and practice of collective redress are often poles apart.\nPERSON209 : (RO) It is obvious that consumers who are well-informed about their rights can reach a high level of satisfaction and defend their interests. Nevertheless, besides knowledge, citizens also need an instrument available in order to request compensations when their rights are infringed. For this reason, we believe that group actions are necessary and welcome in a form efficient for the consumer and balanced for the market. Continuing and strengthening the process of the internal market supervision is just as necessary.We believe the existent opinion barometer is very useful and will support its financing in the budget for 2009 as well, yet requesting more emphasis on recording and comparing the priced of goods and services traded in the 27 Member States. Last but not least, we should not forget that the consumers' rights should also function in the field of services, including the financial services and the services in the digital environment, where the degree of risk is much higher and it is much more difficult to prove the infringement of rights.\nPERSON210 : Mr President, I want to thank Lasse Lehtinen for a very comprehensive report, which contains an enormous amount of extremely significant ideas. As the Commissioner said earlier, to enable consumers to become better informed and more confident and to exercise that critical choice, we want innovative and safe products and services. All of those things will come from support for consumers and enhancing their rights.I say this to Lasse particularly because I am disappointed that he has allowed all this good work to be overshadowed by one single issue. The problem with this issue about collective redress is that our colleagues in the Socialist Group seem to have already jumped to a conclusion that they want some new European legislation. I was delighted to hear you confirm, Commissioner, that you have two studies - not just one - looking at this issue in depth. We on this side of the House want to await the report before we jump to conclusions, but it appears that our colleagues on the Socialist side think that this is already a great thing and that, because we do not support it, we are some anti-consumer. You only have to read some of the press releases - the colourful releases, the red-coloured releases - that have come out on that side of the House. I just want to reject emphatically the fact that this side of the House is against consumer rights because we are not committing an advance to a proposal for which we do not even have the information. I say this to all our colleagues here: wrapping yourself in red tape and potentially adding great cost to consumers is not pro-consumer. Let us wait and see the conclusions.I say to Alexander Lambsdorff that he has allowed himself to be hijacked by this, but all he has to do tomorrow for us to unanimously support Lasse Lehtinen's report, is to vote for our Amendments 5 and 6, which keep the door firmly open. We will wait for Mrs Kuneva's report and we will look at it and study it with an open mind, but, in the mean time, we will continue to be the great champions for consumers in the internal markets, for their effective rights that will be delivered by the existing legislation we have at the moment.\nPERSON211 : (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lehtinen report quite rightly considers that the needs of consumer protection can be satisfied by legislation only if it is better and simpler, and that a more coherent legal framework for consumer rights is needed.I therefore call upon the Commission and the Member States to provide adequate funding for strong and independent consumer organisations. Such funding is absolutely essential for progress to be made in constructing a true internal market for consumers.Collective redress, meanwhile, deserves the closest attention and my support, given the positive experience recorded in various Member States.I would also like to say, as Mr Lehtinen stresses, that a strong consumer protection system will also benefit competitive producers and sellers, creating incentives for businesses to produce and sell more durable goods, resulting in more sustainable growth.The report goes further than this, however, and I applaud Mr Lehtinen when he states that consumer protection should be an integral part of the planning and design of products and services.Finally, I would like to say that I share his conclusion that effective and improved consumer protection is necessary in order to achieve a better functioning internal market. I would like to thank him and say that I believe we now have the best conditions for a good strategic understanding with Mrs Kuneva in this area.\nPERSON212 : (PL) Mr President, there is no need to stress the importance of customer satisfaction for businesses. Each of us as a consumer knows that dishonest business practices - deliberately misleading information or unsatisfactory after-sales service - effectively makes us disinclined to purchase any more goods or services from the company concerned. It is important, however, that consumers should always have the possibility of real choice, of changing the service provider or seller. Without a doubt, such choice creates a competitive market in which it does not pay market players to discourage consumers. In a competitive market the entrepreneur knows that he risks losing his market position, and with it his profits and prospects of further development. I believe the European Union internal market has such potential. I am pleased that the possibility of creating the internal market exists, that it exists thanks to consumers, and that that fact has been noticed. Obviously, I am not saying we are already operating in such a market. Consumers still lack the knowledge needed in order to seek out the most advantageous offers, and some entrepreneurs withhold that information from them. Moreover, service providers themselves often take insufficient account of consumers' interests.It is therefore important to ensure that consumers' rights are respected, that they have the right to full, intelligible, simple and easily comparable information, and that that right is respected by companies and law-makers. It is no less important that consumers should be informed about their rights and made aware of the tools that exist to help them in taking decisions in a free market. In this respect, consumer organisations have a large part to play. Nor should we forget that the defence of consumers' rights, and the possibility of effectively enforcing them, are immensely important for the proper functioning of the market. As the rapporteur points out, however, defence of the consumer must not serve as an excuse for market protectionism. Our task is to strike the right balance in consumer protection so as not to create a barrier to business development.\nPERSON213 : (SK) I welcome the Commission's report on the EU consumer policy strategy and I also appreciate your efforts, Commissioner Kuneva, to promote a consumer culture based on consumer awareness and better access to information.I believe that strong and independent consumer organisations are the backbone of an effective consumer policy and I am happy that Mr Lehtinen's report included the changes I proposed in article 7, where Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide sufficient finance for consumer organisations. This concerns primarily financial support for intensive training programs aimed at those working in consumer organisations. Consumer organisations are best informed about consumers' needs and should therefore be consulted on all areas of consumer policy that will affect consumers.I fully support the two amendments proposed by my political group, the PPE-DE, to Article 40 of the report dealing with collective redress. Only if such a need is identified by the impact study should the Commission propose a European framework, which would give all consumers in all the Member States easy access to various redress mechanisms in cross-border complaints.\nPERSON214 : (RO) In the context of the European Union consumer protection strategy, I would like to mention the importance of quality of services and products. If consumers are already used to resorting to consumer protection offices in relation to products, this does not happen when it comes to services. Many times, consumers sign contracts for the supply of services without reading the contractual provisions carefully and if they do read them carefully they believe they cannot propose any amendments thereof. In fact, they do not have the same power of negotiation the suppliers of services have, although some observations from consumers could improve the content of contracts and increase their confidence.I would like to draw attention to the need to protect tourists and passengers as regards compliance with their rights which, unfortunately, many of them do not know and claim. Special attention should be given to electronic services as well. The consumers' confidence in digital services is essential for the European Union's competitiveness and, especially, for the development of economy based on knowledge.In conclusion, I would like to mention the fact that we also have to speak about the quality of public services and, in this context, about consumer protection.\nPERSON215 : (RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Lehtinen for the consistent report. Nevertheless, I would like to make an observation regarding Paragraph 35 of the report. This paragraph refers to the creation of a European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office. This proposal seems to be a very complicated and not very efficient procedure to me.First of all, the creation of such a position requires financial resources. We would have a redistribution of funds between the European consumer protection centres and the potential new Ombudsman. Secondly, bureaucracy would increase at the level of the European Union. Last but not least, we would have an overlapping of the newly-created Ombudsman's tasks and the European consumer protection centres. I don't believe that a new instrument would bring more efficiency in solving the complaints filed by European consumers. But I do think that an efficient and thorough implementation of the legislation would reduce the dissatisfaction related to the internal market operation.In conclusion, I request the European Commission representatives to take into consideration Paragraph 7, by which we request the allocation of adequate funds to the consumer organizations across the European Union.\nPERSON216 : (CS) Mr President, globalisation of our market requires strong, clear and easily enforceable consumer rights and I am happy to see the Commission making very successful efforts in this area. In my report last year I pointed out that consumer confidence in e-commerce would be enhanced by sample consumer contracts and by better mechanisms for dealing with complaints, as well as by the European trustmark and the consumer charter. However, I do not think that a European Consumer Ombudsman will help us a great deal. We need instead to increase financial support for the existing consumer organisations and supervisory bodies in the Member States, because they are the bodies that are increasingly identifying the unsafe products from Asia, namely toys, children's shoes and sports equipment. The citizens expect us to come up with a more successful means of dealing with cross-border complaints, as has already been said here many times. That is further justification for harmonising the rules in the Member States. However, collective redress is problematic; it may be good for the lawyers, but it is often very costly for consumers or providers. I therefore welcome the Commission's intention to assess the results of the German or British model first and only then to consider the possible way forward, not being pushed into a blind alley by the Socialists. I would like to express my appreciation of the work done by our rapporteur and that of the Commission on the reform of the consumer policy.\nPERSON217 : (DE) Mr President, I intend to make my fellow Member Malcolm Harbour happy tomorrow by wearing my red suit to show him that the red corner really does know what it wants. That, in fact, is the difference between what we on the Left are seeking and what those on the Right are up to, namely creating a big blue smokescreen to hide the fact that they do not actually want consumer protection at all but are committed first and foremost to the defence of industrial interests. It is only right that this should be made clear for once.\nPERSON218 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I understood I have only two minutes, but I wish this talk could be much longer. I very much hope that I will continue with all of you, whenever you have time and interest, to discuss together consumer issues. I would be more than delighted, because I receive a lot of incentives - even in this late session.I would like to make my political commitment, that I will continue to tackle the issues with sustainable development, working on CEE and GPSD (the General Product Safety Directive) and they how could they be complementary to each other. Of course I will continue with the digital guide, which was one of the very first talks which I had with Ms Roithov\u00e1. I am, of course, working together with my fellow commissioners; this portfolio is becoming more and more wide-ranging and evolving other portfolios, but I believe that this is part of the beauty of this portfolio.So, there are many things. Let me agree with all of you in saying that if we would like to have a complete internal market, we need to stress the rights of consumers. This is really the only way to fulfil and to square the second phase of the internal market. I believe that if we are making good progress with our scoreboard, this scoreboard will be part of the internal market's bigger picture, and then we will have already quite a full understanding of how the European internal market is going on.I was specially touched by Mrs Dahl - I am sorry that she is no longer in the plenary - who said that this was the first time that she had taken the floor. But, referring to the so-called race to the bottom, if we have common rules everywhere in the European Union and not just protecting, in the best way, the national consumer, I think that we should not pick the winners, except one: if the winner is the consumer.We started, years ago, making a good environment for business, and this was the right thing. But if you want to develop European business, business needs consumers, and we cannot deny that consumers need the same tackling of bottlenecks, so that they can feel comfortable everywhere, as a Swede living in Brussels, for example - we need to have the same rights, we need to have the same rights when we are shopping and enjoying e-commerce and other distance selling.Let me focus for a while on collective redress. I carefully listened to all of you. Let me mention that, in our 10 benchmarks, which we distributed, discussed and received more than 300 opinions about, half of these collective redress benchmarks were related not to having punitive damages compensated and not to being an expensive procedure. So at least five of these benchmarks are related and address the issue of not having additional costs.I believe that the best thing is to open our minds and not to make dogma, and this is my plea for support in this aspect. So I would also like to tell you that what we are preparing is communication: this is why we do not have a study on economic, social and environmental impact, as is done for all our legislative proposals. But we are doing something much more in preparation, and this is to have two really very thorough studies, comparative studies.Let me invite you: before the end of the month we will have three big stakeholders' conferences: with businesses, with consumers and with academics, and our services will provide four places in the workshops for European Parliament representatives. All the outcomes of these three events will be absolutely public, put on our websites and communicated in the best manner, and of course I am around and always open to continue to discuss your hopes and your fears.I would like to end by thanking you and saying that maybe for the first time, almost nobody mentioned that Europe is going to do a class action. I believe that this is a positive sign.\nPERSON219 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who spoke here tonight and, of course, Commissioner Kuneva for her constructive attitude that we have become familiar with since she came into office.I have a couple of remarks. Mrs Kauppi mentioned financial services. The growing area of cross-border banking, insurance sales and wealth management which has some very sophisticated instruments is a growing problem. The rules still confuse consumers even at a national level. So I think that in this area we need a cross-border collective redress system as well, because it will make financial institutions more responsible and careful when they explain the rights and risks to the customer.We all know the sad figures that tell us how citizens in Member States are afraid of buying goods and services across borders, which is completely due to a lack of confidence. But I trust that, when we proceed in the good mood in which we have discussed this report among ourselves and with the Commission, we can only succeed in building more confidence among European consumers.\nPERSON220 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008.Written statements (Rule 142)\nPERSON221 : , in writing. - We welcome the ongoing efforts to further incorporate the level of consumers' awareness as the necessary basis for the effective implementation of the existing consumer protection legal framework, especially with regard to the most vulnerable groups of the population.Not only is there a need for a more comprehensive legal framework for consumers' rights, but also we ought genuinely to take into consideration consumers' interests when completing the internal market standardisation. It is obvious that a stronger, unique consumer protection system effective all over the Union is in the interest of all citizens. The completion of the internal market is an opportunity to implement harmonisation measures so as to target the problems faced by consumers in their everyday life. Specific attention should therefore be given to sectors related to the new digital environment.A good consumer is a consumer aware of his or her rights and how rightfully to enforce them. We ought to develop in the Community a genuine consumer culture as part of our education system and to systematically involve consumer organizations in the consultations and the dialogue with industry. We welcome therefore the call to establish a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office on a country-by-country basis.\nPERSON977 : in writing. - (FR) I warmly welcome Mr Lehtinen's report, which puts consumer protection at the heart of efforts to complete the internal market.The report points out that a high level of protection for all consumers in the European Union can be achieved only through a horizontal approach - in other words with the help of sector-based directives aimed at harmonising national laws - and it also underscores the need to strengthen confidence among those same consumers. That depends particularly on ensuring the safety of all products in circulation and the security of all transactions both in the realm of cross-border trade in services and in electronic commerce.I am also pleased that the report proposes research into the implementation at European level of rapid and effective means of redress for consumers. The establishment of non-judicial systems of dispute resolution would be one means of meeting expectations in this regard, as would the adaptation of certain forms of redress such as collective action - which already exist in certain Member States - to the Community legal context.At the same time, I believe it would be useful to explore in greater depth, and in the light of different national experiences, the advantages and the limitations of such arrangements.\nPERSON976 : , in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to see that the European Commission has made the protection of Europe's consumers one of its priorities with its proposed EU Consumer Policy strategy for 2007-2013.I should also like to thank my Finnish Socialist colleague Lasse Lehtinen for his excellent work and the significant contributions he makes in his report.I welcome his vision of a horizontal approach at European level, for it is essential that the interests of consumers should be taken into account in all the Union's policies. At the same time I support his wish to give consumer associations a greater role in drafting European rules, and his proposal to improve protection for the most vulnerable consumers, particularly young and elderly people, through more information campaigns aimed specifically at them.I also strongly support the introduction of a European system of collective redress that would enable consumers in different Member States to take their complaints jointly to the courts and seek redress, while avoiding the pitfalls of the US model. So I hope that, despite opposition on the conservative side, this House will vote in favour of a European 'class action' system.\nPERSON975 : , in writing. - (FI) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehtinen, for the work he has done in compiling this report.One of the most important objectives of the consumer policy strategy proposed by the Commission is to make consumer protection the focus of the EU internal market.I would like to stress that this is the very means by which we will be able to establish the best possible conditions for our consumers, and take an important step closer to attaining the objectives of the European Union.How can we achieve this? Consumers must have access to accurate information on which to base their decisions. An informed consumer is also a more active consumer! An internal market which is working well must provide the EU's citizens with good options as well as reasonable prices and the opportunity to purchase high-quality goods and services.Another important issue is class actions, which cannot be brought in Estonia, unlike some of the countries which are our neighbours. I do not believe, however, that this has been to the benefit of our consumers. Quite the reverse.It is important to learn from the experiences of others: claims for damages must be related to the actual harm suffered. Similarly it is important for consumers to be able to rely on their rights; they should not have to waive them because they do not have the resources to take the providers of goods or services in other countries to court.Our clear wording protects the consumers' interests in that regard and I believe that the need for class actions has become a key cross-border issue."

"transcript": "PERSON127 : Mr President, I thank the shadow rapporteurs once again for their excellent cooperation. During or dialogue with their representatives who were present at all stages, we have arrived at a very satisfactory compromise with the Council, thanks to the Commission's contribution.However, there is a risk that this compromise may collapse, leaving us back at square one, if Amendments 37 and 41 on Almad\u00e9n are approved.Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that at first reading I, too, as rapporteur, supported the Almad\u00e9n amendments, but we are now faced with reality. Neither the Council nor the Commission accepts these amendments. If they are approved, we shall be back at square one. A year ago, the Council accepted only one of the European Parliament's amendments. Now, with the cooperation of all the political groups, we have succeeded in having 22 amendments accepted in the text of the agreement. I ask you: are we going to sacrifice this success? Yesterday, Commissioner Dimas was quite clear. The Commission does not accept Amendments 37 and 41. In the Council, not even the Spanish Government insisted on these amendments.I therefore call on you to reject these amendments so that we can make good the significant progress achieved in our agreement with the Council over protecting the environment and public health. This will allow us to approve a satisfactory move towards banning the export of mercury by a very large majority."

"transcript": "PERSON130 : President-in-Office. - Mr President, once again, thank you very much. With your permission I would like to give the following statement on behalf of the Council.We have considered the following amendment which the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted. It is the new recital 12a.I quote: 'Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrator commenced its activity. It should be borne in mind in this connection that the prior grant of an authorisation, licence or concession should not constitute a defence in such circumstances.' End of quote.We understand the intentions that have been expressed in this amendment. These matters belong under the competence of the Member States. We believe that the Member States will duly take into consideration these intentions.Thank you.\nPERSON131 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this declaration may not amount to the same rhetoric as Mr Cohn-Bendit's. I have to read this declaration and I quote: 'The Commission took note of the following amendment adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs: \"Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrator commenced its activity. It should be borne in mind in this connection that the prior grant of an authorisation, licence or concession should not constitute a defence in such circumstances.\u201d We fully understand the concerns expressed in this amendment. These matters fall within the competence of Member States and we are confident that they will take due account of these important concerns.'\nPERSON132 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two declarations prompt me to point out, for the benefit of those fellow Members who may not have fully understood what is going on, that these declarations form part of the compromise which we have agreed. We asked for clarification of two or three problems which has been provided in this way. However, the subject of the legislative procedure is of course solely the text as agreed jointly by us.I have the letter here from the Chair of Coreper - which is currently chaired by Slovenia - which confirms that this text, if we adopt it today, will also be approved by the Council. That means, of course, that we will have agreement at first reading which will give us the legislative success that we want to achieve."

"transcript": "PERSON118 : Before we proceed to the vote itself, there is just one point which I would like to make. I would ask you to listen very carefully now, and then some of the chairmen of the parliamentary groups will be given the floor. There is an amendment which has been proposed by Mr Trakatellis, Mr Varvitsiotis, Mr Papastamkos, Mr Lambrinidis and other Members regarding one particular week in the year 2009, namely week 16, from 13 to 19 April. This is the week directly before the Orthodox Easter. It is not Easter itself, but the week before. However, no proposal has been made for a part-session in this particular week, as it is the group week. That means that this amendment is not admissible because there is no proposal for the European Parliament to meet in this particular week. However, this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part-session from 20 to 23 April.\nPERSON119 : (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and this includes interreligious dialogue. Thus I ask you, in your capacity as the European Parliament, to set an example and respect minorities. It is for this reason, in a spirit of compromise and goodwill towards our Orthodox friends, that my Group suggests the following amendment to the calendar of part-sessions for 2009. Week 17, the plenary week in April 2009, will commence on 21 April and end on 24 April - I do not wish to say any more than that - to allow the Members concerned to celebrate the Orthodox Easter.On behalf of all countries with an Orthodox tradition, I thank you for your support and ask you not to create any additional controversy. I wish to ask, however, for the support of the European Parliament out of respect for minorities, to set an example for our fellow citizens.\nPERSON120 : (DE) Mr President, I assume that this is an oral amendment. That was not stated, but if it is an oral amendment, my Group is in favour of voting on it today. It is also a fact that many Catholics work here on religious holidays; tomorrow is one such day, despite the strike. That situation also arises, but I would nonetheless recommend that we vote in favour of this motion or at least put it to the vote. Mr President, if you find that it is not admissible, the groups should try afterwards to achieve a consensus in this spirit.\nPERSON121 : There are certain issues on which we must have a consensus and I suggest that we proceed as Mr Daul and Mr Swoboda have proposed. This will be voted on at the end. We will take the other amendments first.\nPERSON122 : (DE) Mr President, before the vote, I would like to point out a problem which affects the vote and which may need to be discussed and resolved.In the calendar proposed, there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009. We are not voting on that now, we are simply noting it. However, because of the date of the elections, the constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009. That being the case, Members from some countries have concerns because, if you look closely, it is clear that, if the constituent sitting takes place on 14 July 2009, some Members will not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights. In some Member States, they do not use the legislative term but a fixed period because the legislative terms in the Member States vary in length.I think that there are good grounds to consider and resolve this problem, either as regards the date of the election or the date of the constituent sitting. I would therefore ask Parliament's Legal Service to look at this issue.\nPERSON123 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to make a similar proposal.I am astonished that the right of minorities is being deployed in such moralistic terms. There are around seven Jewish festive days which cannot be observed because they are working days. The same applies to 13 Protestant festive days as well. The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July. This is one of the most important secular holidays. Can we work in France on 14 July as we commemorate the French Revolution? I think that is impossible and inappropriate. That needs to be changed as well, please!(Applause)\nPERSON124 : We have noted what has been said and shall now proceed to the vote.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"

"transcript": "PERSON135 : rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, farm structure surveys are some of the oldest Community-level statistical surveys, and they provide substantial and necessary information on agricultural holdings in the European Union.Especially now that we have an enlarged EU that includes twelve new Member States, and since we are working at this very moment on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is exceedingly important to be able to conduct a new and comprehensive survey as soon as possible. We need comparable and uniform data to enable us to devise an equitable and properly functioning agricultural policy. This is why I have tried to ensure that we will be able to reach an agreement at the first reading, and get these surveys under way as soon as possible.I would especially like to thank my fellow Members who participated in the trialogue for their exceptionally constructive approach; I would particularly like to thank Mrs Elisabeth Jeggle and Messrs Nicolas Meves and Alexis Kuhl for their work. The amendments tabled as a result of the trialogue have been put into block one. I would ask you all to support the amendments in block one and then we will be able to close this dossier.

I think that without the rapporteur present we cannot continue the debate, so I am asking you to give me permission to close the debate today. Are there any objections?\nPERSON499 : Mr President, I just want some clarification. Do we have a reason why these people are not here, why the rapporteur is not here? Do you have an excuse or some information?\nPERSON500 : The reason is that they are not here with us, and this is the only reason I can recognise. We have no idea; we have no secret agents.\nPERSON501 : (FI) Mr President, we all know that Mr Wojciechowski, as Chairman of the Committee, is only the formal author of the question. I myself have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention for many years. I have come here from a fantastic asparagus reception specifically to speak on this subject, and I would like to have my say.(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON502 : With respect for your fantastic asparagus reception, without the author of the question we cannot proceed. I do not know what secret relations you have with the author of the question, but unfortunately we cannot continue. I am very sorry, Madam Commissioner.\nPERSON503 : (ES) Mr President, I fail to see which Rule of Procedure prevents us from discussing the issue. The Commissioner is here, and she certainly deserves our respect. I think that all the Members present are ready and willing to debate this matter. I fully understand Mr Ouzk\u00fd's preferences and priorities, and have the utmost respect for them, but at the present time, unless the Rules of Procedure explicitly prevent us from debating the issue, I feel that out of respect for the Commissioner and our fellow Members, we ought to be able to do so.\nPERSON504 : I think we are taking this very seriously. How can we have a debate without the question, and without the author of the question? With respect for Mr Ouzk\u00fd's other obligations, he is not with us and he is not presenting the question. Although I have a very good imagination, I cannot imagine the answer to the question without the substance of the question, despite the presence of the Commissioner and two main speakers, two distinguished Members of the European Parliament from the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups. So if we want to behave in a serious manner, I think we should stop this debate. If you want to continue answering the question without the question, that is fine with me.So I suggest we close the sitting. We will have the opportunity to continue.\nPERSON505 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will send the reply to the question in writing.Written answer of the Commission2008 will mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Aarhus Convention. The third Meeting of the Parties to the Convention, to be held in June, in Riga, will be an opportunity for the Parties to review the progress achieved in the Convention's implementation and to reflect on and plan for the challenges that lie ahead.The European Community is a Party to the Convention since May 2005. The years preceding and following 2005 have seen the EU adopting several legislative acts to ensure the implementation of the Convention. Yet, challenges remain, including at the level of the Convention itself as, for instance, predictable and stable financial arrangements are still to be agreed upon by all Parties.The Commission's priorities for the third Meeting of the Parties may be summarised as follows:\u00b7 Adoption of a Long-term Strategic Plan outlining ambitious but realistic priorities for the years to come in a pragmatic and practicable manner. In this context I want to stress the importance of implementation which, in the Commission's view, should be the first priority;\u00b7 Adoption of stable and predictable financial arrangements, which would ensure that the work programmes of the Convention can proceed on a sound financial basis;\u00b7 Adoption of an interpretative decision by the Meeting of the Parties clarifying the conditions under which amendments to the Convention enter into force. This decision is of practical relevance and importance already now as it would apply to the amendment to the Convention adopted in 2005 on genetically modified organisms;\u00b7 Continuation of the work with respect to public participation, in particular in international forums, and access to justice in environmental matters; and\u00b7 Contribute to appointing high quality members to the Compliance Committee, which is the main compliance mechanism of the Convention, so that it can usefully assist Parties in furthering the implementation of theConvention.The Commission facilitates the inclusion of Members of the European Parliament as observers in Community delegations attending meetings of governing bodies of multilateral agreements, and has done so already on a number of occasions.I welcome the participation of Members of the European Parliament at MOP3, and am interested to hear your priorities and expectations for this meeting.\nPERSON506 : I should like to inform the House that the sitting will now be closed as the author of the question is absent. A written reply to the question will be provided."

Certainly, the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board is not going to be solved in the next two weeks, so we have time to vote about this resolution in the next mini-plenary session here in Brussels.The reason for this is that we have got some new proposals from the European Commission and maybe it is possible to polish up some of the wordings of the resolution.The deadline was very tight and that is why we want to have more time and to have the vote on this during the next Brussels session.\nPERSON116 : Mr President, I am speaking as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the current financial crisis, everybody realises that accounting standards and their potentially procyclical nature are a major issue. The governance of the structures that develop these accounting standards is a very important matter.The European Commission, already addressed on these issues in the Radwan report, has chosen to draft a proposal that does not involve those who are responsible for the stability of the financial markets, that was drawn up hastily with American authorities who are reaching the end of their mandate and have been disowned by all the candidates in the American presidential election, and without consulting the Council or the European Parliament.In a spirit of compromise and openness, we agree to reopen this discussion if the Commission for its part agrees to reconsider its proposal and to give a hearing to the European Parliament's proposals. That is why I would like the Commission to make a statement and undertake to reconsider its proposal. In that case we would be able to support Mrs Kauppi's proposal.\nPERSON117 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission does not have a position on this point.\nPERSON118 : The Commission has not expressed an opinion.Mrs Ber\u00e8s, did I understand correctly that you would support the proposer of this motion, Mrs Kauppi, in these circumstances?Then we shall take the vote on this motion.(Parliament adopted the motion for postponement of the vote)"

I ask you to take note of this statement.On 26 September 2008 we are celebrating the European Day of Languages. In that framework, the European Union, together with the European Council, is supporting a series of European initiatives aimed at promoting the valuation of languages and cultures and at highlighting to the European public the importance of learning languages.(DE) The linguistic diversity of Europe is an essential element of our intellectual heritage and is one of our cultural treasures. In the course of European unification, linguistic diversity has gradually become less of a barrier and more of an opportunity. This is why the latest communication from the Commission on multilingualism rightly describes our linguistic diversity as a trump card.(FR) Multilingualism and promoting linguistic diversity are cornerstones of our day-to-day activities in the European Parliament. Our motto is 'no legislative work without translation'.(IT) Translation and interpreting of our work as representatives of the peoples of Europe play a vital part in ensuring its legitimacy and transparency and bringing our Parliament ever closer to European citizens.(ES) In that context it should be noted that the European Parliament is the only international organisation which has a website and web television in 23 different languages.(PL) A European Union that is united in diversity need have no concerns about its future.(DE) Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen.(Applause)\nPERSON084 : Mr President, I have a point of order.

I find this unacceptable and I am now raising the matter under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure on accountability and Rule 96 on transparency.I want to know the basis on which we are going back to Strasbourg. I have read the note which went to the Bureau on Monday, but it seems to me that the works only relate to the false ceilings. So, firstly, what do we know about the reasons for the collapse? Is it the design, the materials, the quality of construction or the building inspection? It has got to be one of those four.Secondly, what does it tell us about the rest of the building? We do not know whether the whole building has been checked. Are there faulty materials? One rumour is that the steel used in the building is the same as in the Charles de Gaulle airport roof which collapsed. Is that true or not?(Protests)Well, if you do not give us the truth, rumours will proliferate.This is all without prejudice to Mr Matsakis' concerns about asbestos in the building which he is pursuing with vigour, also with no response I think.I want to know, first of all, why I have not been given the report, what is the basis for the decision to go back to Strasbourg, is the building truly safe, and who has decided it is?(Applause)For my part, this is not, and should not be - and I hope it is not being - dealt with as a political issue. People could have died if they had been there in August, and they could die if anything goes wrong. Please could I have some answers?(The President cut off the speaker.)\nPERSON072 : Baroness Ludford, as far as I am aware, you are a citizen of the United Kingdom. Citizens of the United Kingdom are noted for their pragmatism and their sang froid. May I therefore advise you to keep a cool head now. There was no reason to abuse the right to ask questions.We are preparing an e-mail for all Members. The technical details will be set out in that e-mail in the appropriate languages. Have confidence in the parliamentary administration! We are doing what is necessary. There was no need to admonish us to tell the truth. We are always bound by honesty in all matters, including this one, Baroness.(Applause)\nPERSON073 : (DE) Mr President, on Tuesday five Members from four different political groups put up a large poster to publicise written declaration No 75. The requisite authorisation was obtained from the competent quaestor, Mr Fazakas, before the poster went on display. Someone removed the poster on Tuesday afternoon without informing any of the authors of the written declaration. Yesterday we could not find it at all. Today we discovered that it is with the security service. The reason given to us was that a political decision had been taken to the effect that this written declaration could not be advertised.Since when has the administration decided what is politically right and wrong, particularly after the competent quaestor has given his approval? We are democratic Members of Parliament with the right to state our position. You do not have to agree with the content of the declaration, but removing the poster without informing the authors is wrong; it is a preposterous curtailment of Members' rights. I ask you to comment on this matter.(Applause)\nPERSON074 : Mr Alvaro, your intervention, which is entirely legitimate, is the first I have heard of this incident. I assure you that we shall look into this matter."

"transcript": "PERSON098 : (ES) I have asked to speak pursuant to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure, in relation to Rule 45(2) of the Rules of this House.Rule 45(2) was recently amended to prohibit amendments to motions for resolutions contained in own-initiative reports.The result, as we shall see in the forthcoming vote, is that if a Parliamentary group wishes to amend one line or one paragraph of an own-initiative report, it is required to table a completely separate alternative motion for a resolution where the only difference is one comma, or the insertion or deletion of a single word.Perhaps at the time it seemed like a good idea when the rule was being amended but what is happening now is that it is making it difficult to reach agreements within this Chamber, and reaching agreements should be one of our main objectives. It is impossible to reach any agreement between political groups if the only thing we can do is table a separate text, as we will see in the vote shortly.Mr President, I request that the amendment to Rule 45(2) be reviewed because the effect it is having is absurd and it is interfering with the political relationships between groups in this Chamber.(Applause)\nPERSON099 : I must point out that the European Parliament, in its wisdom, took that decision.(Objection by Mrs Pack)I am afraid so, Mrs Pack, but that cannot be altered. In the meantime, we must adhere to the letter of the law.\nPERSON100 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Guardans should perhaps ask his group as it was one of the proponents of this rule. I should nevertheless like to say this: the report on which we are voting today, the Mikko report on concentration and pluralism in the media, is the first report which we are approving under this procedure, which prevents us from having a full debate, which prevents us from tabling amendments, on a day when there has been a serious, very serious, attack on freedom of expression in Italy, with the announcement of the sacking of 25 journalists from the only television channel over which Berlusconi does not at present hold sway. I think that the way in which we are debating these problems is also indicative of a lack of will in this House to introduce rules, laws or directives on media concentration and pluralism which are increasingly urgently needed in the European Union.(Applause from the centre and the left)\nPERSON101 : Mr President, I would to thank everybody who contributed to this extremely important and high-profile report on media pluralism and concentration in the European Union. The report is about safeguarding democracy. We have tried to include everything that strengthens democracy in this report. That is why you should try to focus and think twice before you vote. What are you in favour of, and what are you opposing? We are sending this message to our citizens today. Please think.(Applause)\nPERSON102 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for this topic, I would like to join those who say that this system is not good as it is. I would have liked to express the opinion of the People's Party in the Parliamentary debate, but, as shadow rapporteur, I was not given the floor.I would like to ask why, if pluralism in the media is so important, pluralism of opinion is not so important? I would have liked to explain the fact that we do not agree on some things, but I was not given the floor. Of the whole Parliament, two people were allowed to speak on this topic; the rapporteur and the Commissioner. We absolutely must consider whether this system is good, because we are curious about each other's opinions, and this is called pluralism of opinion. Please, Mr President, help us to bring this to fruition.(Applause from the right)\nPERSON103 : Ladies and gentlemen, I give Mr Cohn-Bendit leave to speak, but then we must proceed to the vote. We can draw the appropriate conclusions about the consequences of our own decision. If we have made a questionable decision, we have the right to amend it ourselves, but the amendment must be made in accordance with the proper procedures.\nPERSON104 : (DE) Mr President, this particular piece of nonsense you just referred to was adopted by the majority of this House in spite of our voting against it. It was your decision! Give your chairman hell now so that he gets it amended!(Applause from the centre and left)\nPERSON105 : We do not really want to give anyone hell, but conclusions can be drawn if the majority of the House so wishes.\nPERSON106 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of looking in any detail at the inaccurate statements that Mrs Frassoni has made, but I feel that I must make one clarification to the House. In Italy, it is not President Berlusconi but other groups which own television channels. Mr President, in Italy, there are three state television channels: Rai 1, Rai 2 and Rai 3, there is the Mediaset group and then in Italy there is LA7 ...(Protests from the centre and the left)\nPERSON107 : Ladies and gentlemen, there is no reason to get worked up. You took a decision.If Parliament has taken a decision that the majority may deem to have been unwise, it can be changed. But a rule is observed until such time as it is amended. That is the principle we follow in Parliament.(Applause)"

We wish to protest against this. I move that the word 'legal' be deleted since every child has the right to education if he or she is registered in a country.\nPERSON074 : If there are no objections to what Mrs Prets has proposed, we will, of course, check the text once more very carefully on this basis.\nPERSON075 : Mr President, I am not sure if the interpretation missed it.

Please agree that 'truth' be inserted: reconciliation with truth and remembrance. Please vote for truth.\nPERSON119 : Mr President, the text refers to crimes against humanity that were still happening 'as late as July 1995'. It would be better to say 'were still taking place in July 1995', because nobody can be sure that there were no more such crimes in 1996.(Interjection from the floor)Yes, indeed - that would be softer; 'took place as late as' should be replaced with 'were still taking place in'.\nPERSON121 : Mr President, this is a minor correction. The text now reads 'whereas the Central European countries had the added experience of Communism'. I would like to change 'Central European countries' to 'Central and Eastern European countries', because everywhere else the text reads this way, and to replace 'had the added experience of Communism' with 'have experienced both Communism and Nazism', because, to Eastern European nations, nothing was 'added' by Communism: most of them had Communism first, then Nazism, and then Communism again.\nPERSON123 : (PL) Mr President, I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution.(FR) Mr President, I also signed this resolution and I do not see my name on the motion for a resolution.

You have this in your voting list.\nPERSON080 : (IT) Mr President, I appreciate the rapporteur's suggestion, but this resolution contains too many references - not only in this point and in this footnote of the proposed oral amendment, but in many other parts of the resolution. For various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the footnote, relating to the very subjects that appear in other parts of the resolution. I therefore believe, Mr President, and this is my proposal, that my fellow Member should ask for the resolution to be further amended and then referred back to committee for re-examination.\nPERSON082 : (IT) Mr President, on the admissibility of Mrs V\u0103lean's amendment: Mrs V\u0103lean was quite right to go back and correct the text, removing the vague and misleading reference to third and fourth wives, which led to doubts over the legitimacy of polygamy.We should nevertheless clarify that, unfortunately, the questionnaire sent to the Member States contained this incorrect terminology. In other words, Member States were asked for their opinion on the right to free movement of second, third and fourth wives.(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON083 : Mrs Angelilli, the debate is over. Anyone who does not wish to support Mrs V\u0103lean's motion can stand up.

"transcript": "PERSON129 : Mr President, I rise to ask colleagues to consider the referral of this motion for a resolution back to committee. I do so on foot of what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said here last night in the debate. I do not do so lightly, because I share the concerns of all colleagues who have spoken in this debate and as expressed in this resolution.But I would like to say, to be fair to the Commissioner, that it is not our intent to cause her any problems at a critical stage in the negotiations she is having at the moment with the Arctic Council. She has specifically stated that 'such a proposal would at this stage' - and I am quoting from the transcript of what she said in plenary - 'not only be ineffective, but could prove to be detrimental to the EU's role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation'.In her conclusion, she specifically referred to the timing of our motion. The Commission has submitted an application to the Norwegian Chair of the Arctic Council to extend the international Convention on the Law of the Sea. That has to be accepted by unanimity, and the vote is on 29 April - in three or four weeks' time. So she very clearly asked for a postponement, even though she fully shares our sentiments. On that basis, could I suggest we consider referring it back to committee?\nPERSON130 : Mr President, could I say on behalf of the ALDE Group that we would support Mrs Doyle's proposition? I think it has much merit. The House had a resolution on this issue in October of last year. To a certain extent we are repeating what we said then, but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and, as Mrs Doyle said, they come at a critical moment when most of us in this House would want to see the EU take up a seat on the Arctic Council, and we would not wish to compromise that.It would be much better to refer this back to committee and have a full and considered report in the new mandate.\nPERSON131 : Ladies and gentlemen, just to make it clear what it is that we are now voting on, we cannot refer this back to committee as it did not come from a committee, but we can postpone the vote. This is what the Rules of Procedure dictate.\nPERSON132 : (FR) Mr President, excuse me, but you have not given the floor to the opposing side.I find it extraordinary that we should have debated this resolution yesterday and that, on the contrary, the moment we table it and we call for a 50-year moratoriumon the exploitation of oil resources, the moment we call for a binding charter, and when we know that the countries have until the end of April to go to the UN to claim sovereignty over the seabed and therefore, in effect, this idea of sovereignty, accompanied by military deployment, everything should depend on what we do right now.If we fail to show the difference and make our voice heard, we will take a step backwards, and we will not be proactive, and I am absolutely opposed to that.(Applause)"

They asked to extend the demand to release political prisoners who have recently been arrested also to people who face other kinds of restrictions and harassment. That is why I propose - and I have consulted other political groups - to add to paragraph 4: 'as well as a review of the \"restricted freedom\u201d sentences imposed on 11 persons who participated in a demonstration which took place in January 2008;'.\nPERSON109 : Mr President, when three young activists are mentioned as being subject to forcible army conscription, one of them at least is the son of the opposition leader, Mr Via\u010dorka. So it is worth mentioning that it is tantamount to state-practised hostage-taking: 'Look, be calm in your position because your son is in our army and something may happen to him.' That would be a little warning, maybe giving more security for those young men forcibly conscripted into the army.\nPERSON111 : Mr President, when the suggestion is made that the European Humanities University should go back to Belarus, it is worth mentioning that it should be on the basis of genuine guarantees that it will be able to operate freely and not be taken back under the control of the regime.\nPERSON113 : (DE) Mr President, we are happy to respond to individual oral motions, but I would ask Mr Landsbergis to inform us in advance so that such subjects can be discussed even when he is not there.

"transcript": "PERSON303 : The Minutes for yesterday have been distributed.Are there any comments?\nPERSON304 : (FR) Madam President, I ask the Members to allow me to take up a few minutes of their time.I would like to speak on the subject of China. There was a motion for a resolution for today on China, on the case of Mr Gao Zhisheng, a well-known lawyer who is under arrest. There are fears that he will be tortured; his family has just been allowed entry to the United States and there are fears for his life.Unfortunately, though, as only three subjects may be dealt with, the motion relating to Mr Gao Zhisheng could not be included. We did intend to move it in the March II session. Now, we have been told that there will be no urgent matters in March II because, according to the rules, when there are two plenary sessions in the same month, there can be no urgent matters in the second.I question this interpretation. In fact, this interpretation refers to the double sessions in September and, prior to that, in October, during which the budget was discussed. The fact that there are two sessions in March is due to the elections; it is a totally exceptional case. This means that we can only deal with human rights issues at the end of April, which is too late.I therefore ask the Presidency, first, to examine this question and, secondly, to express our immense concern about the case to the Chinese embassy - I can provide you with Mr Gao Zhisheng's case for this purpose - as nobody really knows his whereabouts and there are fears that he may be tortured and his life put in danger."

"transcript": "PERSON122 : author. - Mr President, before we vote on the resolution I tabled on the accession process for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I wish to make three technical remarks so that everybody can decide on the correct texts.First remark: where it speaks about the Macedonian negotiator in paragraph 12, the text should be 'the negotiator of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'. This is entirely in line with what we decided on when voting on my reports of 2007 and 2008.Second remark: in paragraph 18, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is the official name of the biggest religious community in the country. This is mentioned in order to distinguish it from the Serbian Orthodox group. This use of the word 'Macedonian' cannot be replaced by any reference to any state name. As it is the official name of an institution, I propose surrounding the name with inverted commas.Third remark: as regards the translation of the word 'pending' in paragraph 10 in the phrase 'pending full implementation of the key priorities of the Accession Partnership', the French and Italian versions - at least - differ from the texts in English, German and Dutch. For all final translations I propose using the original English version.\nPERSON124 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, in paragraph 12 we had Amendment 1 by Mr Swoboda, on which a roll-call vote was requested and, as you know, Mr Swoboda withdrew Amendment 1 today. I would therefore ask that a roll-call vote be taken on the second part of paragraph 12.\nPERSON126 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to propose a deletion of one part of the text, so the new text of the second part of paragraph 13 should read: 'in view of the new round of negotiations announced under the \"Nimetz process\u201d, expresses the hope that all governments in the neighbourhood will support the integration of this country in the EU, thus contributing to the stability and prosperity of the region;'.\nPERSON128 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to say first of all that I do not think it is fair that, when I withdrew my amendment, you rejected part of my original text.

"transcript": "PERSON289 : Mr President, I propose an oral amendment to recital B, which would add the wording 'on disputed ownership'. I can read the whole thing out if you want. It reads: 'whereas this eviction was carried out on the basis of an order issued by the Israeli Supreme Court on 16 July 2008 following long and controversial legal proceedings on disputed ownership before Israeli courts and authorities'. Otherwise it does not make any sense as regards what the controversy is. One has to actually specify what the controversy was in law.\nPERSON290 : Clearly forty Members have not stood to oppose the inclusion of this oral amendment.I shall therefore submit recital B as having been amended orally.\nPERSON291 : Mr President, in order to have more support for this recital, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Mr Tannock's oral amendment. It is just to add the word 'apparent' before 'disputed', so that it reads 'on apparent disputed ownership'. Then Mr Tannock will be satisfied that we have put the subject matter in the recital, and we will leave the matter open.\nPERSON292 : Mr President, I am afraid that I do not know the Rules in precise detail, but I do not think you can submit an oral amendment to an oral amendment literally in the Chamber unless the whole House agrees. I, personally, do not agree with that, and, I suspect, neither would most of my group.There is no such thing as an 'apparent' dispute: a dispute is a dispute. It went before the courts and that is the verdict. But I wanted to explain what the dispute was all about.\nPERSON293 : I have been advised that the precedent is as follows: where there is an oral amendment to an oral amendment, if the first person who tabled the oral amendment accepts the second oral amendment as a consensus, it is taken into account. If the second amendment to the first amendment is not accepted by the author, it is not put to the vote.I am therefore sorry, Mr Matsakis, but we cannot take your amendment into account.However, Mr Tannock's amendment was not rejected, because forty Members did not stand and I am therefore obliged now to submit it.\nPERSON294 : Mr President, I am sorry but I am not completely familiar with the Rules. Can we not simply vote? We cannot avoid voting because we do not have 45, or I do not know how many Members necessary. We cannot avoid voting because that is the requirement when you leave. Surely we can vote on the oral amendments? Can we just vote on the parts on disputed ownership and then see if it has the majority or not?\nPERSON295 : That is exactly what I was about to propose. We shall therefore vote now on recital B, as amended by Mr Tannock.(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)- Before the vote on recital D\nPERSON296 : Mr President, I am sorry to have to do this again but on recital D I am suggesting once again an additional two words in order to ensure clarity in law, because some of the interventions earlier suggested a certainty. This is not the case so the full recital would read as follows: 'emphasising the fact that the eviction took place despite international objections; whereas the US has raised the issue with the Israeli authorities; whereas this decision may pave the way for the takeover of 26 more houses in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, with 26 other families targeted for eviction; having regard to the political ramifications of this matter for the future status of East Jerusalem'.It is very clear. You cannot say it 'will pave': it 'may pave', and we need that to be in the hands of the courts, not in the hands of debates as enunciated by some of my colleagues earlier on.\nPERSON297 : Mr President, I am afraid that I would like to oppose the oral amendment by my learned friend, Mr Tannock, based on evidence that, in fact, has been supplied by Mrs Galit Peleg, First Secretary of the Israeli Mission to the EU. I have here an e-mail she has sent to many Members, including, I suspect, Mr Tannock.The first line states: 'during Ottoman Empire rule, two Jewish NGOs bought the land and built the buildings in the neighbourhood', which means the whole area, thereafter - not just one house but all the buildings in the neighbourhood. I have it here, if anybody, including Mr Tannock, wants to have a look at it.\nPERSON298 : I would remind you, Mr Matsakis, that there is only one way to oppose an oral amendment and that is to stand up, not to start a debate.I confirm that forty Members did not stand.\nPERSON299 : Mr President, you thought we were in complete agreement and that we understood each other, but I had a different question. I understand that we cannot avoid voting on the amendment because we do not have sufficient Members, but surely we should be able to vote on the parts proposed by Mr Tannock? That means that we should vote only on the text 'may pave' and only when that has been done should we decide on the rest of recital D. It is a bit strange that, just because you do not have 45 people here, you have to include something which might not have the majority of the House.\nPERSON300 : It pains me to have to explain our voting mechanism to you yet again. If a majority votes against recital D, as amended orally, we revert to recital D before the amendment. If, therefore, you wish to oppose this addition, you must vote against. If there is no majority against, recital D will be taken as adopted as orally amended. The only way for you to get rid of an oral amendment which you do not like is to vote against now, because I am opening the vote.(Parliament agreed to accept the initial oral amendment)\nPERSON301 : (FR) I have one brief remark, Mr President, which I should like to be recorded in the Minutes.This is a joint resolution which we have taken the trouble to debate in a highly conciliatory manner. Everyone made concessions. Unfortunately, I see that, with the oral amendments which it is entitled to make and through separate votes, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has seriously changed its tenet. I wonder, therefore, if the procedural representatives who made the compromises have a real mandate from their group and I shall bear this in mind in future negotiations.\nPERSON302 : We shall of course take account of your statement, which shall be included in the Minutes.\nPERSON303 : Mr President, just very briefly, I would like to congratulate the PPE-DE Group because they manage to get the majority of their Members in this House on a Thursday afternoon and get what they want on breaches of human rights issues. I congratulate them.\nPERSON304 : Mr President, I simply want to ask you to put on the record my objections to the abuse of the oral amendment system here this afternoon.\nPERSON305 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that it is very sad that compromises are made and then not abided by, and that it is very sad particularly when you think that the al-Kurd family is not just a name, but people who are forced to live - and here I am addressing you, Mr Casaca - forced to live not even in a tent, because they are not even permitted to remain in their tent. It truly is a sad day when Members think not about this group of human beings but only about politics.\nPERSON306 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Matsakis for his fairness. All the groups have already made use of oral amendments, which are very important in urgent cases, because errors can arise rapidly and sometimes need correcting. This is what we have done in this case and the Social Democrats, the Greens and all other groups have often done the same. It is important not to become offended simply because you did not have the majority on one occasion.\nPERSON307 : (PL) Mr President, I agree with the view that the Rules of Procedure have today been abused. Nevertheless, the Rules of Procedure work, and the rule requiring 40 objectors is a rule, even though we know that we can never comply with it on a Thursday afternoon. I wanted to ask you, Mr President, what is your view and whether you think that we should change a rule requiring 40 people to object to an oral amendment when there are so few people in the Chamber that there is no way this can be achieved?\nPERSON308 : (PT) Mr President, I must say that respect for the human dignity of whoever it may be, in this case the al-Kurd family, whatever religion they may practice, wherever they may come from and whatever colour they may be, is my primary concern. I find it profoundly offensive that someone has called this into question simply because I have a different opinion from that person about a specific legislative act.\nPERSON309 : To sum up this interesting exchange of views, I propose that this afternoon's incidents be transmitted to the competent bodies so that we can see what needs to be done.As far as I am concerned, I have applied our existing rules this afternoon calmly and as pedantically as possible. I think that, as several Members have pointed out, the problem would not arise if our benches were a little fuller on Thursday afternoons."

"transcript": "PERSON124 : Mr President, my report is in line with all the previous documents on multilingualism, whether they came from this House, the Council or the Commission.The alternative tabled is an attempt to bring into the European Parliament certain nationalist disputes that are ongoing in Spain. Just yesterday the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that the Spanish Supreme Court decided three months ago that a box should be included on pre-enrolment forms asking parents in which language they want their children to receive their education, and also that the Catalan authorities are not complying with this decision.The signatories of the alternative do not want this right to be recognised for parents in countries with more than one official or regional language.They do not want to recognise the vital need for education in the mother tongue, not only for educational success in general but also in particular for the learning of other languages.They do not want to ensure full mutual intelligibility between the languages spoken in a country in this situation, especially in relation to senior citizens and to the legal system, health, administration and employment.They do not accept that, in these countries, one language should not be promoted at the expense of the rights of speakers of another language or other languages.This contradicts everything that this Parliament and the other European institutions have upheld.As a result, paragraphs 11, 12, 14 and 17 of my report are omitted from the alternative. Looking at these paragraphs, such negative positions clearly clash with our fundamental rights and freedoms and patently infringe the principle of subsidiarity.My report does not attack or harm so-called minority languages. It respects these and recognises their value, but it also tries to lay down general and basic principles.This House cannot be an instrument of extremist nationalism nor of regional or local hatred or aversion. It is our responsibility as MEPs that is at stake. I therefore urge you to vote against the alternative and in favour of the report that I have authored.\nPERSON125 : - Ladies and gentlemen, please may I have your attention for a moment. There is a request to speak and there may be others. Knowing their contents as I do, I take it for granted that the statements made just now by the rapporteur will not have the support of some Members, but, as you know, provision has only been made for the rapporteur to take the floor for two minutes; there is no provision for opening the debate.I am therefore unable to give the floor and re-open the debate; I can only do this if there is a request to speak on a point of order in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. If we are talking about a point of order, then Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3 has the floor. Do not think me rude if I take it away from him as soon as I realise that it is not a point of order on problems relating to the Rules of Procedure.\nPERSON126 : Mr President, this is indeed a point of order. I will not enter into a debate, but the rapporteur has just said something that does not correspond to what is going to be put to the vote. He said that the alternative motion deletes four paragraphs of his original resolution, and that is not true: there are just changes in their numbering. Of the four cases he quoted, only one is not in both resolutions. That is a statement of fact. The other three are in both resolutions.(Heckling)So this is a point of order concerning clarification. Members are voting on what he asked them to vote. There is just one case, which has nothing to do with the Spanish Supreme Court, that is different in both resolutions. As the rapporteur's statement was not correct, I think this constitutes a point of order.\nPERSON127 : Thank you, Mr Guardans Camb\u00f3. We shall now proceed to the vote. Amendment 1 is put to the vote. Voting will take place by roll call. The vote is open.\nPERSON128 : - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to ask whether it was not considered ridiculous that a person's report can be stolen and an identical one presented in its place, when, under the old system, amendments were tabled. For this reason, I invite you to review our Rules of Procedure, as they are causing an incredible amount of confusion and officially allowing an injustice to be done.\nPERSON129 : - I shall take responsibility for raising this matter again in the Bureau, even though you know that some regulatory powers are taken away from the Bureau and exercised via coordination of the group chairmen, but whoever's job it is to decide, if it is ridiculous, it will remain ridiculous, it will certainly not change."

I wish briefly to tell my fellow Members that we are at the end of a very long negotiation. This is a very sensitive topic, and I would like to avoid the same thing happening as with the subject of alcohol, on which Parliament did not give an opinion.In this case we are considering a price increase from a health perspective among others, but we cannot be so fanatical as to introduce a price increase that certain Member States simply cannot sustain, or that would increase smuggling, especially in Member States on the periphery.Therefore, I ask everyone to vote responsibly, and to consider a moderate, but definite price increase above the minimum level. Consequently, I would ask that you follow the voting suggestion I made regarding this matter, and which, after a certain compromise, was adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Accordingly, I ask all my fellow Members to act responsibly and in such a way that we may, with a large majority, be able to give an opinion to the Council on this much-disputed question."

"transcript": "PERSON110 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I will be very brief. On my advice, the Socialist members of the Committee on Culture abstained during the final vote on this report.As rapporteur, I was rather unsatisfied with the outcome of the votes on the amendments. Many of our fresh and pioneering ideas were voted out by other political groups. In my opinion, an own-initiative should be a brave - sometimes even provocative - document, free of the old dogmas. I planned to abstain, and to call on my comrades to abstain, in the plenary vote as well, but my wise and tolerant female colleagues convinced me that this would not be a good idea and that a watered-down report is better than nothing. So I would ask the House to support the report in its present form, in the hope there will be a chance to improve it in the future."

He is being prosecuted for an article, whose author is known, and, according to Belgian law, as acknowledged by the report, in this situation, the head of the publication should not be prosecuted. What is more, the prosecution is based on the fact that the foreign identity of those who desecrate graves has been revealed. It was brought on the initiative of Belgian socialist councillors.It is clear, and this is my last point, Mr President ...(The President cut off the speaker)\nPERSON133 : Mr Gollnisch, I apologise, but no debate on voting of this type is permitted; I gave you the floor for one minute to illustrate the request, but you have spoken for longer, and we cannot open a debate.(The request for referral back to committee was rejected)"

Our voting order lists always contain the abbreviation PSE/PPE-DE. Alphabetically things are quite different. Is there some procedural rule that explains the natural pre-eminence of the socialists?(Heckling)\nPERSON147 : Mr Rack, I am pleased to be able to answer you in real time, because the administrative services tell me that the indications of those who have signed amendments received jointly from the political groups are transcribed in the voting list exactly in the order of signing indicated by the groups.

Vote against the report; by doing so you will be voting for the Commission, which has made a good proposal.(Applause from the right)\nPERSON140 : It seems to me that the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, is clear, regardless of whether it is shared.

Mr Le Pen repeated in his leave to speak that the existence of the gas chambers in Auschwitz was a detail of world history. With reference to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure, which describes how members of this House must behave here, I ask Parliament's Bureau to check if such a statement is permissible in a chamber of deputies, which is bound by a spirit of reconciliation and understanding and respect for the victims, especially of Hitler's Fascism.

"transcript": "PERSON127 : rapporteur. - Madam President, I know how attached colleagues are to their lunches - or should that be the other way round, I am not sure - but I want to take just two minutes.On Monday evening we had a very important debate on whether or not we can give assent on CARIFORUM. The Commission and the Council - and it is important that both institutions made these commitments - promised us that, in terms of aid promises, they would deliver on the quality of the aid and in a timely fashion. They assured us that nothing in the EPA would affect the Caribbean countries' access to medicines. They assured us that the application of the most-favoured-nation clause would not in any way impact on South-South trade and that the five-year review at the end of the first phase of this EPA would be a genuine review that would take into account development objectives.On the basis of these promises - and on the condition, of course, that these are now written into the record of this Parliament and that both the Council and the Commission promise to honour and obey these commitments - I believe that this House, with a massive majority today, can now give assent to the Caribbean EPA.I would like to thank Commissioner Ashton for her immense cooperation on this, the flexibility that she has shown, and her commitment. The fact that she is here for this vote says much about her. This vote was scheduled for Tuesday. I know she gave up vital commitments to be here today and she has made vital commitments to this Parliament. I want to thank the Commission for their cooperation, and ask Members to vote for assent.\nPERSON128 : - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a point of order. I should like to quote from the letter which President P\u00f6ttering sent to me as chairman of the Committee on International Trade.

[...] The proposals concerning the two EPAs [i.e. the reports by David Martin and Erika Mann] were formally announced and referred to your committee [i.e. the Committee on International Trade] only at the sitting of 19 February 2009. In the light of the above interpretation, it will no longer be possible to apply Rule 47 in relation to those two procedures, nor to any further procedures.'(DE) Therefore, all references in official documents to Rule 47 have to be deleted. This relates both to the cover sheet of the document and to the table of contents, to the opinion page and to the procedure page, the last page of the Committee on International Trade. I should like this to be recorded in the minutes.\nPERSON131 : - Thank you Mr Markov. In fact I had to inform the House that there is a corrigendum to all language versions of this report deleting the reference to Rule 47. What you have stated will therefore be dealt with.

"transcript": "PERSON057 : We will now proceed with the debate on the first ten years of economic and monetary union and future challenges. In that connection, I would like to wish the Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, a very warm welcome to the European Parliament.(Applause)It is, of course, also my pleasure to welcome the competent Commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia.\nPERSON058 : rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Commissioner, I believe that this is an important moment, and the theme that we are going to debate today greatly affects Europeans as a whole.I believe, and everyone is convinced of it today, that the euro is our greatest capital, our best investment. It is now time to assess matters, but through an assessment in a crisis period we clearly need to find the means to get things moving again. What kind of situation would we be in without the euro? Without the euro, Iceland would today be more or less like Ireland, or, rather, Ireland would resemble Iceland.We have re-opened the debates in this crisis because everyone has realised just how central the euro was to our ability to withstand events not just in ordinary times, but also in times of crisis.Commissioner, I should like to thank you for your sense of anticipation, for when, in May 2008, in this House, you put this document on the table, no one realised just how useful and necessary it would be, or how it would underpin vital work aimed at looking ahead to the future and at being able to tackle the crisis facing us on the basis of this solid foundation that is the euro.However, I am fully aware that, in your discussion with the ministers for economic affairs and finance, they suddenly had their minds on other matters, they suddenly had their minds on matters to which they were not paying attention: those of the financial markets. You must remind them that, if they want in the future to emerge from the crisis situation we are in, they will not get away without doing two things.They will have to balance Economic and Monetary Union. We have seen it done to manage the crisis on the financial markets. We are seeing it being done today to manage the crisis in the real economy with which we are faced. Monetary policy can do a great deal, by injecting liquidity to help the markets operate, and by lowering rates to try to revive investment. But that is all! After that, it is up to the governments to take action to save the banks, to drive out toxic products, and, in the future, to revive economic activity within the European Union.It is therefore time that the ministers for economic affairs and finance used the Treaty, which tells them to regard their economic policy as a policy of common interest. On this basis, Commissioner, relaunch the debate at Ecofin, demand this road map that you have suggested to them, and realign yourself with us on the basis of the proposals, of our proposals, that you will have endorsed so that, in future, the euro really serves growth and employment.With regard to monetary policy, of course, we respect the independence of the Central Bank, but we also respect the Treaty as a whole, and Article 105, beyond price stability, stipulates that the Central Bank must pursue the Union's other objectives. Need I point this out? Need I say that, tomorrow, we may open a new debate, as well? Is it not necessary, this is not in our report, but will it not be necessary to open a debate on the inclusion of a financial market stability objective in the monetary policy objectives? I put the question to you.Clearly, we will not make progress with the operation of Economic and Monetary Union if we do take greater account of the relationship between the real economy and the financial markets. We are paying the price today for having forgotten this.On enlargement, this crisis is re-opening the conditions of the debate, but I believe that we need to remain rigorous. Reform prior to entry into the Euro Zone is easier than reform after entry into the Euro Zone, even though this is extremely demanding. Commissioner, you made this a key point of your report: the idea that the differences that have emerged in the operation of the Euro Zone are a cause for concern. They are greater than we first thought.Therefore, we, the European Parliament, call on you to provide the European Union with tools enabling it to observe the quality of public spending in order to see how the Member States react, and to ensure that this is not just a debate on thresholds, one that allows only a general debate and not a debate on the quality of public spending, which is the responsibility of the ministers for economic affairs and finance.In the road map that you are proposing to us, we also believe, Commissioner, that you need to address the Member States today to ask them to review their plans. Their national reform plans do not take account, at present, of the latest forecasts that you have put on the table.If we are to take the joint economic policy coordination exercise seriously, these plans now need to be reviewed on the basis of the growth forecasts that you have put on the table and that have been backed up and confirmed by the IMF and the OECD.Lastly, of the proposals that we are formulating, I would draw your attention to the issues at stake in terms of the external representation of the Euro Zone. For too long we have adopted a passive attitude. The euro protected us. However, in addition to protecting us, it now has to enable us to be a player with a strong voice on the international stage, so that we are not just the floating link in a debate between the other major monetary powers. We are a major monetary power, we must accept the consequences of this in full, and this is also a matter for a consistent, concerted debate within the Council of Ministers.We, the European Parliament, are more than willing to play our part in this exercise, as you know.\nPERSON059 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome the representatives of the Euro Zone, the Prime Minister and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs. Taking stock overall, I think we can say that, in its first ten years, the euro has been an unqualified success. It did not all go completely smoothly, but, particularly during the recent crisis in the financial markets, the institutions have proven their worth. On the basis of institutional cooperation within the Euro Zone, decisions could be drafted quickly, implemented promptly and, in particular, act as examples for all 27 Member States.We have presented a report containing 62 detailed points, including an assessment of the past and prospects for the future. Mrs Ber\u00e8s has already talked about certain points concerning the outlook for the future, and I would like to expand on them. Behind all the positive responses to the euro, there is still the question of what is to happen next. Are the Euro Zone and the European Central Bank prepared for the forthcoming challenges? There will certainly be one challenge or another that will need to be analysed. I would like to remind you of the differences in the development of competitiveness in the Euro Zone, because the secret is that, although we have a central monetary policy, we have local budgetary and financial policies. The Stability and Growth Pact can only act as an anchor between these two levels if the Member States are prepared to stick to the pact, to accept the conditions and to demonstrate the necessary discipline. The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore now facing its first big test, in the form of the handling of the financial crisis. In my opinion, it has the necessary flexibility, and there can in any event be temporary exceptions in extreme cases, but the Stability and Growth Pact cannot be just set to one side.The other question is what is to happen next with regard to debt. The package for the financial markets was wrapped up quickly, the governments took action, and there was a demonstration of an ability to act in a crisis, including by the Commission, but the question is, are we now going to cast aside the principles that have contributed to the stability of the euro, or are we going to succeed in developing and maintaining those principles?On top of that, we have made myriad proposals that, due to the short time I have surprisingly been given to speak, I cannot and will not enumerate. The fact is, though, that we need a more authoritative and unified external representation of the euro - in which respect we fully share the position taken by the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup. I was amazed that Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, was not invited to the most recent summit in Washington. I can say that quite openly, because it is such a contrast with all the positive developments. Naturally, we also want the European Parliament to be appropriately involved, and there is one item on the agenda that we have been debating for a long time, namely the issue of whether it is enough to increase coordination of budgetary and financial policy or whether - as France believes - it is not enough and we need, instead, to provide an institutional form of 'economic government', which is so controversial in Germany. Which is the right path to take? For my group, the answer is clear: we do not need economic government, but we do need greater coordination, including with regard to the agreed policy mix. We also, however, need the Member States to show the necessary discipline, otherwise the euro may find itself in difficulties over the long term, and nobody wants that.Many thanks to all those responsible. Parliament is prepared to cooperate closely, and we are sure that we will be able to set the tone with this report.\nPERSON060 : Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must, on behalf of the Commission, thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen, and all those who worked on this excellent report.The quality of this report on the tenth anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union is to be congratulated. The cooperation between the various political groups, in a demonstration of the high degree of cohesion within this Parliament, should also be congratulated. This is yet another asset and another positive element of this Economic and Monetary Union, both in its present and in its future.This Economic and Monetary Union has existed for ten years. That was the starting point for our analysis and also the starting point for the report produced by the Commission. It was also the starting point for the Commission communication that I had the honour of presenting to you on 7 May. However, the tenth anniversary of the euro and Economic and Monetary Union has coincided with an exceptionally difficult and complex economic situation. This allows us to analyse this Economic and Monetary Union in terms of how useful the euro, our single currency, our sign of integration, can be in tackling such a situation, which we have never experienced before.The conclusion is that the first ten years of the euro have been very positive. In terms of the usefulness of Economic and Monetary Union in tackling the current situation, the conclusion is also positive. We are living through difficult times but we have in our hands an extraordinarily useful instrument to tackle these difficulties.Obviously, the conclusions of the analysis in our communication that I presented here on 7 May and the conclusions of your report must be put into practice so that this instrument can be usefully applied at this moment in time. I agree with the two rapporteurs that coordination is a key element.At the meeting in Washington this weekend, there was also talk about coordination. Without coordination, we cannot tackle this situation effectively. No one can solve their economic problems in such a situation as this without coordinating their economic policies. This was evident a few weeks ago when we had to confront the risk of collapse in the financial system. It is also evident now that we are having to face the prospect of a recession in most of our economies, and when we are, for the first time in our lives, even facing a risk of deflation.Budgetary policies must be coordinated. The report on Economic and Monetary Union talks about the need to increase budgetary surveillance, to expand the way in which fiscal and budgetary policies are coordinated, as Mr Langen said. However, we must also bear in mind sustainability, as Mrs Ber\u00e8s mentioned, the quality of public finances and the fact that we have a system of rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, which was revised in 2005. This revision is now proving very useful, because at times of economic recovery it allowed us to move forward with fiscal consolidation. The euro area ended 2007 almost breaking even - for the first time in its history, with a deficit of 0.6-0.7% - but this means that we now have sufficient flexibility so that our fiscal policy can really help to sustain demand, as our monetary policy should also do.The conclusions of our report are particularly useful now in terms of the need to link budgetary policies with structural reforms and, in this respect, I agree with Mrs Ber\u00e8s: we must review and adapt the national Lisbon programmes, the national reform programmes, and we must also review the stability and convergence programmes of the Member States and adapt them to the current situation. We will be discussing this in coming months and, for this reason, as you know, the Commission will, on 26 November, present an action plan incorporating objectives, instruments, policies and commitments. This plan will indicate the need to adapt the national programmes in order to unite national policies and make them convergent and consistent with a European strategy, policies and instruments. I agree with you and with the report that we must reinforce the external dimension of the euro and of Economic and Monetary Union.As Mr Juncker is well aware, we must have a strategy in relation to the multilateral organisations and the other main parties whereby we can defend our interests in terms of our currency and our Economic and Monetary Union and thus defend the economic interests of the European Union.This strategy must be based on principles and priorities, and also on instruments for taking action which will allow us to speak with a single voice, thus reinforcing the influence of each and every European and, in particular, of the euro area. This is also an issue of governance. I totally agree with many of the governance aspects that you have included in your report and I hope that the Finance Ministers in the Ecofin Council and in the Eurogroup will also agree.Mrs Ber\u00e8s - I am about to finish - said in her speech that the Commissioner and the Commission should once again draw the attention of the Finance Ministers to the conclusions of this report. There is a Moli\u00e8re character who said that he thought he had been speaking in verse, but had in fact been speaking in prose without realising. I believe that the discussions now being held by the Ministers in the Eurogroup under the presidency of Jean Claude Juncker, by the Ministers in the Ecofin Council and by the Ministers at the Washington meeting are discussions which fit perfectly with the priorities and need for coordination reflected in the Commission's report and in your report, although some of them are probably not aware of this.(Applause)\nPERSON061 : President of the Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ber\u00e8s, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating your two rapporteurs on the report they have submitted to you and to us, since we are reading it and we are debating it. This report is fair and goes far enough to ensure that we will be kept busy during the coming months.I agree with the analysis made in Mrs Ber\u00e8s's and Mr Langen's report on the assessment of the first ten years of the single currency. There is nothing to add or to remove from what they have expressed in their report. Furthermore, it is a report that has the support of a large majority within this House, at least where the Commission has expressed its opinion on it. I note that the House's enthusiasm for the single currency is far more pronounced today than it was 12 or 13 years ago, even 10 years ago, and we should be pleased about that.With regard to the economic divergences, the deltas between structural reforms and the differences in terms of the management of public finances, I should like first of all to point out that I did not understand what the report meant when it said that the results do not live up to the expectations that existed at the time of the introduction of the single currency. I know of no quantitative report on the divergences between the various Member States of the Euro Zone. Given that this report does not exist, it is therefore a circumstantial comment, which I did not understand. I do share the view that these divergences tend at times to increase, something which, until now, has not threatened the cohesion of the Euro Zone but, were this divergence to persist, could harm its cohesion in the long term.For the rest, and in this regard, we should be pleased that Europe - the European Union in general and the Eurogroup in particular - which is today faced with one of the most serious crises that it has had to tackle over the past few decades, has competently managed the crisis in which we currently find ourselves, not least by avoiding making the mistakes that were made in Europe during the 1970s. To say that we have not repeated the same mistakes is no small thing, for economically and politically, this has enabled us to prevent the crisis from increasing the divergences within the monetary Union and from helping to undermine its cohesion.The fact is, in the face of a crisis of the size that we are experiencing and in the face of a crisis that is increasingly extending to the real economy, a strong and coordinated economic policy response at European level is necessary, and we need to reflect on the best way of organising it by taking account, on the one hand, of our conceptual and regulatory framework - I am referring here to the Stability and Growth Pact and to the Lisbon Strategy - and, on the other, of the seriousness of the crisis, the consequences of which are far graver than we imagined a few months ago.The creation of the world's second major currency certainly brings advantages, but it also entails obligations, with the G20 of last Friday and Saturday in Washington reminding us of the obligations of ourselves and others. We have to use and make the most of the three weeks we have before the December European Council in order to skilfully hone our European strategy and to prevent disparate responses at national level. These disparate responses threaten us, of course. It moves me to hear the calls and renewed calls for economic policy coordination that are mainly expressed in the language of Voltaire.I should like those who are calling for the coordination of economic policies first and foremost to set an example and demonstrate the sincerity of their words. I note that the various governments of the various member countries of the Euro Zone are pouncing greedily, and justifiably, on the problems being faced by their countries' automobile sector. I should like those who talk about the automobile sector and who continually talk about the coordination of economic policies to coordinate their national actions when it comes to taking initiatives in the automobile sector. The rest is of trifling importance. Really coordinate and prove, with an example to hand, the sincerity of those words.(Applause)With regard to monetary policy, you know how timid I am, I would never utter a word about it, except to say that I continue to believe that the role played by the European Central Bank over the last few months was truly exemplary.Integration and supervision of the financial markets - that is another area of considerations that your rapporteurs have covered in their report. The G20 has set us an ambitious road map; it must be translated into concrete action by the G20, and hence by the European Union and by the members of the Eurogroup. You will no doubt recall that the member countries of the Eurogroup and those of the European Union were the first to demand that appropriate lessons be learnt from the crisis we are facing, and I do not wish to save my memories of that episode for a later date. For four years we - I am talking about those in charge of the Eurogroup - have kept on repeating to the Japanese and US ministers of finance and have kept on drawing the attention of our US friends both to the risks of their double deficit and to the risks created by systematically underestimating the risks, especially with regard to real estate.For two years several of us, at G7 level and in particular under the German Presidency of the G7, demanded, with a certain bluntness of tone, more extensive regulation of the financial markets. I do not take kindly to the fact that those who rejected this in the past are today giving the impression of leading the European response. The US and UK Governments had all the time they needed to accept the Eurogroup's proposals on better regulation of the financial markets; they did not wish to do so. They should not give the impression today that they are leading the others.On the enlargement of the Euro Zone, I have nothing to say that differs from what your rapporteurs said. I would simply point out that, belonging to the Euro Zone is, of course, an advantage, an opportunity, but that it also entails obligations of which some will have to be met before accession to the Euro Zone is possible.This entirely understandable enthusiasm for the new formation of the G7 does, however, cause problems concerning the external representation of the Euro Zone. We have always appealed, within the Eurogroup, for the European Union and the Eurogroup to have a greater presence at the G20, at the International Monetary Fund and at the Financial Stability Fund. We, at the Eurogroup, were the first to demand a lasting and permanent seat for the Commission at the G20, something that did not prevent the President of the Commission from not claiming the Presidency of the Eurogroup - the consequences of which we shall see later. However, we believe that the European Central Bank and the Commission should be represented on a long-term basis at the G20, as should the Eurogroup, whether it be represented by the President of the Eurogroup, who is modestly trying to lead the finance ministers' work, to which Mr Sarkozy commented that they were unequal, or by someone else. I am not seeking the Presidency of the Eurogroup at minister of finance level for my own pleasure and glory, which is hardly inexhaustible; I am doing so out of a sense of duty. If others think that they can do a better job of these tasks, then let them do so, but they should apply the same intensity to them in the years to come as they give the impression of wanting to do at the present time.For the rest, with regard to the EMU's economic instruments and the governance of our group, I believe that, over the last few years, we have made remarkable progress, but when we debate exchange policy and monetary policy at international level, it is unthinkable that the world's second major currency should not be represented in political and monetary terms by those responsible for managing these two aspects and these two areas of our common policy.If we want the ministers of finance within the Eurogroup properly to manage the economic strand of Economic and Monetary Union, then the various Heads of State or Government need to give their ministers of finance the necessary instructions. In Luxembourg, as you know, this presents no problem whatsoever.(Applause)\nPERSON062 : Many thanks, Mr Juncker, not only for this report, but also for your committed work on this matter as President of the Eurogroup.\nPERSON063 : Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Mr Juncker, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating my fellow Members, Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen, on the quality of their report, and by thanking them for having incorporated the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade.Ten years on from its creation, the EMU should be regarded as a European success story of which we should be proud. No one can dispute the fact - and many studies demonstrate it - that there is indeed a link between monetary policy and trade policy, and that, in this respect, the positive role of currency stability is necessary for the sustainable growth of international trade.Increased use of the euro as an international currency benefits the Member States of the Euro Zone because it enables European businesses to reduce the exchange risk and to increase their international competitiveness.However, although the European Central Bank, by prioritising price stability, has increased confidence in the euro, no one can seriously dispute the fact that inflation is a global reality and that, in an open market economy, this global phenomenon cannot be tackled by means of European monetary policy alone.It is clear that the euro exchange rates have been too high for too long and have had negative effects, not least by constraining exports and by promoting imports within the internal market. Many manufacturers have voiced their concerns in this regard. According to a study that we commissioned within the Committee on International Trade, the ECB's high-rate policy has cost us, over the past few years, 0.5 growth rate points per year.It is in this way that I regret that the Commission has not carried out a more precise analysis of the euro's international role and its repercussions on the internal market with regard to international trade.The monetary policies conducted by some of the EU's partners with the aim of undervaluing their currency unfairly undermine trade. They could be considered a non-tariff barrier to international trade. It is in this context that we are proposing to study the feasibility of a body for regulating monetary differences on the model of what the States managed to create in the trade sphere at the World Trade Organisation.This body, which would come under the IMF, could help to stabilise the international monetary system, to reduce the risk of abuse and to give the global markets back the confidence they need.I support the Commission's proposal to develop common, European monetary positions, by obtaining in the long term a single seat for the Euro Zone within the international financial institutions and forums.Lastly, I regret that the report does not take up the idea of an economic government. Mr Juncker, this is not an issue of sincerity; it is a political proposal for organising our Community instruments.In times gone by, governments would settle major international disturbances with military wars. Today, we are fighting an economic and social war, but instead of having people die, we have people out of work, and we no longer really know who the enemy is.In this context, let us not be na\u00efve and let us work tirelessly to implement European economic and social governance. The latter may certainly not be enough in itself, but it is a necessary condition for the success of a European social market economy.\nPERSON065 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to thank the rapporteur for his comments on the future of the euro and all the associated policy areas, and to say that he has garnered widespread support in the committee.I am also grateful to the other participants, in particular to Mr Juncker, who was the face of Europe at the IMF meeting in Washington and made a very good job of it. We were proud of him, and I would just like to say: do not let the negative discussions discourage you from continuing this very successful work.Ten years ago, I had the honour of speaking about the euro on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and at the time I said, and I quote, 'the euro will be strong, in defiance of the negative comments', such as those from Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, as he was to become, who said at the time that the euro was a sickly premature baby. We repudiated that, and successfully in my opinion.After all, the euro was brought into the world following several years of dieting by means of a strict, consistent fitness policy, and it has been a success. I do not want to go into that yet again. At the time, Gordon Brown was President-in-Office of the Council, and he stated quite clearly back then that the European Parliament had played a major role in the historic process of monetary union. Other players also spoke, including Jacques Santer, and also Wilfried Maartens, who at the time described the countries in the Euro Zone - first 11, then 15, then 16 of them - as the pioneers of a courageous Europe.I believe that we in Europe need courage for the future, so that we can carry on working so successfully and continue to stand up in the world of the other major powers - the USA, Asia and the other world powers - successfully with the euro. The currency reserves held globally in euro are the best possible evidence of the success of the euro and of the Euro Zone.\nPERSON066 : I want to congratulate not only the rapporteurs, but also the Commission on its initiative in preparing this text reviewing the first 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union. It is a strategic text and this analysis was vital.As has been said here today, the euro is an undeniable success. From Lisbon to Helsinki and from Dublin to Bratislava, the euro has proved strong and solid, even during the current severe turbulence. It is clearly vital that the borders of this club are enlarged.However, every day now the solidity of the European project is being put to the test in many other dimensions. As has been said, the euro is central to the functioning of the financial system. However, even the Commission's text clearly points to the fundamental conclusion that neither growth in the real economy nor social or spatial convergence have kept up with this success. On the contrary, the Commission clearly concludes that disparities have sharply increased during the first decade of the single currency.This divergence affects regions in my country, in particular northern Portugal, and also other regions in other Member States. The single monetary policy, particularly the very high exchange rate, has had a greater impact on those regions which are more exposed to international competition and also on those that export most.Today, the crisis resulting from deregulation of financial markets is seriously affecting the real economy and is further worsening the situation of many citizens in many regions. Those regions which are exposed to international competition, those which depend on small and medium-sized enterprises and those in which access to credit is very important are now falling victim to this process and depression is even threatening.The euro's success depends on the trust placed in it by European citizens. The most powerful European countries have already taken steps to stimulate their national economies. We can cite, in particular, the initiatives taken in relation to the motor industry. However, Europe is more than that. It has to be much more than the more or less coordinated sum of national policies. The time has come to make the euro one of Europe's central tools to ensure a robust currency and also a robust real economy. The euro must be accompanied by mechanisms guaranteeing the central objective of achieving social and regional convergence, because, in essence, that is the heart of the European project.The debate on coordinating economic policies in the euro area is now unquestionably more relevant and more topical. However, coordinating national policies is not enough. More needs to be done. Having a Lisbon Strategy that is purely the sum of national initiatives and having a Stability and Growth Pact that puts different amounts of pressure on the various countries using it and subject to it are limitations, to which we can add the limited budget available.Crises generate opportunities. Monetary union can only be maintained if there is convergence in the well-being of Member States and their citizens, regardless of where they were born. How else can we mobilise the people to support the single currency? The Commission must be equal to its own diagnosis and that is why we anxiously await the concrete proposals to be made by the Commission on 26 November to this House and to the European citizens.It is vital that this crisis leads to a new phase in the Union, in which consolidation and strengthening of the financial system are accompanied by real prosperity based on cohesion and a concept of citizenship which is also economic.\nPERSON067 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing the most serious financial crisis in decades, and the European Central Bank and the euro have so far passed the litmus test of this financial crisis with flying colours. The ECB has acted quickly and decisively to deal with the crisis, and has done its job better than some other central banks; it has thus given an impressive demonstration of its crisis management abilities in difficult times. The euro has shown itself to be a strong currency, which has helped to keep the Euro Zone stable and has even been able to give a helping hand in the form of target measures to certain countries outside the Euro Zone.The call for European economic government fails to recognise that much has already been, and is being, done to coordinate the policies of the individual Member States and to harmonise them. The achievements in this area can be credited, not least, to you, Mr Juncker, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank you most particularly.Countries outside the Euro Zone, such as Denmark and Hungary, are currently learning the hard way how expensive it can be not to belong to the Eurogroup and not be shielded by the protective umbrella of the euro. Countries that have previously been opposed to joining the Euro Zone, such as Denmark and Sweden, are now changing their minds and considering joining in a few years.The financial crisis also shows how closely linked the financial systems are, and how vulnerable they are. It is therefore in our own interests for the countries that have not yet reached that stage to join the euro as soon as possible, and for the opt-out countries to change their minds, albeit not with concessions that do not fit in with the accession criteria. The European Economic and Monetary Union is a stable area with clear accession criteria, and this should not be watered down. The only thing that might be worth considering would be, with regard to the rate of inflation, not to use the three best countries in the European Union as the reference point, but instead to look at the Euro Zone as a whole, given that we are now a larger club with 16 members.Since the Stability and Growth Pact was revised a few years ago, it has been flexible enough to respond appropriately, in times of economic imbalance, to challenges such as those of the current crisis. It would therefore be a mistake to try to weaken and redefine the requirements of the pact.The crisis also makes it very clear that excessive deficits such as those seen in the USA are not sustainable in the long term, that economic development on credit on a massive scale does not work, and therefore that there is no alternative to measures for consistent budget consolidation. We are confident that, contrary to what is currently being said on the financial markets and peddled in the media, the financial crisis will ultimately strengthen, rather than weaken, monetary union.\nPERSON068 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen for the work they have put into this very important report. It is an excellent report and one that should be taken notice of.When this topic was first reported at committee level, we were experiencing a very different economic climate. The subprime crisis in the United States of America had emerged, but I do not think anyone foresaw the repercussions and the extent of the effect it was going to have on financial markets right across the world.As the financial situation has worsened, the tone of our debates here in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has changed. The current crisis is a global one, and to get through it we need a coordinated global response, so I very much welcome the initiative that was taken at the weekend and the outcome of that. There is a lot of more work that needs to be done, but I think that is a very good start.For Ireland, the stability brought about by the euro currency, notably as regards interest rates and foreign-exchange rates, is a key factor in enabling us to emerge from the turmoil, not unscathed, but certainly still standing.If there is still anyone in Ireland or elsewhere in the Euro Zone or elsewhere in Europe that doubts the benefit of euro membership, just look at the north-west of Europe and take note of what is happening in Iceland.If people in Ireland had listened to those who opposed not just the Lisbon Treaty but also the Maastricht and Nice Treaties, where would Ireland be now? We would be outside. We would not be in the Euro Zone and we would be very badly affected economically because we would not have the stability which the euro has brought to the country.I do not expect an answer from those parties like Sinn F\u00e9in who have consistently opposed Europe and the steps we have taken, but I really believe that it is time that they stood up and said what exactly they think and where they stand on the whole issue of Europe and our economic future.\nPERSON069 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I should also like to thank Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen for the important report they have submitted to us. With its 62 paragraphs and 14 dense pages, it provides much food for thought. I should like to take advantage of the President of the Eurogroup's and the Commissioner's presence to share with them, again, on behalf of my group, several remarks that, in our view, deserve to be examined more fully than is the case in the report.The first remark concerns the euro exchange rate policy. I admit that I still do not understand whether or not there is an exchange rate policy for the euro in relation to the other international currencies and whether, at the G20 or elsewhere, there is a discussion about the way in which the United States' very substantial deficits are going to continue to be financed.My second remark relates to the topic of coordination. I believe that the euro is a success, particularly from a political point of view, because it gives the European Union the status of a political power. However, I also believe that its coordination is not working very well, and this, at least, on three points.The first point is the issue of taxation. You know what the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's opinion is on this matter: we are in favour of tax competition within the Union, but fair tax competition. We believe that we are lagging too far behind when it comes to combating tax havens, including within the European Union, and we believe that we are lagging too far behind when it comes to extending the Directive on savings income.With regard to the issue of budget policy coordination - which is the second point - I note that the Member States are all embarking on 'revival' plans. At European level, I hear Mr Strauss-Kahn say, for example, that 1% of the Community's GDP needs to be pledged, a figure that represents practically the entire EU budget for one year. Where do we stand with regard to that point of view? I believe that the coordination effort is not going very well and I also believe that the responses you are providing with regard to the revisited Stability and Growth Pact are neither sufficient nor a match for the challenge awaiting us.Lastly, the third point on which coordination seems to me to be poor and insufficient is the wage policy conducted within the various EU countries. In reality, Germany has built up its strong performance over the past 10 years by practising a wage policy that, in view of the size of the German economy, is responsible for the overall momentum of the Euro Zone. I believe that this presents a problem in terms of the level of internal demand and of the level of wages for a number of job categories, not to mention the problem of job insecurity.On these three points, Mr President of the Eurogroup, I shall expect, from yourself and from the Council of finance ministers that you represent, more ambition for the future, since we are also talking about the challenges to come.\nPERSON070 : on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the introduction of monetary union, Europe finds itself in a major crisis. Banks are collapsing, or are being propped up with billions from national budgets; the market is collapsing, and millions of people are afraid for their jobs and their future.It is not only the market that has failed: the prevailing policy seems unable to learn from its mistakes. We take the view that serious mistakes were made in setting up Economic and Monetary Union. One of those mistakes was the structural separation of monetary and fiscal policy: one cannot create a common currency without at the same time harmonising taxation and expenditure policy, at least in broad outlines. It seems to me that the economic imbalances within the Euro Zone have increased enormously. What we now need is, indeed, better coordination of economic, and in particular taxation, policy. We need effective measures to combat tax dumping; tax havens also need to be closed and movements of capital finally need to be controlled again.The second serious mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the Stability and Growth Pact. In times like these, anybody who thinks that budget consolidation is essential is obviously living in another world: nothing would be more disastrous than responding to this economic crisis, at this point, with obvious saving programmes. The stability pact has clearly proven that it has failed. It should be replaced by an integrated European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development. In our opinion, we need an investment offensive to renew public infrastructure and to improve the lives of socially disadvantaged groups in Europe.The third mistake, in our view, lies in the structure of the European Central Bank itself, which is not subject to any democratic supervision and which has as its sole objective price stability. We would advocate introducing democratic supervision for the European Central Bank, and we also call for the ECB's monetary policy mandate to be adjusted so that, in future, growth and employment have to be given at least the same weight as price stability.The current crisis is also an opportunity for far-reaching reform of the European monetary and financial architecture. This opportunity must not just be frittered away.\nPERSON071 : on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, if we had a common literary reference framework in Europe, I would begin my speech with a quote from a great Swedish poet: The voice of flattery lulls you to sleep: listen to the voice of truth some time. The meter is alexandrine with a caesura. Both rapporteurs make the assessment that the monetary union has been a success. As a result they are helping to create a myth surrounding the euro that is not anchored in critical Western thinking.The truth about the euro is quite different. Firstly, its first ten years have entailed enormous costs in the form of reduced growth and increased unemployment. Secondly, the monetary union has not been tested in hard times until now. Research points to the fact that the effect on the volume of foreign trade could be fairly large, perhaps even 3-4% of GNP. On the other hand, it is apparent that the socio-economic profit from this increase in trade is very modest, perhaps 3-5 per mille of GNP, which is a one-off profit. This negligible increase in prosperity has been gained at the expense of the Euro Zone countries not having been able to conduct an independent monetary and finance policy. Germany went into this monetary union with a heavily over-valued currency and has lived with a high rate of interest and too restrictive a finance policy.The costs have been considerable, and so how is it going now? The story that has been put together is that the countries of the Euro Zone have united forcefully and have led the fight against the financial crisis. As everyone knows, this is a myth. It was the United Kingdom, which is outside the monetary union, and Gordon Brown who took the initiative. The Euro Zone followed on afterwards.\nPERSON072 : Mr President, let me congratulate Mr Lundgren on his remarks and also challenge Mr Ryan of the UEN Group, who tells us that the stability provided by the euro has been an enormous boon to Ireland. If he had been following recent Irish economic history, he would know that the inflexibility of the euro monetary policy has contributed to serious inflationary problems, especially in the housing market, and that the Irish housing bubble has been much more severe than it need have been if Ireland had been able to control its own monetary policy.We were offered great benefits with the euro; we were offered ease of travel, growth and efficiency, and transfers of money between Member States would suddenly become easier. But this has not happened. Yes, we have got the ease of travel, but we have not seen the growth and efficiency, and I believe that it is nearly as difficult and expensive to transfer money between euro-zone states as it ever was.Those of us who had doubts about the euro project have been vindicated. What we have is the wrong interest rate for most countries most of the time. Italy has had the most fearful crisis of competitiveness, with its unit labour costs increasing by 40% compared to Germany. We are told that the euro is a great success because of its strength as a currency. Well, we should go and ask some euro-zone exporters what they think of the strength of the euro. It is doing huge damage to them.The real test of a currency's success is the degree of confidence in the market, and that is measured in this case by the bond spreads between euro-zone states. The last time I looked, the bond spread between Greece and Germany was over 150 basis points. This is not sustainable. It shows a total lack of confidence in the euro from the markets. The question for us is not how long can the euro last, but which Member State will leave first.\nPERSON073 : - (SK) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for a well-balanced report.In connection with this report I will first of all respond to the current problems in the Euro Zone. And despite ten years of positive effects achieved through its operation, the Euro Zone faces new challenges over how to confront the financial crisis and the subsequent economic recession.I would like to contribute by pointing out some of the unsystematic regulatory interventions made by a number of Member State governments in the market under the pretext of sorting out this new situation.I must say with some surprise that the governments of Member States are often encouraged to make certain unhelpful interventions in the financial sector by some of the statements from certain representatives of the European Union, and these often resolve only the peripheral aspects of the situation.This applies in the case of adherence to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, for example, where some governments are already signalling that they will apparently not be sticking to a planned deficit in their public finances and referring in this context to the encouragement of the European Union.The takeover of troubled financial institutions by the governments of some Member States will create a dangerous precedence for the expropriation of private companies in any sector whatsoever who are not willing to adapt themselves to un-systematic regulatory and discriminatory interventions carried out, for example, in the interests of holding down inflation.The large-scale financial interventions in some sectors of the economy, such as the automobile industry, give rise to questions as to whether or not such interventions cause excessive market deformation and also discriminate against other sectors.Without clear and careful coordination and clear rules at a European Union or Euro Zone level, it will be difficult to manage these very challenging processes.In this context, I would like to urge the representatives of the European Commission and the European Central Bank and other relevant EU institutions to take a considered and coordinated position when looking for an optimal solution in these difficult times, when the whole of Europe faces economic recession.In the short-term, excessive regulation and government intervention in the free market may temporarily halt further economic collapse in the EU, but in the medium term they will certainly not bring the boost to development that is so much expected.\nPERSON074 : (ES) Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, Economic and Monetary Union has added a new dimension to the European integration process. Its governance is based on two asymmetrical pillars: monetary union, which is federal in nature, and economic coordination, which is intergovernmental. Both must ensure the stability, growth, fairness and sustainability that our citizens demand.The review of ten years of the euro area is positive. The proof lies in the fact that the euro is increasingly regarded as a refuge and place of security for Member States. However, we need to go further and expand its scope. We need to do this in order to confront the challenges of globalisation, climate change and population ageing, and also the current financial crisis which necessitates improvements in the way we operate. We also need to do this in order to tackle the spectre of recession which is emerging for the first time.The euro cannot simply act as a safety anchor, but must also be an engine that can drive growth. The euro area and Economic and Monetary Union must be capable of responding to these challenges.I must congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and, in particular, thank them for having incorporated two of my proposals. The first was to introduce, in the definition of our monetary policy, together with the economic pillar and the monetary pillar, the need for a financial analysis in order to correctly define this policy. Its definition must take into account the transfer of monetary policy, the development of credit and financial assets, the characteristics of new products and the concentration of risks and liquidity.Secondly, we must take account of the divergences between the Member States, which will increase with the enlargement processes. A 'one size fits all' monetary policy will not in many cases suit the situation of the various countries. It should therefore be adjusted by introducing financial facilities for those countries which may experience contractive effects due to the 'one size fits all' policy, given that the expansive effects can easily be corrected through fiscal policy.\nPERSON075 : (LT) It is said that any crisis highlights all the strong and weak points of economic and institutional structures. I must admit that previously I had little doubt that greater attention to countries in the Euro Zone would create preconditions for the emergence of a two-speed Europe and that developing economies, like Lithuania's economy, would face obstacles to their entering the Euro Zone. But the current events in the financial markets have changed my attitude to the Eurogroup's role and influence on the European Union.It is obvious that the Euro Zone has withstood the first strong wave of the financial crisis. It is clear that the economic downturn can be halted by implementing an economic policy, which is better coordinated among Member States, which speeds up integration and the expansion of the internal market. Those countries, which have remained outside Euro Zone's borders, have suffered more. For the most part we suffered and became victims of the financial crisis because capital is being taken back. That is why sometimes we object very strongly to decisions, which would ease the movement of capital in the countries of the European Union, it is not that we are against integration. As a professional economist, I know that integration processes encourage economic growth. But we would really like the Euro Zone to become a rock, which would beat back the waves of the financial crisis, a rock which we could climb onto and where we could seek shelter from the icy winds.What needs to be done to make the strength of the Euro Zone the strength of the entire European Union? We should certainly avoid proposing a lot of new measures. Commissioner, today I looked through the resolutions, which the European Parliament adopted on economic policy. Now it would have been to our benefit, if at least part of those proposals had already been implemented. There are a great number of proposals and it seems to me that we will not think of anything more. Now we ought to consolidate those proposals.At the moment there are discussions as to whether we need greater state interference or a more liberal policy to overcome the economic recession. I would say that both economic strategies should be used. Above all, what is obvious is that we need a social safety net, where the state offers support and maintenance, so that people who have lost their jobs due to the crisis, due to restructuring, can find a new place in life. On the other hand, we need liberal reforms so that the integration process becomes stronger and creates opportunities for business expansion in the European Union. Here the Euro Zone has a strong part to play.In conclusion, I would like to join my colleagues and say to you, Mr President of the Eurogroup, that we value your work and know how complicated this all is - at least in the European Parliament you have support.\nPERSON076 : (PL) Mr President, a review of the ten years of Economic and Monetary Union should be assessed from an international perspective. The question we should ask is where the European Union has shown its advantages over its main competitors in the world, that is, the USA and Asia. This perspective clearly shows that the Euro Zone balance sheet is in the red. The European Union has been developing more slowly than its competitors. Growth in jobs, and particular the growth in labour productivity has been lower than in the USA, not to mention Asia. This means that the common currency is not fulfilling its fundamental role.Another aspect is the future of the Euro Zone: documents of the European Central Bank and the authorities of the EU are placing increasing emphasis on the need to use the euro as a tool to impose uniform economic policies on the Member States, particularly as regards budgetary and fiscal policies. This declaration is of concern to the more backward countries, particularly the new Member States. How can they develop and close the gap with the old Member States if they are forced into a policy that slows economic growth in all Member States?The main criticism of the European Central Bank is that in striving to make the euro a world currency, it is ignoring the economic problems of the regions and the less developed Member States. It is also failing to take into account social aspects, such as demographic structure and the mobility of citizens.The position of the EU authorities is even less acceptable when it is considered that for many years both Germany and France failed to comply with the stringent conditions of Maastricht, because they knew that this was in their national interests. Furthermore, they were never called to account or punished. Therefore, in my view, what is needed is not to continue the present economic doctrine of the Euro Zone, but a radical change which will help not only to counteract the present financial crisis, but will above all release the energy for every Member State of the EU to develop economically.\nPERSON077 : (EL) Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union contains a series of contradictions. It aims to close a cycle of market deregulation, while in the real economy the prices of goods and services are at an all-time high and unemployment in the Euro Zone is forecast to reach 8.6% in 2009 and 9% in 2010.Developments confirm that there has been no narrowing whatsoever of the gap between rich and poor. The global economic and financial crisis is directly linked to limitations on the state and the policy of deregulation. Furthermore, while we have confirmation that the distribution of wealth has been uneven, the Commission is advocating in favour of the continuing application and levelling effect of the Stability and Growth Pact and a stronger role for the International Monetary Fund.This approach rides roughshod over the peculiarities of the economies of the individual Member States and clashes with the philosophy of different rates of growth in each Member State.\nPERSON078 : (DA) Mr President, this year it is ten years since the introduction of the euro in a large number of countries within the EU. In Denmark we have rejected the introduction of the euro twice after long and in-depth debates, and now it is time take stock and review the situation. We need to look very critically at our common currency. Since July, the euro has fallen by 30% in relation to the dollar after the start of the financial crisis. Investors lack confidence in the euro. The question is, why? Part of the answer is obvious: there is a lot to suggest that the monetary policy pursued within the EU, which only looks at fighting inflation, is not the correct one. The very stringent finance policy that Member States are forced to pursue on account of the Stability Pact is simply not the right one just now. The low rate of the euro in relation to the dollar is a result of there being no confidence in the economic policy of the countries using the euro. We can also say that the financial crisis demonstrates something else - that the euro's 'one size fits all' standard does not hold true. More and more economists are of the opinion that an expansive finance policy should be pursued. If we want to use it as a tool, we need many more individual economic policies than the euro will allow. 'One size fits all' will never fit anyone very well. It will always be a poor fit for everyone.Finally, I have to say to Mr Klinz - who said that we in Denmark would like to join the euro and that our currency is weak - that the Danish economy is as solid as a rock and that we have managed the financial crisis better than the average euro country.\nPERSON079 : (DE) Mr President, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of economic and monetary union, there is really very little to celebrate. We are desperately trying to use a variety of rescue packages to prevent a dam bursting in our financial system, and all we are managing to do is patch up the breaches inadequately. The banks have pocketed billions in government money, whilst at the same time distributing bonuses and profits, and the average citizen has been made a fool several times over: his tax money has ended up on the banks' roulette tables, and in return he is threatened with unemployment and possibly even losses on his savings and pension fund.In the middle of this dilemma, voices are now being raised saying that we finally have to do something to ensure that European companies do not end up in the hands of non-European, for example Chinese, owners. This sell-off of Europe started years ago, with cross-border leasing and other such machinations. What is more, the EMU is in a certain amount of trouble in view of Greece's spiralling debt and Italy's carelessness after joining the Euroclub.We therefore need to ensure that mistakes made in connection with the euro are not repeated by new members, and that no more risky financial games can be played with public money, in other words with the people's money. Not only do we need strict EU-wide monitoring of dubious financial constructs, but we also need to require a solidarity contribution from those who have profited from speculation. Above all, the EU must, in principle, renounce completely untrammelled capitalism, and instead protect its citizens from unbridled greed and the negative effects of uncontrolled globalisation.\nPERSON080 : (DE) Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, Mr M\u00f6lzer seems to have missed the point, as nothing that he said had much to do with the euro.The euro and enlargement are the European Union's most visible successes of the last 10 years. We must, however, also bear in mind that these successes would never have been possible without the Maastricht criteria, the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Central Bank, and without political will and a willingness to take responsibility at European level. We are now talking about cooperation and coordination. It is true that we need more cooperation and coordination, but, for that to be possible, we will need to trust each other more. We need more cooperation and coordination, not least in light of more Europe with respect to economic practices.During diverse crises, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have helped to protect Europe from monetary crises. I would therefore once again stress that there can be no summit without representatives of the Euro Zone and of the European Central Bank. The financial crisis has demonstrated that the euro has helped us to avoid currency speculation, and to prevent it from occurring in the Euro Zone. The reactions in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Hungary very clearly show us what the euro has done for us.My final point, Mr President, is that we also want the European Union to be represented in the IMF, the World Bank and the global financial economy in accordance with its strength. We call on all those who are now clamouring for global regulations to do in Europe and in their Member States what they are demanding that others do.\nPERSON081 : (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Juncker, I would like to begin by giving my hearty congratulations to a mature ten year old and my thanks to both rapporteurs for an excellent report.The last few months have, of course, demonstrated the strength of the euro. Few people believed ten years ago that the euro would be such a formidable success. Some countries, my own included, waited anxiously outside. Some critics probably thought that the euro would not pass the test, just as Mr Lundgren said. But he and the other prophets of doom were wrong. After months of financial uncertainty it is clear that only cooperation in economic matters, with the euro as the linchpin, can provide the certainty that the current global economic systems require. Precisely the fact that it was joint actions that led to an easing of the market proves the strength of the euro cooperation.The euro should be the currency of the whole of Europe. If this vision is to become reality, then the already stringent convergence criteria should not become even more stringent. I therefore think it is wrong to make membership of the euro into an exclusive club with higher entry requirements, which one of the amendments requires.Allow me to say a few words regarding Sweden's position outside the Euro Zone. For Sweden, which has only one foot in the European Union but is still outside the Euro Zone, the advantages and disadvantages are clearer now than ever before, even, I hope, to Mr Lundgren. When the previous financial crisis hit Sweden in 1992, we could ultimately do nothing other than allow the krona to fall. Lessons learned at that time led to our decision to become part of the European family. Over the last year, the Swedish krona has fallen in value against the euro. Now, as the financial crisis is being dealt with, Sweden finds itself outside both the protection offered by the euro and the resolutions adopted and required by the crisis management within the euro group. It is now that small countries like Sweden should realise the value of a common currency. The stability that the euro offers allows the long-range view that is important for a country that is as dependent on exports as Sweden is. Sweden has good economic development, that is true, but membership of the euro would have given us more stability in our monetary policy and have created more jobs, a more stable economy and stronger exports.The Swedish parties should therefore be prepared to review their passive attitude to the euro as a currency for Sweden. Sweden should be a full member of the European Union. It is therefore time that we began to talk seriously in my country about a new referendum. For my part, I am hoping for Swedish membership within five years.\nPERSON082 : (PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to two questions in this debate, questions which in my view cast a shadow on the functioning of economic and monetary union. Firstly, we have the more rapid development of the countries outside the Euro Zone than those within it. In 2002-2007 the old Member States outside the Euro Zone - England, Sweden and Denmark - developed much faster than the Euro Zone countries. GDP growth in these countries was almost double the average in the Euro Zone, and unemployment rates were significantly lower than in the Euro Zone. The differences between the Euro Zone countries and the new Member States are even more telling.Secondly, there is the unequal treatment of countries aspiring to economic and monetary union, and those already in it. The candidates for monetary union have to meet strict fiscal and monetary criteria for two years before adopting the currency, while the two largest EU countries - Germany and France - who are in the Euro Zone, exceeded the budget deficit threshold for the four years between 2002-2005. A change in the Stability and Growth Pact was necessary for these two countries to avoid having to pay several billion euros in penalties for non-observance.\nPERSON083 : (SV) This report praises the EMU. I wonder what there is in fact to celebrate. The Euro Zone is in a recession and unemployment is rising sharply. Several of the large EMU countries no longer meet the basic economic requirements for membership. This alone indicates what a rigid project this is.Five years ago the Swedish people voted against the EMU. However, on repeated occasions I have heard the Commission say that Sweden sooner or later must join the EMU. I would therefore like to take the opportunity of asking the Commission whether you can clarify this once and for all. Must Sweden join the EMU?The EMU requires a fundamental reform. A clear objective for the European Central Bank to combat unemployment should be included. Greater economic flexibility should be allowed. These would represent a few important steps in the right direction.\nPERSON084 : (HU) Thank you, Mr President, I consider the introduction of the euro a success, since we have seen unemployment fall and employment rise, given the stability that lies behind the euro. Further proof has come from the current crisis, for any country that can use this strong reserve currency simply cannot have balance of payment difficulties, whereas others - such as Hungary - are experiencing such problems.However, the Euro Zone has not succeeded in achieving convergence, despite cohesion fund support, and what we should be examining instead are the reasons for this. It is a very strong magnet for capital. Therefore, I suggest that in examining what happened, we should take into account not only GDP but also GNI.I am pleased that the report has included the point that measures should be taken against Member States who have continuously provided incorrect, rose-coloured forecasts - as we know from the events in Hungary in 2006 - and I believe that this is indeed necessary.I think it important that we should preserve the prestige of EU membership. On the one hand, states that are not members of the European Union should not enter the Euro Zone, since this would mean that we could not justify the dramatic efforts made by certain states to become members.The tools of the ECB, particularly during the current crisis, should be used for each Member State, especially as regard liquidity; we should not be selfish in this regard. This gives meaning to the EU's protective shield and to membership in the internal market, which represents a significant challenge, particularly for the less developed Member States. But similarly, we should take this into account in the composition of the ECB Executive Board.The most important consideration, however, is the external representation of the Euro Zone. This is necessary, but each Member State should be involved in conferring the mandate for the external representation of the Euro Zone; external representation should not be an exclusive club, since the EU is a unified entity.Finally, I would like to say that Member States need to enter the Euro Zone as soon as possible, under strict but logical conditions. Therefore, I am pleased with Mr Klinz's reasonable suggestion that the reference countries be limited to the EU area countries. Thank you for your attention.\nPERSON085 : - (SK) In connection with the financial crisis in recent weeks the inhabitants of Europe have seen how the Member States in the Euro Zone are better equipped to cope with large disruptions. People also see this in my own country, Slovakia, which joins the Euro Zone on 1 January.The financial investors and speculators from the currency markets already consider us to be part of the Euro Zone. It no longer pays to speculate with our currency, since we have established a fixed conversion rate. At the same time, the currencies of our neighbouring countries are falling. Speculators see in them a level of risk which they do not wish to incur, due to the crisis on the financial markets. Some currencies have fallen to their lowest levels in years.The adoption of the euro for a small and open economy shields entrepreneurs and inhabitants from fluctuations in the exchange rate. Even the inhabitants of the country with the highest level of employment in the world, Denmark, which has long had one of the highest levels of competitiveness and highest standard of living in the world, have discovered that if they were members of the Euro Zone they would have more favourable rates of exchange and they would be better able to tackle the current global problems. The same also applies to Sweden, of course, which we have been discussing here today. Perhaps now is the right moment for them to reassess their entry into the Euro Zone.The criticism has been raised today by a colleague from my own country that the Slovak government is drawing up measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision. I would like to draw his attention to a resolution of the European Parliament, which recently asked the Commission to propose measures for strengthening the framework of regulation and supervision across the entire EU. There is no other way. That is why a majority of MEPs from various political groups voted in favour of this option.I would like to end by congratulating both rapporteurs for an excellent report.\nPERSON086 : (LT) The Economic and Monetary Union is 10 years old. It is a fine anniversary, but also an occasion to consider how the EU and the global economic, financial and political situation has changed and whether the Maastricht criteria suit current global changes.In 2005 the Stability and Growth Pact was reviewed, perhaps because its requirements had not been implemented by the largest countries in the Euro Zone.In a period of 10 years virtually none of the countries in the Euro Zone had implemented all of the Maastricht criteria.We know that the European Central Bank's inflation target is 2%. If we were to look for this target today, then we would see that it has not been achieved by any EU countries; their inflation this September ranged from 2.8% in the Netherlands to 14.7% in Latvia, and the Maastricht price stability criterion would be 4.5%.If the members of the Euro Zone fail to implement the price stability criterion, how can we talk about inflation stability? Talk of inflation stability began in 2006, when the Euro Zone started to expand. Are we talking about new requirements purely for new Euro Zone candidates? What are the prospects for Euro Zone expansion?I invite the European Commission and the European Central Bank to review once more the Economic and Monetary Union's principles, government, and the Maastricht criteria, asking whether they are being implemented in the current global economic and financial situation and what the future holds for the Economic and Monetary Union and candidates to the Euro Zone.\nPERSON087 : (PL) Mr President, Mr Juncker, you are out of luck, because today's debate on the success of euroland is being held at a moment when Eurostat has announced that a major recession is starting in the countries which have the common currency. This should incline you to self-criticism, rather than to the unbounded propaganda of success. In their report, the authors praise the fall in unemployment, which over nine years has admittedly been just over 1.5%, but forecasts now predict a significant increase in unemployment in the Euro Zone in the coming year. The other side of the coin is less pleasant, and the report does underline this, and that is the very unsatisfactory economic growth and significant reduction in productivity (from 1.5% in the 1990s to 0.75% in the past decade).It is clear that the euro is neither a panacea for economic woes, nor an instrument that by its nature provides faster economic growth and greater prosperity than in the EU countries outside the euro - Sweden, Denmark and Great Britain.\nPERSON088 : (EL) Mr President, there can be no doubt that the birth of EMU and the euro are one of the highlights in the sixty-year history of European integration.This is the first time in Europe and in the world that we have had such a structured changeover to a common currency, without war, without bloodshed, by consensus and through the political will of independent countries which jointly and democratically decided to take this road towards monetary stability. It has been a difficult road, but a road which suited both components in Europe: both those countries which were accustomed to financial stability and continued to pursue the same anti-inflationary policies and the others which, after decades with no financial discipline, found for the first time in the euro an oasis in which they could rationalise and restructure their economic basics.So much for the past. Now, however, we are in a very difficult phase, at a crucial stage in which we must look at the 'E' in EMU. Until now the 'M' in EMU, its monetary components, have helped us to get where we are today, but from now on, without a cohesive, consistent, single European approach to the economic aspects of the argument, I am afraid that we shall find many of our achievements overturned before us.So we have two matters outstanding for the future: coordination rules for European economic governance which will also inoculate the global system over and above the excesses and anarchy which caused the present crisis and, secondly, we need to condemn the economic pandering to the people of all those who want to use the crisis to cast doubt on such important achievements.\nPERSON089 : (PT) I must start by congratulating the rapporteurs on this excellent report. Only the few who are completely oblivious or the many who lack any understanding at all might consider that the euro and its associated monetary policy have not been a huge success for humanity and a great success for the European economy. You only need to look at the vast number of jobs that have been created in Europe during the euro's reign to understand its importance. It also cannot fail to be significant that, in a crisis situation in which the European economy, thanks to its instruments, is reacting more favourably than other regional economies, those who a short time ago were sceptical about the common monetary policy and the euro are now quickly asking to cooperate with and even integrate into the euro area.However, that is not everything and it does not mean that I personally am satisfied with how the European Union has tackled the issues of financial consolidation and financial stability. I have already said in this House on numerous occasions that I am in favour of financial stability and the Stability and Growth Pact, but that I feel that this Pact has not always been a friend to the real economy. Neither this Pact nor the monetary policy has been a true friend to the real economy. The real economy has frequently suffered enormous problems due to an overly conventional application of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.I have never met an economist nor read an economic text book that told me that two, three and sixty, the magic numbers of the Stability and Growth Pact (inflation, deficit and debt ratio), have been scientifically proven. I have never met anyone and I have particularly never met an economist or economic theorist who at any time has said that it is absolutely vital to doggedly maintain this kind of configuration. One idea heavily defended by the Commission and by the more conservative sectors of Europe is that we must have balanced or zero budgets. This is an absolutely absurd idea. At any level of growth, a balanced budget means the total elimination of debt in the future. This is not fair in social terms, nor is it fair in inter-generational terms, and it has no connection with reality and the real economy.\nPERSON090 : Mr President, the Ber\u00e8s-Langen report is an excellent one because what it does is give us the history of the EMU over the last 10 years and say how it should go forward in the future. The euro has been a resounding success: it is the second most important currency in the world; inflation in the first 10 years has broadly been in line with the ECB's objective of 2%; furthermore, it has facilitated travel, trade and employment; and, most importantly of all, it signifies a further step in EU consolidation.The announcement last week that the Euro Zone is in recession now means that urgent action will have to be taken both within the EU and globally, but the one thing we cannot do is blame the euro for the current crisis. While the Stability and Growth Pact rules are well-intentioned in setting down maximum borrowing guidelines for Member States, they did not foresee - and nobody could have foreseen - the current global economic crisis. The current crisis in my opinion calls for flexibility because, unless the credit squeeze by the financial institutions is relaxed, there is every possibility that the crisis will get even worse and that more and more jobs will be lost.I have to say that I want to commend Presidents Barroso and Sarkozy for the manner in which they represented the European Union at the G20 talks in Washington last week. I think they did us proud and I think they did Europe proud.Finally, we must examine how we got into the current crisis and what the causes were. We must learn the lessons and we must make sure that it never happens again. If this means reform - reform of the institutions, reform of the International Monetary Fund - let us do it. If it means examining the operations of the European Central Bank, let us do it. Let us at this stage carry out a forensic analysis and, whatever the crisis that Europe is now experiencing - we do not know how serious it is, where it is going to end up or what the consequences will be - let us examine it forensically and let us put solutions in place.\nPERSON091 : (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Juncker. I share the view that the common currency has been a great European success. For several years we have had low prices and low levels of inflation, we have had low interest rates, we have had transparency of prices among countries, we have had macroeconomic stability - and this is a particular success for those countries which previously had problems with inflation and their budget deficit. I share the view that this is a success.I would like to comment on what my Polish fellow Member said a few minutes earlier, when he said that we have growing unemployment and a financial crisis in the Euro Zone. Unfortunately he has left the Chamber now, but had he stayed, he might have heard a few words of wisdom. Because he ignores the fact that without the euro, Europe would be in a much worse situation than it currently is. This is particularly evident if we look at the situation of countries such as Iceland or Hungary, which are now facing huge economic difficulties. Had they been part of the Euro Zone, their situation would be far better.I would like to say that the long-term success of any currency will be decided by real factors, it will be decided by long-term economic development, and this is lacking in Europe. We should note that in the past weeks the US dollar has strengthened against the euro, evidence that even in an economic crisis investors, or at least the majority of them, believe that the dollar is a safe haven for their investments. That is why we need to create a basis for long-term growth in Europe, which will strengthen the European currency. But this requires reform, it requires economic momentum, and it requires higher rates of productivity.The second point is that I believe that we should review the nominal convergence criteria, and we should ensure that we adapt the criteria to the new conditions, in particular the inflationary criteria and the method of calculating the benchmark, so that they will enable those new Member State economies that are very dynamic to join the Euro Zone.\nPERSON092 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner, as well as the two rapporteurs who produced this report, because I am convinced that the introduction of the euro has enabled citizens to manage their own family budgets more successfully, by helping them to make savings in their spending on goods and services, and not only this.As others have pointed out, we have seen the inflation rate contained at an average of around 2%, as well as the creation of roughly 16 million jobs over these ten years and the reduction of the public budget deficit, which in 2007 - as the Commissioner said - amounted to approximately 0.6% of GDP compared with 4% in the 1980s and 1990s.Moreover, the euro has acquired international prestige and has become an attractive currency even to countries outside the Community, and despite the recent financial turmoil that has dealt serious blows to the world financial and banking system, the euro has undoubtedly attenuated the devastating impact of this financial crisis of global proportions. There is today, however, a danger that the global slowdown in demand will continue to weaken exports and to frustrate the advantage of the discount rate of the euro, which is threatened by the fall in value of the dollar.It is clear that we must look again at making significant adjustments to the basic structure of the euro, in order to put Member States with a below-average GDP in a position to redress their disadvantage. An EMU road map to better analyse economic divergence, drive forward structural reforms and monitor public finances and financial markets, accelerating their integration, is therefore most welcome. All this can and must be achieved little by little as we emerge, and let us hope as soon as possible, from this situation of instability that is currently exacerbating not only the urgent decisions that national governments have to make, but also the confusion into which savers are thrown. Savers' trust must be restored in order to get investments and consumption moving and to improve the overall framework within which we can then act more calmly. In other words, the responsibility must be a collective one, but a concerted effort is required on the part of the competent authorities to judge which reforms to support with rigorous governance and authoritative political leadership.\nPERSON093 : Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen, for a very balanced report that studies the subject from the wide angle. Secondly, I think that when this report was initiated no one thought how timely it would be at this point. I think it is a sign of the EU's ability to respond to global challenges, secure competitiveness and create stability.Without European Monetary Union, both the euro countries and the countries outside the euro would have been far more vulnerable to this financial crisis. Over the past 10 years, the European Central Bank has played a very positive role, and this initiative has ensured very stable monetary policy and economic policy that actually made us able to respond in timely fashion to the crisis and to take proactive actions, not only in the EU area, but globally when it comes to discussions of reform of global financial architecture.I think that this is more than a crisis of a financial nature: it is a crisis of decision-making and the rules of the game. What we need now is a firmer European role for supervision and for the European Central Bank. We need better harmonised regulation for all different financial instruments. We need transparency through proper procedures and, most of all, we need Europeans to be very persistent in unity to advance these policies globally. We have to be united because markets have grown beyond our national states' capabilities, and we need coherent actions nationally, at European level and globally.\nPERSON094 : - (SK) The euro will be the best investment stimulus for foreign investors in the region of Central Europe as well. Therefore, in connection with the introduction of the euro in Slovakia from 1 January 2009, it will be up to the government of Robert Fico how to make the most of this opportunity.The sustainability of inflation and the deficit in the public finances will be very closely monitored in Slovakia and the current Slovak government must therefore continue with the reforms of the previous government of Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda. If this is not the case, Slovakia may have a problem holding down inflation after entry to the Euro Zone.I believe that the Slovak government will take to heart the recommendations of the rapporteurs of the European Parliament and will not saddle the country with future debt. It should not meddle in pension reform in an attempt to obtain the funds of private savers and achieve a short-term improvement in the public finance deficit, it will not pass laws that conflict with the rules of the market and it will contribute to improvements in the entrepreneurial environment.\nPERSON095 : (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union derives its strength from its 490 million or so European citizens. The Euro Zone is a pillar of stability for Europe and the whole global economy. In the Euro Zone 16 million jobs have been created in the last 10 years alone. In the future, the Union will have to respond to the challenges posed by demographic and climate change. An ageing population will cause major problems of a social, economic and budgetary nature. I believe that the free movement of goods, people, capital and services needs to be defended, especially now against the backdrop of the financial crisis and economic recession.Lifting the barriers preventing the free movement of workers guarantees proper, decent working conditions for all European workers and provides an effective means of combating social dumping and tax evasion. I call on the European Commission and members of the Eurogroup to take the necessary measures, along with the governments of the Member States, to lift the restrictions imposed on Romanian and Bulgarian workers. The Euro Zone needs to set an example for the social market economy.\nPERSON096 : (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia and President Juncker for their work in developing this instrument, which is so important. The euro is a solid reality that has protected us in this crisis.Therefore we must press ahead and develop an economic policy to work alongside the monetary policy that has been so successful; a policy for the Eurogroup as a whole, but potentially for the Union as well, precisely because at this juncture we need to undertake an emergency programme to address the forecasted economic difficulties.I therefore believe that a strong commitment is required; we need to embark on a high-impact programme to build energy infrastructure in the Union and to make energy savings. I am convinced that we must do this as soon as we possibly can.\nPERSON097 : Mr President, allow me to make my points in bullet points.Homogenous markets are at the heart of the systemic failure that we have, and if really good operators like Mr Juncker and Mr Almunia cannot bring heterogeneity back to the markets, then we are only putting off failure to a future date. Homogenous markets are at the centre of this problem.Secondly, it was forecast in Ireland that the euro as a currency would be something like a vehicle with no brakes, no steering wheel and no lights. How much they got that wrong! Where would we be in Ireland today if the euro and the European Central Bank were not in place? Why are we not taking greater credit for this? This is one thing that could help us with the Lisbon ratification process.Lastly, concerning the argument about vaccination, parents have the right to decide, but if every parent decides not to vaccinate, then epidemics will rise.I would just say this: no man is an island. Britain may well be an island, but it is time that Britain revisited the question of joining the euro, because we cannot all go our separate ways.\nPERSON098 : Mr President, it has always been economic nonsense for a number of differently performing economies to share the same interest and exchange rates. In addition, the primary function and legal obligation of the European Central Bank is to control inflation, which in the developing economic crisis is the least of our problems.These are the fault lines that will eventually tear the European single currency apart. But Europhiles in the UK are now using the argument that the falling rate of the pound is an opportunity for us to join the euro. A knowledge of basic economics would tell them that this is precisely the reason why Britain should not join.The ability of the pound to find its own value against other countries will be an essential factor in helping Britain to weather the coming economic storm. The United Kingdom needs the European single currency like a drowning man needs a strait jacket.\nPERSON099 : (RO) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mrs Ber\u00e8s and Mr Langen. Ten years are neither a lot nor a little, but they have clearly made a major contribution in consolidating the single market and, at the moment, in creating a shield to protect against financial speculation. I believe that tighter regulation of the financial and banking sector, combined with encouraging investment in research and development, promoting competition and providing financial education for citizens may be much more effective solutions during this time of crisis.I think that the states of the European Union need to show economic and financial solidarity at the moment as intervention in the financial and banking sector alone is not sufficient to stabilise the economic crisis except superficially. I hope, Commissioner, that the effects of the crisis will not have an impact on the budget projections for 2007-2013 as European funds may be able to achieve the desired effects in providing for the Union's sustainable development.\nPERSON100 : Mr President, on the question of Britain's membership of the Euro Zone, I think it has always been the case that Britain has been reluctant to join European agreements at the outset. It has learnt very quickly to regret that decision. We then apply to join at the worst possible moment. Had we been founder members of the Euro Zone - which we should have been - we would have been in a much stronger position today. I look forward to the next Conservative Government applying to join the Euro Zone really quite shortly.(Applause)\nPERSON101 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to make just two comments. Firstly, the euro has passed the test. Without the euro, in this financial crisis we would probably not have been spared speculation that would have gone against entire national economies in Europe. In that sense, then, the euro has passed the test. We would probably be facing serious difficulties - if not an absolute shambles - in Europe if we had not had the euro in this crisis.In my view, two things will be absolutely crucial in future. The euro can only remain stable and make progress against the dollar as a global reserve currency if two things are guaranteed: firstly, the ECB, which has proven itself in the crisis, must remain independent - as has already been argued - and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact must be expanded on. It is already extremely useful in its current form, but it also needs to be applied and protected.\nPERSON102 : Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate. I believe that, from this debate, we can conclude that there is a very broad consensus in favour of the report under discussion, together with very broad support for continuing with the Economic and Monetary Union project and also in favour of our single currency. I am not saying this out of a desire to repeat the reasons given by those of us who supported the creation of Economic and Monetary Union 10 years ago, but due to the analysis of what has happened in that decade and of what we must do now, in these very difficult economic times.Of course, the current problems cannot be attributed to the euro. As we all know, the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie here in Europe or in the euro area. However, it is clear that we are paying the price, as are other industrialised countries, emerging economies and developing countries. This is because, in a global economy, decoupling is not possible. However, with Economic and Monetary Union, we at least have the instruments to tackle the problems more effectively. We believe that we will be able to get out of this crisis quicker if we work together than if each country tries to go it alone.I agree with all those - and there have been many - who have said that the European Central Bank is an institution which, since its creation, has more than adequately justified the trust that we placed in it in the Maastricht Treaty. I believe that it has done its work very well and that this work should be supported, because it is an essential part of Economic and Monetary Union.I also agree with all those who have said that the Stability and Growth Pact should be maintained as it is now, following the 2005 revision, so that we can use the flexibility introduced in that year and debated here on many occasions. This flexibility will enable us to maintain budgetary discipline and the rules of budgetary discipline. It will enable us to anchor the sustainability objectives of our public accounts. However, at the same time, it will enable us to use our fiscal policy in a situation requiring an active policy in terms of taxation and fiscal policy instruments.The fiscal stimulus must be coordinated so that it is effective. Our framework of budgetary discipline makes this coordination easier, but it also imposes limits to prevent the coordination of a fiscal stimulus from jeopardising the sustainability of our public accounts. Thirdly - and many speakers have mentioned this today - we undoubtedly have to reinforce the voice of the euro in defending the stability of our currency and in bilateral and multilateral relations with holders of our currency, with those representing other currencies and, in particular, with the other currencies of the major players in the global economy.This crisis ultimately stems from macroeconomic imbalances which should have been tackled but which could not be tackled due to a lack of effective mechanisms for solving global imbalances. We discussed this in Washington and we must keep discussing it. We can only do this effectively, as Europeans, if we give the euro our full political support and the necessary governance mechanisms so that our interests can be defended, as they deserve to be, through the exchange rate for our currency. I believe that this is the road to take, as stated in the report, as has been said by the President of the Eurogroup, as agreed by the Commission and as, in coming months, the leaders of the Member States will also increasingly agree.This requires coordination, provided that it is the right kind of coordination. It does not mean challenging the independence of the European Central Bank or artificially coordinating economic policy decisions, which must continue to be made according to the circumstances of each country. That is not real coordination. It must be the coordination that has always been behind the economic branch of Economic and Monetary Union, which is coordination serving the objectives of Economic and Monetary Union, in both macroeconomic policies and in the link which must exist between macroeconomic policies and structural policies.When we in the Commission talk about coordination, we are talking about this type of coordination. I feel that, in the current circumstances, the risk of recession that we are facing shows that this coordination is a priority and that Economic and Monetary Union gives us the instruments to achieve this.\nPERSON103 : President of the Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, I shall be very brief, since the majority of those who tried to lead this debate are no longer in the Chamber. Thus there is no need to respond to them.For the rest, I would say that I have been impressed by the broad consensus that has resulted from the European Parliament's debates, since we are almost all agreed in saying that the euro was a success. I am pleased to note that those who belong to the Euro Zone say so. I am pleased to note that those who would like their countries to become members of the Euro Zone say so too. I note that those who have always said that everything we do is utterly stupid maintain this view, which cannot be characterised any differently from the way in which they characterise our attitude. Consequently, within Parliament, there is nothing new, except to say that, a touch of anxiety - that is a polite way of saying it - has all the same filtered into our debates. This is caused by the financial and economic crisis that we are facing at the present time.On this point, I should therefore like to say two things in response to a number of speakers. No one in Europe is radically arguing for an excessive budget consolidation. No one. We have a reformed Stability and Growth Pact. Some Members of this House did not agree with the reforms that we made to this Pact. They are the first ones today to commend the wisdom of the decisions that were taken in March 2005, when we applied a more economic perspective to the interpretation of this Stability and Growth Pact. This perspective allows the Member States and their budgets to breathe more easily today, even though we are entering a phase that is not depressive, but that makes the consolidation of public finances less straight forward.The Member States that have been virtuous in terms of budget consolidation over the past few years have sufficient budget margins to enable them to react to the current economic crisis, which includes the structural aspects that we are facing at present. The Member States that were less virtuous are having greater difficulty in releasing the budget resources that would enable them to react to the crisis that we are experiencing right now.However, throughout the Euro Zone, we have a duty to react to the crisis where economic policy is concerned. It is not enough to talk about budget stability. It is not enough to devote our efforts exclusively to the financial crisis. It is clear that the Euro Zone has to provide a strong and coordinated response to the economic crisis. We therefore have a few weeks in which to gather together all the elements we need in order to analyse and take action, so that we can formulate this practical and strong response. However, all those who are demanding greater coordination of economic policies must of course work towards this by trying not to anticipate economic policy decisions that they have not referred to their colleagues within the Eurogroup.It is easy, within Parliament, to call for the coordination of economic policies. I would propose to you, on the basis of your Rules of Procedure, that you put forward an intergroup text, in which the large groups, acting as the European Parliament, call on the Eurogroup and on their respective national governments no longer to announce economic policy measures before they have referred them to their colleagues from the Eurogroup.Urge your governments - it is easy to demand it here - urge your governments to respect the principle of coordinating economic policies. Make an intergroup resolution, and we shall see. We shall see, in two, three, four months' time, whether the governments - and the political parties to which you belong are very often part of the governments that you would address - have done what you demanded of them. That would be credible, reasonable, logical, rational and consistent.I am therefore saying that we need a strong and coordinated economic response to what is becoming more and more of an economic crisis. And, on the subject of wage policy, we will not say everything that we want to say, but everything that is worthy of being said.You are right in saying that the socialist governments of the Greens in Germany have practised a wage policy that has reduced the purchasing power of German workers. The situation has improved since then. The same comment applies, moreover, to France, whose government was not, at the time - between 1998 and 2002-2003 - a reactionary one. It was quite the opposite, from what I understood. A little self-criticism, of course, would enrich the comments of certain people in a good way.For the rest, on the taxation of savings, we are three years ahead of the timetable on which we agreed. You are absolutely right, Mr Jonckheer, to call for the expansion of the range of financial products that are due to fall within the scope of this directive. With regard to tax havens, you will converse in the language of your country with your own government and you will discover that you have work to do.\nPERSON104 : rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate. I believe that it is a sound contribution from the European Parliament to what we are expecting you henceforth to implement, Commissioner, Mr President of the Eurogroup, through a road map.Mr Juncker, you said to us: 'If only the groups would come to an agreement!' Well, the groups are going to come to an agreement: tomorrow, they are going to vote for a paragraph 61(d) and 61(g), in which they demand exactly what you are calling on them to demand. Therefore, you can count on this tomorrow when you go and meet with the ministers for economic affairs and finance.You said to us: 'There is no report on divergence'. There may not be a very precise report, but one thing is for certain: convergence of economic situations within the Euro Zone, which we expected, has not taken place, and Mrs Ferreira has given you a concrete example of this.On the contradictions between the Member States, Mr President of the Eurogroup, again, I cannot share your view. I have no time for those who demand coordination when it suits them and who then reject it and advocate national sovereignty when it suits them better. Issues of economic policy coordination are issues of common interest, and the situation we are in today is unacceptable: on the US side, it has already been possible to implement two Paulson plans, while, in Europe, you tell us that we still need a few weeks to find something to say to the people of Europe, who are awaiting our responses. We all need to join forces, and the Commission has in its hands today the means with which to progress on the basis of the European Parliament's proposals. I hope that we will be heard and supported.\nPERSON105 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to start where the prime minister left off. I believe that the flexibility shown by the Euro Zone and the 27 Member States in recent weeks is a very good start. It now needs to be developed further, and I have no doubt that, if the experience you have both brought to bear here is also accepted by the Member States, we will be on the right track.I would like to thank everybody for their contributions. Mr Hoppenstedt quoted from the first debate on the euro, in which the euro was called a premature baby. Today, 10 years on, it has become a strapping young boy - the euro is a boy in my language, whereas the German mark was feminine - who got good marks all through primary school and is now going into secondary school. It remains to be seen whether he will continue to make it over the obstacles, but I am reasonably optimistic that he will succeed. When I hear from Mr Beazley that even the Conservatives in the United Kingdom are seriously considering joining the euro, that is quite a new perspective. All I can say to all that, of course, is that even the United Kingdom will not be able to join the euro for free: you will need to meet your obligations regarding the coordination and regulation of financial markets and comply with the necessary minimum harmonisation.In that sense, we are on the right track. I would like to thank the Commission, and particularly Mr Almunia, and the President of the Eurogroup for their excellent cooperation. We will take you at your word regarding your suggestions. We want to work with you.(Applause)\nPERSON106 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday 18 November 2008 at 12 noon."

"transcript": "PERSON123 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I know that I will not be popular for making a long speech at this time, but my two fellow-rapporteurs, with whom I have worked very closely as a team, have made short statements so I want to keep the team spirit together.I would just like to say that there are more amendments in my report because my committee has been more ambitious in the improvements it wanted to make to the Commission proposal. I ask for your support to ensure that we have confident, well-informed consumers for electronic communications, who are also secure and know that their personal data is protected.I would like to thank all my colleagues on the committee who worked with me to put together some really big compromise amendments which we will pass today. I would like particularly to thank Alexander Alvaro and the Civil Liberties Committee, with whom we worked very closely, for their part on the E-Privacy Directive. I would like all of you to give us a huge majority for this so that, when we come to negotiate with the Commission and Council, we will do our very best for Europe's consumers.- After the vote:\nPERSON125 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work. It was not easy: they have worked miracles and they have my respect. I would also like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the strong signal they have given with today's vote. This is the signal for an open and competitive single market, for telecom companies and for Europe's 500 million consumers alike.Yesterday the Commission had to propose new rules to tackle excessive charging for SMS and data roaming in the EU. These proposals will provide a fast cure for one of the most visible symptoms of the lack of a single market in telecoms, from which both companies and consumers are suffering. Today, the European Parliament has gone an important step further by proposing to remedy the problem once and for all at its root: to get rid of the fragmentation by paving the way for a single market in regulatory terms.I welcome in particular the fact that the European Parliament voted, after an intense debate - and probably to the surprise of many observers - for the establishment of an efficient European telecom regulator, as a facilitator for bringing together the national regulators, and for the dialogue between the national regulators and the Commission. This is good news in the interest of a level playing field for the provision and use of telecom services across borders in Europe. This new European regulator will make a strong contribution to enhancing cross-border competition and consumer choice.Now, honourable parliamentarians, we need to sit together - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - in order to get this telecoms package up and running by 2010. There is not much time left. We have to do it substantially; we have to do it quickly now. Everything the Commission can do in order to help to advance will be done.I am convinced that the signal given today by Parliament goes beyond Europe: it is a signal that will be heard across the globe. It will show that the single telecom market in Europe is open for business in the interests of a strong industry and of an empowered consumer. Thank you and congratulations.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON006 : It is with great sadness that we have learned of the dramatic events in Kauhajoki in the west of Finland, where 11 people have lost their lives in a very tragic incident at a school. A number of people were also seriously injured by the perpetrator, who then turned his gun on himself.On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the families and all the relatives of the victims. All the victims were innocent young students at a vocational training school, where they were studying for careers in the service sector.This tragedy occurred less than one year after a similar appalling killing spree at Jokela High School. As we all know, Finland is regarded as one of the most peaceful and safest countries in Europe, so we can understand that the people of Finland are speechless with shock, and we share their distress.Unfortunately, we often see similar patterns repeated in these acts of bloodshed. In this instance, although the perpetrator posted threatening videos on the Internet before the killing spree, it was not possible to avert the tragedy. As responsible politicians in Europe and in all the Member States, we must do our utmost to ensure that such acts of violence are detected and prevented in time.Once again, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims and their families."

"transcript": "PERSON096 : rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we are about to vote on the Telecoms package, one of the most sensitive proposals of the closing period of this parliamentary term.My fellow rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera and Mr Harbour, and I have worked together closely to achieve a coherent and efficient proposal for the end-users of these directives, namely the Commission and regulators, but one that is also positive and valuable to those looking for legal certainty, encouragement for investment, and a dynamic and balanced market, that is, operators and their employees, as well as for the primary beneficiaries of the numerous services and quality at a fair and accessible price: the consumers.All of us - rapporteurs, draftsmen and shadow rapporteurs - were united in these aims and that is why we were able to reach a solid compromise, attested to by the small number of amendments on which we are to vote.I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the rapporteurs, the chairmen of the committees responsible and committees asked for opinions, their secretariats and all the political groups. I also wish to thank the colleagues that have shown an interest in this matter and contributed to our work. I now call on my fellow Members to support their rapporteurs and draftsmen through their vote and to grant them a clear and decisive mandate for the period of codecision that will follow.Finally, I hope that the Commission and Council will respond positively to Parliament's amended version of the package, which, although it represents in many regards an alternative to the Commission's initial vision, still presents as many areas of agreement between our three institutions.- Before the vote on Amendment 132:\nPERSON098 : (DE) Mr President, with reference to Amendment 132, on behalf of the signatories, I wish to withdraw this amendment, as regrettably, our efforts in this House to achieve a compromise which strengthens copyright have been unsuccessful.- Before the vote on Amendment 138:\nPERSON100 : rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, we have a relatively difficult decision with regard to Amendment 138, for which three requests for a split vote have been tabled. I personally tabled an oral amendment to the first part of the amendment, which is included on the voting list and reads: 'applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end-users'. That is the first oral amendment. Since then, we have been looking for a solution acceptable to the political groups in relation to the third part of the amendment.I therefore propose a new oral amendment, with the backing of the signatories, including the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler, and others, which would read: 'save when public security is threatened where the ruling may be subsequent'. This would replace the third part and clarify matters, as the third part proposed by Mr Bono is ambiguous as regards the exception. By making this clarification, we have a readable and acceptable amendment. Incidentally - for the benefit of Mrs Hieronymi - it has nothing to do with intellectual property, as she was saying.(The oral amendment was accepted)"

The negotiations now beginning must reach their conclusion within this parliamentary term. I believe that this is therefore decisive for the sector."

"transcript": "PERSON019 : The final draft agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 3 June 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been requested to this draft.Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday: No change.Thursday: The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the first sub-item of the debate on human rights in the afternoon, 'Allegation of mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir', be deleted from the agenda.The Chair of the PSE Group, Mr Schulz, has the floor to explain the request.\nPERSON020 : Mr President, I had already tried at the Conference of Presidents to convince the chairs of the groups that this agenda item is totally inappropriate at this particular time. It is based on mere supposition by Amnesty International. According to Amnesty International itself, there is a suspicion, but no tangible proof of the existence of these mass graves as yet.The Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Mrs Flautre, responded to this very intelligently. She invited representatives of Amnesty International to visit the committee on 16 July to substantiate and define the accusations. Therefore we believe that it makes a lot of sense to wait until this hearing has taken place before we decide what to do about this agenda item.In addition, I should like to point out that this is not just any old region but a part of the world in which the European Parliament too, as an international political entity, must proceed with scrupulous care, and not make decisions based on assumptions that could perhaps trigger the opposite of what we intend, which is to achieve more stability in the region.Therefore, we request that this item be removed from the agenda.\nPERSON021 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, in the debate that we are going to have - I hope - we will be asking for an independent inquiry into the mass graves, for those sites to be protected and for an end to the harassment of the people carrying out this inquiry. I think there is absolutely no contradiction between this request for an urgent debate on the issue and the hearing that Mrs Flautre is organising for 16 July.\nPERSON022 : (DE) Mr President, how can a roll-call vote be requested on a motion I have tabled, when I have only just tabled the motion?\nPERSON023 : Mr Schulz, when you are planning something, word gets around fast, so I assume that everyone got to know about it quickly. However, I believe that, if the motion is before me, I must hold a vote on it.\nPERSON024 : (DE) Mr President, based on the Rules of Procedure, I think that is impossible. My group decided, about 25 minutes ago, to assign me the task of tabling the motion. Therefore, I think it is utterly impossible for a request for a roll-call vote on the motion I have only just tabled to have been submitted in the meantime. If it has been submitted, then it was not submitted within the deadline, and it is within your discretion to reject it.\nPERSON025 : Mr Schulz, I have been informed that this motion was tabled an hour earlier, from which I conclude that it was done as a preventive measure. That is my hunch, anyway, Mr Schulz. Why is it such a problem? You have your conviction, others have theirs. Let us all have our own convictions. According to my information, an hour ago - on time, in other words - a proper request was made for a roll-call vote, should it come to a decision.(Heckling)You can each decide whether to bring your documents or not - it is up to the individual to choose.\nPERSON026 : (DE) Mr President, I request that the sitting be adjourned for two minutes until all the Members have obtained their voting cards.\nPERSON027 : We shall have a short break so that everyone can get a card.(The sitting was adjourned for a few minutes)(Parliament rejected the motion by roll-call vote)\nPERSON029 : (DE) Mr President, you mentioned first that it is very pleasing that Minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet is present - as indeed it is. Will you be calling on future presidencies to follow Mr Jouyet's example and attend Parliament from the Monday?\nPERSON030 : (EL) Mr President, a very brief comment about our programme for Thursday: the French President, Mr Sarkozy, is coming here to present the issue of Europe's future, in view of a very serious crisis in Europe.The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as far as I know, has only 18 minutes to speak. I imagine the President will be given only a very few minutes, and the other speakers even less.The European Parliament is the place par excellence where MEPs should speak and national leaders should hear them. With the time allocation as it stands, I think we have lost a very important opportunity in this discussion.\nPERSON031 : Mr Lambrinidis, there is a proper procedure for distributing the Minutes. It is no different on a Thursday from any other day, and it is your group's task to allocate the group's speaking time as it sees fit. Everything else is done according to the d'Hondt system, and nothing out of the ordinary is planned for Thursday."

"transcript": "PERSON075 : The next item is the report by Jutta Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2009 budget: First reflections on the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget and mandate for the conciliation - Section III - Commission (2008/2025).\nPERSON076 : Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what should the budget for the European Union for the year 2009 look like, and what could it look like? We have been talking about this since the beginning of the year, and now we are about to embark on the second step by the European Parliament in this year's budgetary procedure, which is a little different from those of previous years. This is due to the fact that we want to start preparing ourselves in a small way for the amended procedure after the Reform Treaty.After the resolution on the Budgetary Framework and Priorities for 2009 in April comes our resolution 'First reflections on the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget and mandate for the conciliation'. This resolution was adopted unopposed by the Committee on Budgets and I hope very much that the plenary session will also take a unanimous decision on it, especially as the comments and suggestions from the specialist committees have been included in it.What are we concerned with here? The title tells all. We assess the preliminary draft budget with which the Commission has presented us and find much in it to criticise. We do not see that the draft reflects budgetary truthfulness and budgetary clarity, that it is sufficiently transparent. We already know that that the Commission, too, has to cut its coat to suit the limited cloth of the medium-term financial framework. However, that does not entitle it to use creative budgeting techniques to create available margins.Nevertheless, such techniques have been used - for example, the backloading of multiannual programmes; the fact that known and easily discerned needs for financing are not taken into account; and the non-budgeting of the Guarantee Fund estimated at EUR 200 million a year. We do not see that the Commission has reflected in the figures the political priorities it formulated itself in its Annual Policy Strategy. These are priorities that Parliament has vigorously supported, to wit the fight against climate change and the promotion of competitiveness for growth and employment, closely linked with the promotion of a sustainable Europe and of course the realisation of a common immigration policy.Most importantly, we expected greater commitment to the fight against climate change. The Commission claims to have earmarked almost EUR 14 billion in the budget for the environment, but closer inspection reveals that, of this EUR 13.842 billion, EUR 13 billion is already allocated to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. This amount will therefore have to be supplemented.We also need to do more in the area of competitiveness, mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises, but particularly for small enterprises. The first step was the Small Business Act. The 2009 budget should provide a specific SME facility available to SMEs, who must first sue for their debts. It is all very well to have laws that dictate that the 30-day time frame must not be exceeded, but how are SMEs supposed to implement them? Bridging loans under this facility can, however, prevent bankruptcy and job losses, and that is also in our interest.I do not wish to address now the insufficient budgeting to meet the requirements of food aid, food security, Kosovo, Palestine, Afghanistan; indeed, of the whole of heading 4. My fellow Members will do that in a minute.I only wish to tell the Council, whose representative is no longer here, unfortunately - I cannot understand why he would be present for the one-minute speeches but not when we start talking about the budget - that Parliament is fiercely determined to enter into true political dialogue with it. We want to implement the European priorities, and a proper budget is required in order to do this. After all, our European budget is nothing other than politics in the form of figures.(Applause)\nPERSON077 : Today we have a unique opportunity to familiarise ourselves at this early stage with the European Parliament's main priorities for the coming year and to learn what causes concern among MEPs with regard to the project tabled by the Commission. I would like to thank the initiator of this early discussion - the rapporteur, Mrs Haug.May I assure you that the European Commission and I are devoting a great deal of attention to effective financial management and strict financial discipline. We appreciate your constant attention and interest in these matters, ladies and gentlemen.Therefore, while fully appreciating your concerns, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget was prepared by the Commission within the limits of the financial programming period 2007-2013 after thoroughly assessing the economic and social development forecasts and establishing a well-founded, adequate margin that provides for unforeseen challenges.While preparing the budget for the coming year, we tried to make sure that the political priorities were given concrete financial expression and the objectives had a substantial, solid budgetary base. Therefore, the highest financial growth is to be expected from the programmes that encourage economic development and competitiveness, as well as those promoting freedom, security and justice, financed from the corresponding budget categories.With the aim of having a budget for 2009 that would reflect the European Union's foreign policy goals along with the full participation of the Union in international activities, the Commission will, in the very near future, table an amendment to the draft, providing accurate calculations for the financing of Palestine and Kosovo. Even before the preliminary discussions of the 2009 draft budget get under way in Parliament, the Commission will table proposals regarding the supplementary financing of short-term measures in developing countries that are struggling to cope with the impact of the rise in food prices; we are prepared to establish a 'food fund' for developing countries.I have noted your concern about financial expenses, especially those not included under heading 5. You can rest assured that the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget provides sufficiently detailed information from that aspect and we are prepared to provide all the information you require in your resolution.In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her efforts, as a result of which, for the first time, we have a list of new pilot projects and preparatory actions at this early stage. It will encourage a timely assessment of the possibilities for their financing and facilitate the efficient implementation of projects approved by Parliament.Already next week - this week, rather - we will be having a tripartite meeting and next week, the first conciliation meeting to prepare for first reading in the Council.I am sure that this year there will be no change in the atmosphere of constructive cooperation we have enjoyed for several years now and we will be successful in reaching an agreement at the end of this year.\nPERSON078 : Madam President, generally speaking, I am far from satisfied with heading 4 of the draft budget.Firstly, I note once again the scarcity of funds allocated to this heading. It is in total contradiction with the stated ambitions of the European Union to be a global player. No only is heading 4 only 1.8% up on the 2008 budget, but this increase is below the average budget increase of 3.1%. It can therefore be said that the portion reserved for external relations and development was cut in the preliminary draft budget.Secondly, I reject the approach chosen by the Commission, which is already proposing to use the flexibility instrument and emergency aid for expenditure that is actually predictable and planned. Accordingly, the Middle East, Kosovo, food aid and macrofinancial assistance are patently underestimated.Take the example of Palestine. The preliminary draft budget this year proposed EUR 171 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 100 million in payment appropriations. Yet in 2007 we spent half a billion on the occupied territories. Now, by July 2008, we have already spent EUR 365 million. What are we going to do next year? Dip into the flexibility instrument? Reduce a margin that is already small?Thirdly, I am concerned about the food crisis that is taking shape and the effects of climate change. If there is one priority for the EU, that is it! In the 2009 preliminary draft budget, the appropriations allocated to food aid have risen by only EUR 6.8 million, the famous 3%, even though at the end of April 2008 the Commission asked for a payment of EUR 60 million extra and it has just asked us for an additional EUR 40 million; it is a joke. I welcome the launch of a Global Climate Change Alliance and a Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, but we need to increase the finance for these initiatives in the 2009 budget in addition to the commitments provided for under development.Finally, I am aware of the importance for the Council of the European Neighbourhood Policy and our cooperation with the Mediterranean countries, but I refuse, as the finance in heading 4 currently stands, to support any additional costs that the EU would incur for the Mediterranean. It is according to these long-term commitments, in areas where needs make themselves felt, that the European Union's external and development policy is judged. Without sufficient resources, the budgetary DIY strategy chosen for heading 4 will give a very poor image of it.\nPERSON079 : All of this is extremely important, of course, and it is good to know that things are in good hands with Mrs Haug. I can say that cooperation with her has been extremely pleasant. I am speaking as rapporteur for the budget for development cooperation, and I agree with those who say that an increase in the budget under heading 4 is urgently needed.However, I should like to draw attention in this regard to two issues that are important from a development cooperation point of view. The first is the food crisis, and the second is a results-oriented evaluation.As has already been said, the food crisis is a major problem, and so we must seek solutions via the budget, both for the short and medium term and for the long term. For the short term, there is food aid. I welcome the initiatives developed by the European Commission in this regard. For the long term, we have, in principle, the Food Security Thematic Programme under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). Unfortunately, however, this is only just getting off the ground and is not quite working as yet. The problem is greatest in the medium term, therefore.Too little attention is being paid, both in the countries themselves and in the EU, to food security and food production in developing countries. We do have rural development, but often this does not benefit areas such as food production, but rather those such as the building of roads.I can understand the proposal by the European Commission to use underspends from agriculture for this purpose. This is very tricky not only in budgetary but also in other terms. Countries who meet their commitment to reserve 0.7% of GNP for development aid will say: let other countries do the same, let them also meet their commitments, then we may be able to do even better. They have a good argument, of which due account must be taken. In any case, it will have to be made clear that the money must truly be put towards food security, towards increasing production, towards helping poor farmers in poor countries.My second point concerns results-oriented evaluation. Criticism is growing in Europe on the subject of development cooperation, even in countries that have always been generous and favourably disposed to development. Madam President, we must go beyond good intentions and carry out results-oriented evaluation. Better effects, better results. This is the way to convince people.\nPERSON080 : draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (SV) Madam President, first a big thank you to Jutta Haug. She has taken a number of the views of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy into account. For example, she has highlighted something we consider important, namely that there is a certain discrepancy between the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy and what is actually being proposed in the budget, for example on climate and energy policy.After all, last year the discussions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the budget were concerned primarily with two major areas, Galileo and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. We now note that implementation in these areas has started well, although of course we will continue to keep an eye on implementation. So this year we can instead concentrate on energy and climate policy.There are many views on these matters in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. In particular, we are concerned at the inadequate margin, 82 million under heading 1A. It is far from sufficient for these important priorities. We understand that the Council, now ahead of the 2009 budget, is endeavouring to increase the margin, among other things by a number of administrative cuts. That is fine - provided it does not create difficulties for the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme - but it does not sound as though it will be enough.Just to give an illustration of the orders of magnitude we are talking about: Mr Buzek, reporting on the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan, speaks of EUR 2 billion per year from and including 2009, just for the SET plan. I do not know whether that is realistic, but it makes the point that the energy and climate policy calls for a substantial amount of new funding.In the Seventh Framework Programme and in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) a fair amount of money is set aside for the energy and climate policy, but remember that those levels were fixed back in 2005, i.e. long before we had any idea of how the 2008 climate and energy policy would look.We are also in the process of starting several Joint Undertakings, among other things to develop fuel cells and hydrogen gas technology. The Commission now proposes 30 million as a first allocation for this. However, it is proposed that the money be taken from the cooperation programme of the Seventh Framework Programme and its energy section. This does not really represent new money; it is just a redistribution exercise.We want to form a complete picture of all the funding for energy and climate policy, because it is almost impossible to do so at present. It must start to be given serious new resources, already in 2009. Besides, we are convinced that the energy and climate field constitutes the most powerful argument for a proper mid-term review of the long-term budget to begin next year.\nPERSON081 : draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, essentially, I can only agree with the statements by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug. They also apply, in my opinion, to the budget available for transport. The proportion of the budget allocated to transport has certainly grown - but that, of course, is due primarily to increases in the Galileo programme. The reasons for these increases are a never-ending story, and have something to do with policies on industry in Europe.The criticism I have to make of the Preliminary Draft Budget before us, however, is that we need more money for passenger rights, as this area concerns the rights of European citizens. Most importantly, however, we need more money for research and for new transport strategies, so that we can finally arrive at mobility that is not detrimental to the climate. Trans-European networks also need very strict monitoring, because large amounts of money are to be spent in this area.\nPERSON082 : draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Haug for a good report.Direct support and market measures are central to the agriculture budget and have their own ceiling in the funding framework. Expenditure remains at EUR 2 027 000 000 below the ceiling at EUR 42.8 billion. This is an increase of five percent.The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development expects that part of this margin could be used on a programme to distribute fruit to school pupils, thus promoting healthy eating habits. Obesity is an ever increasing problem among young people.The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also expects measures to create a restructuring fund for the milk sector. The Committee is concerned about plans for this margin to be used to modernise agriculture in developing countries. Funds from heading four of external measures, and not from heading two, should be used for this.The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also concerned about rural development measures. Last year EUR 2.8 billion remained unspent, so the Parliament will monitor the implementation of the rural development programmes closely.\nPERSON083 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the floor. Mrs Haug's report, for which I would like to express my appreciation and thanks, summarises accurately what the Parliament thinks about the Preliminary Draft Budget. Listening to the Commissioner's speech, I felt that the rapporteur and the Commissioner dovetail together, and this could fill us with a kind of enthusiasm. I have one tiny little problem: Mrs Haug's sentences were worded with a critical edge, and the Commissioner expressed intentions of reassurance. I am delighted by the intentions, but I would also like to see the figures in a format that is consistent with the intentions.I would now like to highlight two thoughts from this complex material. The French Presidency, like us, is interested in a strong Europe, but unfortunately right now it has gone away to build it. A suitable budget is needed for this. France understands Europe and has done a lot for it. We hope that there will finally be an end to the lawnmower-style trimming. The Presidency must be aware that every cent spent on underfunded programmes is a waste of money.The People's Party wants value to be generated from budgetary expenditure, so it is prepared to act in the interests of greater efficiency, in other words against poorly performing programmes, corruption or expenditure led by internal politics.The surplus in the agriculture budget is changing due to the impact of global markets. Many ideas have emerged regarding what we should spend it on. I oppose all sudden, unjustified decisions, whether for the 2008 budget or for the 2009 budget. Furthermore, the Union has serious debts in this area. The twelve new Member States will have to wait ten years before they receive the same support as the old ones. So competition will be distorted in the single internal market for a decade. This unfair situation has come about due to a shortage of money. If it now emerges that there is still money in the agriculture budget, there is a moral obligation to redress this competitive disadvantage.Directing agriculture money elsewhere is an idea that is also supported by some of the leaders of the new Member States, but nobody should be fooled by the pathological compulsion to comply among the post-Communist leaders; it is no longer from Moscow, but from Brussels that they expect the tap on the shoulder.Among other things, we must face African problems too, since aid within the framework of the agriculture budget, in the form of seeds and fertilisers, has a serious reality. Financial assistance can hardly solve a shortfall of products.My group will support the tripartite amendment on climate change, and will wait with interest to find out what lies behind the surprising fall in the level of payments. Thank you for your kind attention.\nPERSON084 : Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week, Parliament is deciding on the political priorities of the budget under difficult circumstances, both internally and externally. We are having to cope with many challenges, while the framework of the financial perspective is very limited. I therefore particularly welcome the courageous political work done by our rapporteur, Mrs Haug. She has managed to anticipate the stages of the budgetary procedure to enable us to determine where our institution is heading. This new procedure provides greater clarity, and therefore greater democracy, for citizens. It has thus been possible to understand and discuss the priorities of the parliamentary committees and political groups.Unfortunately, I must once again deplore the Council's lack of ambition and the systematic nature of the cuts it made to the Commission's preliminary draft budget. We note that its aim is to save money on administrative expenditure. This is not a matter of identifying a political priority but of making technical savings that often double the margin in some headings, as Mr F\u00e4rm said regarding sub-heading 1a. Similarly, I cannot explain the linear cuts made in payments: EUR 1 billion less than the preliminary draft budget.As regards heading 2, matters are clear. In 2008 we left an unused margin of more than EUR 3 billion. For the 2009 budget, the Commission is proposing a margin of more than EUR 2 billion, and the Council is going further by increasing this margin to EUR 2.4 billion. However, needs are plentiful in rural development, and also in energy, immigration, climate change and international solidarity.At a time when the food sovereignty issue is becoming more pressing with every passing day, and when it looks like if we do nothing, eating will become a luxury in Europe, the Council has decided to reduce agricultural expenditure. Even if you have not touched the budget lines within our traditional priority, you have forgotten to increase all those for which you are making promises. Similarly, after the recent failure of the Irish referendum and the French and Dutch referendums two years ago, does it not seem that communicating with and informing citizens are important activities that require considerable investment? By denying this essential need to inform, communicate with and listen to citizens, we are reaping the results of this autism in each consultation and opinion poll.Finally, I will never understand the Council's behaviour when it comes to heading 4. The observation is clear, and is always the same. This heading is dramatically underfunded, so we should not allow promises to be made that will never be kept. How can we hope to solve the problems associated with developing multilateral relations, problems of hunger in the world or the consolidation of democracy, and not propose an increase? You are even suggesting cuts for the policies that are working.There is only one thing we can do in the next few weeks: go over both the monitoring and the writing of each budget line again, but also explore all the possibilities for achieving a budgetary framework that gives the European Union a realistic, unifying budget for 2009.\nPERSON085 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Haug for her cooperation on this report, which my group can support. We can also support a few amendments by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The EU budget is an important political instrument, of course, even if it is a modest budget in relation to the overall economy. The 2009 budget must naturally also reflect political priorities, so is that what we are seeing? The EU Heads of State or Government have adopted an ambitious energy-policy agenda; can these ambitions then be found in the budget? No, they cannot. There are no clear new priorities of this kind. For example, the Heads of State or Government have decided that 12 pilot projects should be devised for coal-fired power stations that capture and store CO2, but no one knows where the funding is supposed to come from. Should these pilot projects not be reflected in the EU budget? I am only asking.The Heads of State or Government want to see an ambitious common refugee policy complete with the adoption of an immigration pact this autumn. What about the ambitions for the border agency Frontex, however, whose task is to help particularly vulnerable countries to manage the flow of refugees escaping poverty? From what we have heard, there is not sufficient money to meet ambitions in relation to this work.Foreign policy is chronically underfunded. This can also be seen this year, when once again there is nothing like a realistic budget for aid to Palestine and Kosovo. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has proposed transferring underspends from the agriculture budget to the areas in which the budgetary framework is too tight. This is the solution we used for the financing of the Galileo satellite navigation system. The Commission, on the other hand, has proposed funding development aid from the agriculture budget. I do not think this is a good idea at all. It is a real mess.My group cannot accept, a priori, that we are now discussing a revision of the financial perspective. In the first instance, it is the Member States' Finance Ministers who must demonstrate how they intend to reconcile the political ambitions of the Heads of State or Government with the ceilings laid down in the budgetary framework.\nPERSON086 : Madam President, Mrs Haug is right to alert the Commission to possible improvements in its draft budget when she talks about the transparency of administrative expenditure, particularly for the agencies, better financial programming and better evaluation of human resources.I am going to focus my comments on a paragraph in the Haug report that points out the lack of correlation between requirements for fighting climate change and the EU budget. Our budget is basically 1% of Europe's GDP, which is derisory in comparison with the 20% of GDP committed by the United States at federal level.The Commission tells us that it is taking 10% of this tiny percentage for climate change - that is to say, 0.1% of GDP - yet the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Stern report, the UNDP and the World Bank are telling us that if we really want to combat its effects, we should be mobilising between 0.6 and 1.6% of GDP. The Stern report even mentions 2% of GDP. The Commission is therefore between 500% and 2 000% below what all these international reports are telling us.Here is another interesting figure: to help the developing countries, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - that again - tells us that around USD 100 billion a year would be needed to finance all these projects. The Commission tells us that this is interesting, that it is going to set up a Global Climate Change Alliance and that it is giving it EUR 20 million a year for three years. There is therefore a massive gap between needs and resources provided. When I say a gap, I mean such a gaping chasm that all the carbon in the atmosphere could be sequestered there.I do know that the Commission has little room for manoeuvre: expenditure is fixed, the envelopes for each programme are fixed, the measures to be financed for each programme and the conditions are fixed and, furthermore, the Council does not want to budge, and worse still, is cutting into expenditure. Luckily the Commission has the right of initiative, if only it would use it! We are within the ceilings of the financial perspective, as Mrs Guy-Quint has said. We have a margin of at least EUR 2 billion. If we do not use this EUR 2 billion margin, it is not simply a charming error of budgetary technique, but a failure to assist a European project in peril, a failure to assist a planet in danger.(Applause)\nPERSON087 : Madam President, Commissioner, at the start of our term of office we were all striving to increase funds for the implementation of EU tasks. Sadly, in accepting the budgetary framework for 2007-2013, the Council did not see any need to raise the level of the EU budget. We are now witnessing the fatal consequences of that decision.Besides the implementation of tasks arising from the Lisbon Strategy, we have seen an increase in other joint actions in recent times. Let me name but a few: trans-European transport networks, the European Institute of Technology, the fight to combat climate change. We have already encountered problems in the funding of the Galileo programme, and now the next set of problems are beginning to appear, on a much larger scale. Why advance lofty aims when we already know that we shall not have the money to fund them? Reducing funds to implement the common agricultural policy and transferring them to finance other tasks will not take us far, and what will become of the programmes that have been launched?My fellow Member Mrs Haug was faced with an immensely difficult task if she was to meet our expectations even in part. I therefore sincerely congratulate her on carrying out this tough assignment, and I hope that there will not be too many amendments.\nPERSON088 : on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, the Commission's budget is very austere.Mrs Haug's report justifiably draws attention to limited margins in many sections. The least flexibility is in section four. It is obvious that the sums to be given to Palestine and Kosovo in 2009 will not fit into the budgetary framework. In principle, it is questionable whether the flexibility instrument can be used for these known needs which exceed the budget amounts for that section.Our group supports the halting of climate change, and we would have wanted this objective to appear more clearly in the budget. Instead, the amounts for security and defence policy that serve the militarisation of the EU do not belong to the common budget, although the Council would propose this, especially now, during the French Presidency.A new situation was created when Ireland democratically rejected the EU draft constitution, and this is having an unpredicted impact on the draft budget for 2009.(Applause)\nPERSON089 : (SK) For the third year in a row, a gap is gradually opening up between the long-term budget forecast and budget reality.Member States' governments are not drawing on budgetary resources sufficiently dynamically and they are consequently whisked away as frozen budgetary resources. The volumes are increasing year on year.On the other hand, the tendency towards a mid-year increase in payments is reducing not only in relation to gross national product, but also in absolute mid-year terms. By accepting this approach, Parliament is creating a softer and less demanding environment for Member States' governments. This will in future be reflected in a lesser degree of implementation of key European Union policies. This situation is worrying and rapporteur Jutta Haug correctly draws attention to this in several respects.I should like to draw particular attention to the continuing relative and absolute fall in expenditure on competition and cohesion policy, which is intended to support economic growth and employment. Such a development does nothing for citizens' confidence in European Union policies. This is not good news prior to the election year of 2009.\nPERSON090 : (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the Haug report presents our first reflections on the Preliminary Draft Budget at a very early stage, and we are combining these with a plenary mandate for the conciliation that will take place on 17 July.Naturally, without the Reform Treaty, some important key points of future-oriented common policy are not yet in place but, even without the Treaty, there is much that contributes to the need to rework the Preliminary Draft Budget: compelling and conspicuous deficits, particularly in foreign and security policy, and the EU as a Global Player under heading 4; and the results expected from the G8 Summit and the conclusions of the European Council on 19-20 June also have to be taken into account.In at least 13 paragraphs, the European Council has in fact presented an intensive programme for revising the multiannual financial programming: the further development of Frontex; Europol; strengthening Eurojust; measures to deal with natural disasters; pilot projects in second-generation biofuels and clean coal technology; funds for agriculture in developing countries, food security assistance and stabilisation; an increase in public development aid of 0.7% of GNP by 2015; trade assistance for developing countries; immigration policy; and new financial resources for dealing with climate change.I am eager to see how the Ministers for Finance, with whom we now have to negotiate, will tackle this series of innovations put forward by the Heads of State or Government and what figures and proposals they will provide to back up the political conclusions of these Heads of State or Government.I want to concentrate on two supplementary elements - I expressly support the overall lines that the rapporteur has produced here thanks to intensive cooperation, including with the specialist committees. If the Commission is now thinking about producing savings from agriculture for a new programme to benefit farmers in developing countries, then people are welcome to discuss where these will come from. However, sneaking a project like that in under heading 2 by creating a new legal basis is simply not on! If the intention is to finance it in that way, taking into consideration commitments we have made, this constitutes a revision of the financial perspective and belongs under heading 4.Secondly, we need considerable further discussion about whether to proceed by simply giving these funds to the United Nations or the World Bank without having access to the internal audits and without certain guarantees with respect to correct political priorities. Given the experience we have had, it is not that simple!Naturally, we know that, for example, we spent three times as much on Palestine in 2008 as is stated in the 2009 Preliminary Draft Budget. Given the new challenges, given the political decisions, the old trick of financing the common foreign and security policy and new priorities at the expense of the developing countries in heading 4 is no longer acceptable and we shall not put up with it.\nPERSON091 : (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the budget is a political instrument, not an accounting instrument, and this report has the great advantage, I believe, of going beyond technicalities and making some political points.The two most important points are, firstly, that the EU budget is not equal to the EU's needs and ambitions and, secondly, that this budget does not reflect the EU's political priorities as specifically mapped out by its other agencies.On the first point, what can we do? What does the report say? We are asking for an increase in the very low level of payment appropriations. In addition - and this is very important; it has been said, but I want to repeat it - we are asking for the best possible use of the margins. In other words, wherever we can avoid wasting money under certain policies to enable that money to be used for EU policies, it is very important that we should do so.On the second point, we can see that the budget, as I said, does not reflect the political priorities. I shall focus on two examples. These have been mentioned by other Members, but I shall repeat them:Over the past political year, what have we found to be the most pressing problem currently facing the EU? Energy policy, climate change, the food supply problem. The sums allocated from the budget to combat this whole raft of political problems are very low.The second issue, as many have said, is external policy. Now that Europe is opening up and spreading its wings, we are once again reducing expenditure.Thirdly, and let me insist on this: communications policy. You see what is happening, the problem the EU is facing in terms of the institutional crisis it is going through. We need political initiatives, and for those political initiatives we need communications and money.\nPERSON092 : (NL) To begin with, I too wish to thank Mrs Haug and the Commissioner. I had also mentioned the French Presidency in my notes, but regrettably its representative has already disappeared.One aspect of this budget that is attractive to Member States is the low percentage of payment appropriations. I believe that 0.9% is one of the lowest percentages we have seen in recent years. It is up to us to consider whether this is realistic or not. There is nothing against keeping the percentage low, but it must be realistic, and we have already heard that we may be faced with a large number of new priorities.One of the things we shall have to tackle - as many have already said - is heading 4. If we look at this heading, one of the main organisations to which funds are allocated is the United Nations. I have just returned from a visit to Kosovo by the Committee on Budgetary Control. The things we heard there about the United Nations did not inspire great optimism. I think that the Commission needs to have another good look at the policy with regard to this organisation.Another aspect is budget heading 5. I believe the margin currently stands at 121 or 123 million. How does this margin look in the light of rapidly rising inflation? Four to five per cent a year. What are the consequences of this for the Commission's expenditure on human resources, buildings and so on, and what conclusions should we draw from this?\nPERSON093 : (PL) Madam President, there are four issues in this debate to which I would like to draw attention. The amount of funds for commitments in the 2009 budget is 1.04% of GNI, and just 0.9% of GNI for payments, which means a fall of as much as 3.3% in comparison with payments in 2008. With such a small budget, it will be difficult to put into effect the priorities drafted by both the European Commission and Parliament, especially as these priorities are distinctly increasing with each year that goes by. Thirdly, the funds mentioned under heading 4, with its characteristic title 'The EU as a Global Player', deserve particular attention, as they are just 1.8% higher than in 2008, even though it has been apparent for years that this is a permanently under-financed area. Fourthly, such a modest rise in funds in heading 4 is all the more puzzling, since it is surely there that we find the funds for EU food aid for developing countries, and the prices of basic agricultural raw materials have risen by several dozen percent during the last 10-15 months.To conclude, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, on a very thorough report that once more demonstrates how both the Commission and the Council sadly approach the process of budget drafting primarily from an accounting angle.\nPERSON094 : (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, we are in the process of setting a clear mandate for negotiations on the discussions we are to have with the Council next week.I understand why many fellow Members who have spoken have pushed for special additional efforts on issues relating to the scope of their powers (external relations etc.), but I believe that this year in particular, this mandate should be set in relation to what citizens expect of the budget, rather than what many of us expect because of special interests or other concerns.We must focus on the four issues that, in my opinion, are now the most pressing issues for citizens in Europe today. These four issues are: high prices, climate change, competitiveness and the environment.These are the four cornerstones on which we should build the mandate: I think we are on the right path, but we must not lose sight of this outline.I would like to say a few words about the idea that President Barroso pulled out of his sleeve yesterday and will be putting to the G8 summit today or tomorrow, if I am not mistaken, on food security. It is an idea that we should examine, but we should examine it from the standard perspective of the way in which we draw up the EU budget: in other words, we should discuss it with the Council as a budget principle and decide whether it should be tabled as an EU proposal in international forums.To conclude, I would like to say a few words about immigration. I come from a Member State that is subject to enormous pressure on its external borders, which are EU borders, especially on its maritime borders. I think we should make a special effort this year as regards the issue of Frontex, especially its maritime dimension, with operations such as Operation Poseidon in the Aegean, which last year alone, in the summer months, was able to respond to an average of 700-800 cases of illegal immigration.We need this effort, just as we need to make a mark, at last, on the budget - and I am in touch with other Members with the aim of achieving this - to ensure that for the first time there will be a mechanism for solidarity between the Member States in handling the administrative cost and the administrative burden of receiving immigrants.This is something which we do not have yet, and which we need. This puts great pressure on some Member States and I think we have a special responsibility to make it work.I shall end as I began. No budget can succeed unless it responds to the expectations of citizens rather than special interests and lobby groups.\nPERSON095 : (SK) My thanks go to Mrs Haug for her excellent report.The draft budget for 2009 on the one hand allows for the consolidation of programmes approved for the financial period of 2007 to 2013 and, on the other hand, puts new emphasis on the need to resolve urgent issues and challenges. In regional policy, it is in our interests to improve the social and economic situation of the inhabitants of underdeveloped regions. Our objective is to reduce the inequality between European regions. In comparison with 2008, payments under expenditure sub-heading 1b have decreased by almost 14 %. We of course wish to be able to face up to the current and future challenges while respecting the principle of solidarity within the whole of the Community. We must therefore ensure that the resources we need for cohesion policy will continue to be guaranteed in the future.In order to be able to convince our citizens that their financial resources are being used responsibly, we must ensure the effective implementation of operational programmes and large projects. The analyses and subsequent measures put forward by Member States will thus play a key role. It will be important to assess the results of cohesion policy for the period 2000 to 2006.\nPERSON096 : (FR) Madam President, first of all I would like to say that I have enormous respect for Mrs Haug, who was passionate in her presentation of a comprehensive, demanding and, at the same time, very brave budgetary report, which was voted through unanimously in the Committee on Budgets and which aims to clarify Parliament's need for transparency and clarity in preparation for the 2009 budget.Naturally, it pinpoints Parliament's main requirements - policies linked to competitiveness, regional policy, R&D, development, agriculture and food safety, and to a lesser extent the requirements in terms of foreign policy and the European Neighbourhood Policy, as underlined earlier.However, in the little time available to me, I would like to stress how important it is, now more than ever, that we avoid sacrificing the appropriations of sub-heading 3b. In the current climate, where there is a lack of public confidence in the EU and Europe is struggling to inspire its citizens, it seems essential that, through cultural, youth and health policies, we can forge genuine European citizenship. I join Mrs Haug in lamenting the fact that it is precisely those activities that help demonstrate what Europe does for its citizens that have been increased the least.Finally, to conclude, I would like to ask the Council and its Presidency - and I too am sorry that the Council representative should be absent at this crucial point in the debate - to avoid making cuts in the Preliminary Draft Budget at first reading, as they have become accustomed to doing in previous years. To that end, our institutions need to work closely together and the European Parliament has to be fully consulted in its role, yes, as joint policy-maker for Europe, but more importantly as the citizens' representative in the key political act that is the adoption of the budget.\nPERSON097 : (LV) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in talking about the draft budget for 2009 prepared by the European Commission, we ought first of all to note that the total amount of commitment appropriations is increasing to EUR 134.4 billion, which is a 3.1% increase. At the same time, the amount of payment appropriations is decreasing by 3.3%, and the amount of payment appropriations for EU cohesion policy is decreasing most rapidly - by 14%. Of course, the reduction in payment appropriations for EU cohesion policy is connected with protracted programming problems hindering the Member States from commencing full uptake of EU funds. The European Commission should, however, have focused more on the successful commencement of resources uptake and reduction of the administrative burden, instead of on a mechanical reduction in payment appropriations. I believe that we will have to give serious consideration to this issue once again at the conciliation meeting. As regards heading 4 of the EU budget, relating to the EU as a Global Player, it is obvious that the amount of resources proposed by the European Commission is insufficient. It is necessary to reconsider the draft of heading 4 of the budget, taking into account the EU's commitments in Kosovo, Palestine and elsewhere, and to arrive at realistic figures. In relation to the EU's new priorities - the EU common energy policy and the fight against climate change - the current amount of EU budget resources for these objectives is obviously insufficient. Of course, significant changes to the structure of the EU budget may be made only in conjunction with the mid-term review on the EU financial perspective, but specific changes may be introduced earlier, such as allowing the new Member States to channel a greater part of EU funds towards energy efficiency goals and home heating programmes. Finally, on institutional issues, the 2009 budget procedure was begun on the assumption that the Lisbon Treaty would enter into force next year. The current situation with the Lisbon Treaty is not very clear and it is important to agree on exactly what procedural changes it will introduce into the work of the institutions on the EU budget. Thank you for your attention.\nPERSON098 : (RO) Supporting the single market is completely justified if we reach a high degree of consumer satisfaction, by safe goods and services, as well as efficient ways to solve the problems that may occur, everything under the conditions of ensuring a loyal competition.The proposals submitted by the IMCO Committee for the 2009 budget follow this direction. We request additional funding for the SOLVIT network that, despite the justified expectation, has not reached the estimated efficiency in solving the legal problems citizens are dealing with on the internal market.We also support the further funding of the projects regarding consumers, market research, including prices, as well as market supervision measures.The data collected may explain the potential distortions and contribute to finding adequate measures for correcting negative situations. We notice that, in most chapters we debate on, the funding is adequate, but we insist with concern on a certain aspect: the current structure of budgetary expenses is completely non-transparent.Thus, the democratic control over the destination of public money is undermined, a fact that the Parliament firmly rejects.\nPERSON099 : (RO) The first report of the European Parliament regarding the preliminary draft budget for 2009 should indicate very clearly the political priorities of the European Union at present.Thus, I consider that the report has largely emphasized the budgetary insufficiencies regarding the fight against global warming, but it has not insisted enough on the problem of the food crisis that European Union citizens are dealing with. The price crisis and the food insecurity we are dealing with for the first time in more than thirty years needs to be part of our budgetary priorities.I think the only instrument by which we can respond efficiently to the situation is the common agricultural policy. This and only this can guarantee sufficient production of food products in Europe.For this reason, I do not agree with the use of the margins available under title 2 of the European budget for other fields and not for agriculture. Secondly, we have seen, for several years, the redirecting by various means of money in the first pillar, from direct payment to farmers to the rural development projects in pillar 2.I remind you that the rural development projects will not lead to a production increase in Europe and, implicitly, to solving the current food crisis.Even if the tendency of applying these transfers by the instrument of modulation has lasted for several years, at present, we need the best measures for the current challenges and these measures are among the traditional instruments of the common agricultural policy.\nPERSON101 : (HU) Thank you for the floor, Madam President. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for the excellent work she has done so far, and for the comprehensive position before us now, as a result of which she is attempting to create a budget from the restricted framework available which can help us bring our priorities to fruition, and at the same time respond to the global challenges we face.In view of the stagflation that is threatening the European Union, it is an important, positive step that the largest heading in the budget is now the section dealing with growth, employment, innovation and cohesion. The sources that serve the goals of climate change and secure, competitive energy supplies can also be found between the lines. It would be even better if there were separate headings for these challenges, namely reducing CO2 emissions, energy saving and renewable energy, thus promoting the development of a common, sustainable, European energy policy. Thank you.\nPERSON102 : (FR) Madam President, following the Irish referendum, there is an even greater need for the EU to listen more to citizens and to keep them better informed about what concerns them on a daily basis, particularly now, less than a year away from the European elections, if we want to arouse the voters' interest in European issues and ensure that a basic consensus is obtained on its aims and policies.This is a difficult time for the 2009 budget, on which Mrs Haug produced an outstanding report with her new approach to the major issues and her wide-ranging consultation. I recall from her report the points made about citizenship and information, which must rise to the various challenges in 2009 and require considerable resources in a heading where, unfortunately, the margin is small.Information is an essential democratic tool. Wherever they live, be it in an old or a new Member State, citizens need to be better informed about the realities of the EU and particularly its budget. To that end, they must be given clear, relevant and concerted messages by the principal institutions. In this respect, calls to introduce a sort of 'European Union' brand that would be identifiable all over Europe and would appeal to everyone seems an important factor in involving citizens in the European project.\nPERSON103 : (PL) Madam President, annual budgets are a kind of compromise between implementation of the strategic aims recorded in multiannual financial frameworks and the current political and economic situation, and particularly the need to act to deal with unforeseen situations that arise in the market.This is the situation we are facing today: there is a steep rise in energy prices, including fuels, and there are clear symptoms of a global food crisis, while at the same time there is a rise in food commodity prices. What actions does the Commission foresee and what budgetary sum can we assign to countering this difficult ongoing situation, to prevent this crisis from worsening?We have spent many years working on an energy and climate package, and this is very important. Is this goal visible in the financial priorities of the 2009 budget, though? Elections to the European Parliament will take place in 2009. We shall have to give account for the disbursement of taxpayers' money and for the extent to which this disbursement is in line with the aims and needs of Europe and its citizens.\nPERSON104 : rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your many kind words, for your appreciation of my work and, of course, for your support. However, you know as well as I do that the work can only be done, and done properly, when all Members pull together on this. Only then are we strong enough in relation to the Council to be able to push through the things that we believe are essential.I particularly liked the way that Mr Surj\u00e1n described the Commissioner and me when he said that we were like two interlocking cogs. I find it a particularly good image because when two cogs mesh, they move something, and that is exactly what we want. We want to set something in motion; we want to avoid a static budget and, above all, we want to move the Council. As the President said, the Heads of State or Government can issue communiqu\u00e9s about all manner of wonderful things at their summit meetings but, in the end, the Commission and Parliament have to get the whole thing moving. Of course the Council is part of it too, as one arm of the budgetary authority, but mostly I get the impression that it is always up to us to drag the Council along with us in this movement because the Council itself does not take the initiative in providing impetus.We have analysed the Preliminary Draft Budget yet again, exchanged views on it and clearly carved out what we want from the budget for the European Union in the next year at a very early stage - before the summer recess. This gives us a good basis on which to move into the preparations for our first reading after the summer recess.I hope that all Members will support it as soundly then as they have done today.\nPERSON105 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, 8 July 2008.Written statements (Rule 142)\nPERSON999 : in writing. - (RO) The Committee on Budgets requests real support for poor regions, asking for a larger budget as an expression of the principle of European solidarity. The Jutta Haug report has in view the 2009 budget detailing, emphasizing current priorities at the European Union level, including the fight against climate change and solidarity toward poorer regions.This new approach should contain a better understanding of the difficulties and needs the poorer regions are dealing with and it is to ensure greater financing, which, by the relevant European institutions monitoring development progresses, shall lead to a decrease in disparities and to ensuring economic and social cohesion.For Romania, this budget change could be good news as regards the financing of development regions, since 6 out of the 8 development regions in the country are part of the 15 poorest regions in the European Union and the North East development region remains the last in this ranking this year as well. Therefore, again we have an important chance in what should be our fight and permanent concern to reduce the significant differences separating us from the regions of the Western European countries, in economic, social, cultural and civilization terms."

"transcript": "PERSON006 : Ladies and gentlemen, after many requests to do so, I should like to make a short statement about the release of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages.Ingrid Betancourt, Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves, Juan Carlos Bermeo, Raimundo Malag\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Marulanda, William P\u00e9rez, Erasmo Romero, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arteaga, Armando Florez, Julio Buitrago, Armando Castellanos, Vianey Rodr\u00edguez and John Jairo Duran were abducted and held hostage for many years by the Colombian terrorist organisation FARC. They were finally released on Wednesday, 2 July 2008, thanks to a successful military operation by the Colombian army.The European Parliament is delighted for Mrs Betancourt and all the others who were released, and for their families. The release means the end of a very harrowing time and is a reminder that we must never give up hope.I spoke to President Uribe last Thursday and congratulated his government and army and the Colombian people on this successful operation. Again I should like to emphasise that democracy must never give in to terrorism and that enforcing the law is a political and moral obligation.We must continue to make every possible effort to secure the release of all the hostages. Mrs Betancourt was abducted on 23 February 2002. Since that time, the European Parliament has taken part in repeated initiatives with a view to her release. In 2006, together with the Pa\u00eds Libre Foundation, she was one of the three finalists for the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament believes that Ingrid Betancourt's commitment has been and remains essential to lasting peace in Colombia. Now we have an ongoing obligation to keep before the public the dramatic situation of the hostages still being held in Colombia and to work towards their release.Last week, I invited Mrs Betancourt to visit the European Parliament - at a time to suit her and after she has recovered. I should like, at this point, to urge FARC and all other terrorist organisations to lay down their arms and abandon irrational and meaningless violence. We shall never submit to terrorism! I call for all hostages to be released and for those involved to accept the Colombian Government's offer of working together to find a peaceful settlement.(Applause)* * *Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the French Minister of State for European Affairs and representative of the new Presidency, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, most warmly to this House. This is the first time that the representative of a government has been present right at the start of our work. I hope that we can continue our work, which has commenced exceptionally well, equally successfully.(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON253 : Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through this public signing of the legal instrument on the Galileo programme we are emphasising the importance we attach to the European satellite navigation programmes EGNOS and Galileo. The regulation being signed today is a signal reminder that many aims can only be achieved in the framework of the European Union and not by individual Member States acting alone. EGNOS and Galileo can and will give the European Union the means to establish a European alternative and complement to other systems. At the same time, they will enable us to enhance the competitiveness of our industry in major strategic technological fields.Galileo is to comprise a network of 30 satellites and a ground-control infrastructure. The text of the regulation we shall be signing today is the result of negotiations between the European institutions which were brought to a successful conclusion at first reading.The institutions found solutions that made it possible to establish such a highly complex technical system, particularly by agreeing on Community funding of EUR 3.4 billion. As a result, Galileo can become operational from 2013 at the latest.As President of the European Parliament I would like to express my very special thanks to the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Angelika Niebler, and the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Etelka Barsi-Pataky, for their successful efforts, as well as to the Slovenian Presidency for its significant commitment to this very important strategic dossier.(Applause)I also hope that this public signing will underline that we intend to go on working with vigour and dedication to achieve tangible progress for our citizens. Thank you for being here today, and thank you for your attention.I now invite the representative of the Council, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, to address us.(Applause)\nPERSON254 : President-in-Office. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will now be possible to ascertain precise positioning and timing information with the satellite radio navigation system launched by the European Union and the European Space Agency. I should like to join you, Mr President, in paying tribute to the Slovenian Presidency, which has brought this difficult agreement to a successful conclusion. I should also like to pay tribute to Mrs Niebler, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, your rapporteur and those leading Members of the European Parliament who have made the adoption of this Regulation possible.This is a major step forward that we are taking today by adopting this Regulation on Galileo. It will enable the deployment of the publicly funded global satellite positioning system. As Mr P\u00f6ttering has said, this system is based on a constellation of 30 satellites and ground stations and will provide users in many sectors with information on their location. Therefore, for many of our citizens, this is an indication of real progress being made by Europe.It will not only ensure our independence by providing a signal that could replace the American GPS signal, for example when that service is down, but it also goes much further, because it will provide services that are not currently available through GPS: the tracking of people in distress, which is also essential to the role that Europe must play in relation to its citizens, or the establishment of a safety of life service that is particularly suited to air traffic management. Galileo will therefore bring tangible results to the daily lives of our citizens.The European Commission, Commissioner, and the European Space Agency have launched the selection process for companies that will be involved in the deployment of the various lots awarded to implement this system; the establishment of Galileo is obviously also of major importance for the competitiveness of European industry.Overall, the management of the Galileo programme will be placed under the political control of Parliament and the Council. You may rest assured that the French Presidency is determined to work very closely with the European Parliament; it proposes that the Galileo Interinstitutional Panel, the GIP, which involves the three EU institutions - the Commission, Parliament and the Council - meet as soon as possible in order to discuss the conditions necessary for the successful implementation of this programme, which is very important for the European Union as a whole.\nPERSON255 : Thank you very much, Minister. Mr Jouyet and I shall now sign the Galileo Regulation, and I would like to ask Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Angelika Niebler, chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Etelka Barsi-Pataky, the rapporteur, to step forward and join us.(Signing of the Galileo Regulation)(Applause)"

"transcript": "PERSON106 : (FR) Mr President, rather than invoking Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure on the admissibility of amendments, since it seems, in fact, that an amendment bears only a distant relationship to the original text of the report, I should like to suggest that this House refer the text back to committee.I shall explain that proposal very briefly. The main purpose of the Corbett report, even in the opinion of Mr Corbett himself, is to prevent Members who share a belief in the defence of national identity, sovereignty and independence being able to form a group.However, I should like to point out the pernicious effects of the report. In the next parliamentary term, it might result in a very large number of non-attached Members who, having discovered their common ground, decide to form a group that would certainly be politically incorrect but would actually have even more Members than you fear.I am therefore following the totally anti-democratic, partisan and sectarian logic of Mr Corbett and the originators of this plan and am drawing their attention to the pernicious effects of texts like this. I suggest that the possible consequences of such a provision should be considered in committee.\nPERSON107 : Mr Gollnisch, I was in the chair when your group was dissolved.\nPERSON108 : Mr President, the worst possible reason to change the Rules is to aim it at one particular person or one particular group of people. That is the difference between the rule of law and arbitrary rule. In any case, I think this report, in the state that it now stands, is illegal because it was voted against in its original form in committee. The amended version now before the House bears such little resemblance to the original one, which was defeated in committee, so I think that, if we duly follow our own procedures, we have no option but to refer it either back to committee or to the legal services for arbitration.\nPERSON109 : chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, there is no reason to refer this report back to committee. If Mr Gollnisch had wished to present his case, he could have attended our committee meeting, but he did not.We have discussed all of this, and I put it to the House that that the number of Members of this Parliament has grown from 626 to the present level of 785 following the major enlargement, and is now set to rise from 732 to 751, and that, when such changes are made, the minimum size of a political group naturally needs to be redefined too. We have always done this in the past, and we are doing it again now. As you will know, the amendments on the table are compromise motions.For this reason, Mr President, I believe we should vote today rather than referring the matter back to committee again. Referral would serve no useful purpose.(The request for referral back to committee was rejected.)- Before the vote on Amendment 3:\nPERSON111 : on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to briefly state the reasons for my oral amendment, and it actually concerns both Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen, who gave the size of Parliament as an argument for this change. The present oral amendment, which I am tabling on behalf of my group, is a natural extension of the amendments that were adopted in 2002 when Mr Corbett was rapporteur. I am therefore closely following his reasoning, which took account of the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 countries. Using the same ratios for an EU now consisting of 27 countries, one arrives at a figure of 3%, which must represent one fifth of these nations, resulting in a lower limit of 22 for the number of members. I hope that my amendment is seen for what it is, namely a compromise text. Yesterday's negotiations made a plea for us to seek a compromise, one whose text was fully consistent with the reasoning used by Mr Corbett in 2002. The oral amendment reads as follows. I shall read it out in English, as I have only the English version, which was circulated among Members today.'A political group shall comprise Members elected in at least one fifth of the Member States. The minimum number of Members required to form a political group shall be 3% of the total number of Members.'(DA) I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of this oral amendment, as it would be a compromise in which we who are opposed to the original proposal indeed remain faithful to Mr Corbett's logic.(The oral amendment was not accepted.)"

This has been a difficult directive, and there have been very lengthy discussions, but in my view we have ultimately reached a successful conclusion.I should like in particular to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Reul, Mr Swoboda, Mr Manders, Mr Turmes, Mr Sepp\u00e4nen, and obviously Commissioner Piebalgs - I hope I have not left anyone out - as well as Mr Vidal-Quadras for his cooperation. I should also like to thank the secretariat as a whole, my staff and my fellow workers.Only three seconds. This is a directive which is of interest and is extremely important. It is a directive - please may I speak for three seconds. It is a directive - we lose so much time in this House! - which is of interest to operators, often, unfortunately, in the form of monopolies, and to consumers.I believe that in our work, we have tried not to penalise producers or consumers but have tried - and thank you for the applause, but I shall press on - we have tried to work for all European citizens in the sense ...

"transcript": "PERSON090 : rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a very few remarks on this report, one aspect of which, as you know, is that it contributes to the process of deregulation and the reduction of red tape.The report provides for an obligation on the Commission to report annually to Parliament, informing us how this process of cutting red tape and deregulating is proceeding and, we hope, how well it is succeeding. We in Parliament, however, can play a far more prominent role in this process. It is therefore my hope and wish that, in addition to this reporting obligation on the part of the Commission, we ourselves can be far more actively involved in this process, for example through our work in committee. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular can take the lead in these matters, which includes engagement in dialogue with Commissioner Verheugen and the Stoiber group.Accordingly, we in Parliament still have work to do on this dossier, and I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that point."

"transcript": "PERSON156 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the oral amendment I want to propose is the following: 'The spouses may agree to designate the law applicable to divorce and legal separation provided that such law is in conformity with the fundamental rights defined in the Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of public policy.'This oral amendment limits the right of the spouses to have the choice of law as provided for in Article 20. I believe that it satisfies the policy of the PPE-DE Group, which wanted to limit the choice of law so as to be in conformity, as we say here, with fundamental rights and also with public policy. So a judge, faced with this application by spouses to apply foreign law, will judge and say that they do not accept that because it is against public policy or fundamental rights.\nPERSON157 : Madam President, I can accept this amendment because it is self-evident. Of course, the applicable law must conform with the principles of our treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I have no problem with this amendment.\nPERSON158 : Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?I do not see any.(The oral amendment was accepted)\nPERSON159 : (IT) Madam President, obviously I do not disagree that human rights and the fundamental rights of the Union must be respected in the choice of law. That is not the issue. The issue is that if the spouses can choose the law - I would point out that the choice of law is an exception in all legal systems - whether this law must be the law of one of the 27 States of the Union or that of any country in the world.I do not therefore oppose this amendment, but I feel that it cannot preclude the vote on the subsequent amendments of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which establish that only the law of one of the 27 countries of the Union may be chosen.\nPERSON160 : (FR) Madam President, it is obvious from this debate that there is still some way to go where this matter is concerned. These issues obviously ought to have been debated in committee. That is why, in compliance with our Rules of Procedure, I am pleased to ask you to refer this report back to the committee.(The request for referral to committee was rejected)After the vote on Amendment 32\nPERSON162 : Madam President, the agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe was as follows: if we accept this oral amendment from the PPE-DE, all the other PPE-DE amendments will be withdrawn. I expect the PPE-DE to withdraw these amendments.\nPERSON163 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, it is true that the agreement included this term. Mr Casini was of a different opinion. I believe that the PPE-DE amendments are covered by the oral amendment which I made and which was approved and there is no need to vote on these amendments, which were tabled precisely in order to support the call for the right to be restricted.\nPERSON164 : Amendments 32 to 37 inclusive have therefore lapsed.We shall continue, therefore.

"transcript": "PERSON006 : Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union. On 1 May 2004, seventy-five million people from ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Mediterranean - namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus - expressed their pleasure at becoming citizens of the European Union. This enlargement was followed in 2007 by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.The fact that this was possible was one of the most amazing developments of our time. After the people of Central and Eastern Europe had suffered sixty years of oppression, the enlargement of the EU represented the completion of the reunification of our continent, based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and human dignity. As a result of this process, the EU has gained in strength, diversity and cultural richness. The enlargement process was, and is, an enriching experience for every single Member State, as well as for the EU as a whole.Five years after that historical moment, enlargement has proved to be a great success for the EU. Its significance for the everyday lives of our citizens has continued to increase. After the servitude of Communism, the enlargement process contributed to making democracy a reality and to strengthening stability on our continent. Enlargement improved the standard of living in the new Member States and provided a powerful stimulus for the whole European economy, as the old Member States also benefited from the new export and investment opportunities, as well as a larger market. In essence, the accession of twelve new countries has strengthened the position of the EU worldwide, and has lent it more weight as an international political and economic actor.During the five years that have passed since enlargement, we in the European Parliament, and the other institutions of the European Union, have succeeded in integrating our new members. We have learnt to meet each other half way and to work together more closely. However, a larger and more diverse EU requires closer cooperation and the a greater capacity to take action.The Treaty of Lisbon contains the core reforms necessary to adapt the EU's institutions to the consequences of enlargement and to place them in a position to meet the challenges we face. Even if the discussion about the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon has yet to be completed, we should be confident that we will have a positive result at the beginning of next year and we are hoping for a positive result in the Czech Senate next Wednesday.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, we should be extremely pleased that we are part of this community today and, as it is so beautifully put in the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007: 'we have united for the better'. We have cause to be pleased and thankful.Now we must turn to a rather worrying fact: I wish to express our profound concern regarding the tragic situation facing the US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, who has been sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the US, and is currently being held in the Evin prison in Tehran. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to join the President of the European Council, and the President of the US, in demanding Roxana Saberi's immediate and unconditional release.(Applause)The case of Roxana Saberi reflects the dramatic overall situation in Iran in terms of human rights, which, since 2005 - especially in relation to civil and political rights - has continued to deteriorate, in spite of the fact that, within the framework of existing international instruments, Iran has made a commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. The sentencing of Mrs Saberi comes at a critical moment: two months before the presidential elections in Iran, and only a short time after efforts were initiated by the US and the EU to improve relations with Iran.I am deeply concerned that, in the light of the political developments underway, Mrs Saberi could be used as a bargaining chip, and I would like to condemn in the strongest possible terms a move that is so clearly politically motivated. I would like to assure Mrs Saberi's family of our solidarity and the strong commitment of the European Parliament to ensuring unconditional respect for human rights and democracy in Iran and throughout the world.(Applause)I would like to add that we have been informed that a young woman in Iran, who was accused of having committed a crime when she was a minor, has now been executed. This is contrary to all the rules of international law and we raise our voices against this crime.(Applause)Finally, I would like to inform you that after the tragic events which took place in Appeldoorn, in the Netherlands, last week, I have conveyed, on behalf of all of us, our deepest condolences to the Dutch Queen, the families of the victims and the Dutch people, and that, across Europe, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Dutch friends.These were some items of news. We will now return to our usual business."

We fully agree with the basic thrust of Mr Meijer's report; he has done a very good job. There is one sensitive issue and that is the question of the name. We want to make it easier for Macedonia to navigate through these rocky waters, which is why, between now and the next Strasbourg part-session, we want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next Strasbourg part-session. That means postponing the vote today.\nPERSON093 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr Swoboda, this is laughable! Everyone knows that we cannot find a solution within a week. This row has been going on for years, and the decision has to be taken: Macedonia is called Macedonia is called Macedonia. Greece has to accept that and then we will take a vote.

It is possible to achieve compromises within a matter of days, if you take time to seek these compromises, and that is precisely the purpose of Mr Swoboda's proposal. Yes, we can vote in the next part-session, but in the intervening period, we could find some kind of compromise for our resolution, given that we seem to be well on the way to doing so here in the House. We should take the time to do that, even if Mr Cohn-Bendit feels under pressure.\nPERSON095 : rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, although I do not fundamentally disagree with Mr Cohn-Bendit regarding the name, I think that Mr Swoboda's proposal should be adopted. I think it would be wise for Parliament to look into this further and to find a solution, and the negotiations, the contacts between Macedonia and Greece, are important in the coming days. I think therefore that it is indeed wise to postpone this vote until Strasbourg.(Parliament adopted the motion. The vote was postponed)"

It stops here.

The issues of energy solidarity, a solidarity in a wider political context, as well as protection for the environment are all extremely important for the European Parliament.

Furthermore, the Commission is legally bound by the Treaties and the Framework Agreement and therefore reserves its right to agree the relevant procedures to be applied in each of the different scenarios on a case-by-case basis and in a constructive spirit of cooperation, as has so far been the case. This approach has proved successful for both institutions."

"transcript": "PERSON124 : The next item is the report by B\u00e1rbara D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/.../JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (11563/2007 - C6-0409/2007 -.\nPERSON125 : rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the report which we have produced for debate and approval today embodies a 2005 initiative, in which the seven Member States decided to step up cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.The German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis by means of a framework decision, that is to say under the third pillar, on the lines of what was done with the Schengen Agreement, leaving aside, however, the matter of illegal immigration which, according to the Tampere mandate, should come under the third pillar.It is therefore regrettable that clear Community powers were not included in the international treaty, since this not only creates judicial confusion, but leaves us with two legal frameworks of reference.The first was negotiated in a less than transparent manner. National parliaments were not consulted, nor was the European Parliament. We were only consulted at the last minute, in haste and in a non-binding manner as the instrument was about to be incorporated into the Community acquis.The report of our unfortunate fellow Member Fausto Correia sets out the position of the European Parliament on this matter.Today we are pleased to be able to say that the Council consultation is being presented on the basis of the codecision procedure. This is a consultation which does not confine itself to the agreement itself but includes its preamble and annex, which we appreciate, because, although they are technical, they contain provisions which are of great political significance. Many of them are designed specifically to ensure the protection of personal and sensitive data.However, we are sorry that the Council has still not approved the framework decision on the definition of data protection in order to lay down certain minimum rules. It is incongruous for the Council to prepare to adopt this decision rather than its own general law. Nor was the European Data Protection Supervisor consulted at any time.Briefly, the report provides for cooperation in terms of exchanging data on DNA, fingerprints, vehicle registration numbers and personal and non-personal data. The aim is to be able to compare the DNA profile of a person with the future databases of 27 national contact points.The report clearly indicates that common guarantees must be laid down for the protection of data and the right of defence of suspects and guilty parties. Only the non-coding parts of DNA, in other words the zones containing no genetic expression, may be transferred.All shared information must indicate the stage of the proceedings affecting the person concerned and the database from which the information was obtained.The European Parliament must be consulted again if the Council wishes to alter the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany in any way and particularly regarding the number of loci needed to make accurate comparisons.I would also remind the Council that the Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the Member States called for the possibility of incorporating this framework decision in the new Lisbon Treaty system, in order to allow recourse to the Court of Justice.I would also like to point out that, in the paragraph relating to officers and the possibility of cross-border cooperation, I do not agree with the part approved in committee, which gives officers powers to detain and to take statements in a Member State other than their own.Finally, ladies and gentlemen, bilateral cross-border cooperation has always existed but this decision will be a first in terms of Europe-wide cooperation. It is true that there is concern, serious concern, that, despite good intentions, the proliferation of networks may lead to abuse and possibly to serious mistakes.Protecting the innocent is without doubt the foremost concern of everyone and of our House in particular, given that it represents all our citizens.\nPERSON126 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the political agreement reached in the Council on 13 June 2007 on the first part of the legislative package aimed at transposing the Pr\u00fcm Treaty into European law, Germany has submitted the initiative that we are about to discuss, namely the implementation of the decision which is the subject matter of the first part and its annex.Mrs D\u00fchrkop, the Commission has consistently supported the integration of the Pr\u00fcm Treaty into the European Union. This is an instrument of major importance that will significantly strengthen police cooperation between the Member States by enabling them to take more effective action to combat terrorism and cross-border crime, for example by facilitating the exchange of the DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data of wanted persons.The removal of checks on persons at the internal borders of the EU, between the signatory countries of the Schengen Agreement, is a major step forward in the process of European integration. However, it is our duty to ensure that this area of free movement is also, of course, an area of security and justice.Improving police cooperation between the Member States' authorities, while fully respecting fundamental rights and, in particular, data protection, is essential for guaranteeing greater security within the European Union for the benefit of our citizens.The draft decision that we are discussing today constitutes follow-up action required to ensure the full technical and operational implementation of the decision on which the Council reached political agreement in June 2007. This agreement aims to transpose the essential provisions of the Treaty of Pr\u00fcm into the legal framework of the European Union.The Commission has also consistently supported the need to involve Parliament in the procedure for amending the annex to this instrument. In the Commission's view, the provisions on data protection laid down in the decision of June 2007, as well as in the draft currently being debated, will be supplemented by the provisions of the Framework Decision on data protection in the third pillar. They clearly need to be supplemented, as you have said.For its part, the Commission generally welcomes the amendments that you propose, Mrs D\u00fchrkop. However, as this is an initiative put forward by the Member States, Mr President, the Commission will submit its detailed position on the amendments during discussions in the Council.This is my response, and I would like to conclude by thanking your rapporteur once again for having been kind enough to highlight the means and conditions for the proper implementation of this decision.\nPERSON127 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are few issues on which the citizens of Europe broadly agree that Europe is making serious efforts on their behalf. What we are debating here today is a significant issue of that kind: cooperation among Member States in order successfully to combat cross-border crime and terrorism. I am very glad we managed to reach a consensus in committee too, thanks to the preparatory work and the very fair cooperation with the rapporteur. That means that while we may not agree on every single point, we are broadly in agreement and want to play our part in making headway in this matter.The Pr\u00fcm Agreement process was very laborious and took a long time. We only advanced bit by bit. Yet it is a good thing that we now have European agreements on the exchange of data, that national databases are being linked up and that we can use those national databases to pursue and prevent crime.I would have liked to see more progress in certain areas of this whole project. That is why I am taking this opportunity not just to talk about what we have achieved to date but also to say this: of course this decision also includes a few points that may apply tomorrow and the day after. For instance, we want to use joint police forces more efficiently and quickly and we want police forces from one Member State that have specific skills to be able to operate in another Member State. Mrs D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop has just pointed out that there are certain difficulties. Yet it is important to drive this process forward, to ensure that we have more European responsibilities here and carry out more joint actions. In the end we may find that a very good way to promote the European idea is by demonstrating to people that we are trying to resolve important issues in a manner they too consider positive.\nPERSON128 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I believe I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we had excellent cooperation with the rapporteur. We cooperated very closely, as Mr Reul has just said. Nonetheless, we have to ask why it is so urgent to take a decision, why it has to be taken now and, in particular, before the end of the year. We would have been very happy to see the Lisbon Treaty rules apply here, such as judicial review, as also proper participation in the sense of codecision with the European Parliament.As regards the data protection aspect that was addressed here, Pr\u00fcm has its own data protection rules, and then there are the implementing rules and the treaty rules. Indeed Mrs D\u00fchrkop D\u00fchrkop also noted the need for a framework decision in the third pillar. If we take a careful look at the categories of data regulated by the Pr\u00fcm Treaty, we see that it is more than necessary to have framework legislation on the matter. We must also ask why so-called special categories of data are included, such as data providing information on sexual orientation, health, political and union activities, and religious belief. That goes far beyond the basic data needed in relation to organised crime. There are restrictions on the use of that data yet it remains incredible that it can be used at all.In the case of DNA data, we strongly support the rapporteur's view that - if that data is necessary and if it can be exchanged - it must be clearly restricted and used only for the purpose for which it was intended. Furthermore, it must be made clear that Member States which do not have national DNA databases are not obliged to establish them.I want to finish by saying that it would be very sensible - as personal exchanges of views with police authorities have brought to light - if, instead of concentrating on legislative measures, we financed programmes to assist the exchange of personnel between police forces. That would be sure to improve cooperation in the Union.It is astonishing that the funding has not yet been clarified given that the decision is to be taken very soon. Before spending money, people should know how much is to be spent, before taking a decision people should know how much it costs.\nPERSON129 : Mr President, the German Government's initiative and the report we are debating are not innocently technical, as they are being made out to be. They are about the technical and administrative conditions necessary for the swift and successful application of preventive data recording enacted by the Treaty of Pr\u00fcm, which was incorporated into EU legislation a few months ago. DNA data, fingerprints, personal data and information of all kinds is gathered, processed and exchanged automatically in every possible detail, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, between the repressive mechanisms of the Member States and the EU. Every citizen and worker in the EU may be under preventive surveillance and recorded as data. The security forces act on the slightest suspicion that someone might at some point in the future commit offences or endanger public order and security. In other words, everyone is guilty until proven innocent.The report we are discussing takes things a step further in data recording legalisation, opening the door to the recording and exchange of data relating to political views, religious or philosophical convictions and party political or trade union membership. Why do you need all of this? To tackle organised crime? That is a lie! You want to record data on everyone in the world! You want to ban and intimidate anyone who questions your policies! For this reason, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, are voting against the report.\nPERSON130 : (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, since the 9/11 attacks if not before, the EU has concentrated its technical security measures almost entirely on combating terrorism. Now, it is certainly right actually for us not to make it easy for potential assassins to download bomb-making instructions from the Internet and of course closer cooperation among Member States is to be welcomed. Yet, in the fight against terrorism we cannot allow innocent citizens to become targets or awkward critics to be silenced.I believe there is a dangerous trend worldwide constantly to erode the basic liberties for which our forefathers fought so hard. We are running the risk of becoming a profoundly illiberal society, by passing on passenger data, by Internet surveillance. I hope we do not soon find that every nonconformist who attends a demonstration supports a referendum, or even dares to criticise the EU is branded a potential terrorist.Of course it is important to be vigilant - but not to the detriment of civil liberties. And of course we must not allow other areas, such as combating organised crime, to suffer as a result. We must not underestimate the dangers of ever-expanding parallel societies, migration-based violence and potential ethnic and cultural conflicts.\nPERSON131 : Mr President, when talking about incitement to terrorism in the age of the internet and the age of new technologies we are talking about completely new challenges and completely new threats and, as my colleague has said, we must strike a very fine balance between infringing the civil liberties of various political organisations and combating threats to our security and the security of our citizens.In recent weeks, speakers from the Council of Europe, for example, have raised various concerns and asked us to adopt in full various recommendations presented by the Council of Europe. We must be selective as to what aspects of the Council of Europe's very valuable work we transfer to the European Parliament, because Parliament has its own, unique role to play in this matter.In dealing with the new threats posed by terrorism, the most difficult problem we face will be to actually define what incitement is, and whether justified criticism of governments could ever be considered to be incitement to terrorism. That was one of the arguments presented recently, at a meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, by Mr Dick Marty from the Council of Europe. He seemed to have little faith in our democratic structures, suggesting that various articles could be misused by governments. I have more faith than him in our democratic procedures, and believe we will be able to handle this issue sensitively, but also with the prudence it demands of this institution.\nPERSON132 : Mr President, there are 4.3 million individuals whose DNA is on the UK national DNA database and available to police. That is 7% of the UK population - at least five times higher, as a proportion, than in any other country. That figure includes 150 000 children under the age of 16, of whom 25 000 have never been charged with an offence. Britain's most senior police forensics expert has even suggested that children as young as five should go on the DNA database if they exhibit behaviour indicating they might be potential criminals in later life. This is taking predictive policing to a ridiculous level.My party believes this to be the realisation of Orwell's 'Big Brother' Britain. The DNA of innocent people should not be exchanged, and at the very minimum, in line with the advice of the European Data Protection Supervisor, there should be precise limitations on what data can be exchanged and a health warning in that exchange if the person has no criminal record.\nPERSON133 : (PT) Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a second decision to establish rules necessary for the implementation of another initiative that already has the political agreement of the Council, but has not yet even been adopted.I am aware that there has been a series of initiatives to combat terrorism and cross-border crime in order to strengthen security and vigilance, but I regret that the same attention has not been paid to increasing the protection of fundamental rights. The European Union still has no standard set of procedural safeguards and no adequate third pillar legal instrument on data protection, as Vice-President Barrot has just recognised in his speech.I ask you, Commissioner, to help us explain to the Council that this situation is unacceptable, especially if we take into account that most of the measures to combat terrorism and promote police cooperation have involved the collection and exchange of personal data. This latest initiative is yet another example and it is all the more serious as it involves the collection, storage and sharing of DNA data and fingerprints, etc. The data protection standards set out in Chapter VI of the Pr\u00fcm initiative, which ensure more specific guarantees, are not self-sufficient and, in order to function correctly, they need a complete and general framework, which can only be effectively guaranteed through the framework decision on third pillar data protection.It was with great satisfaction that we approved this initiative, in which essential aspects of cooperation in the Pr\u00fcm initiative will be transposed into the Union framework. However, we cannot leave the job half done. It is also essential to ensure the existence of a clear and effective judicial framework for data protection.\nPERSON134 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, in my opinion, Mr Coelho has just provided a very clear and objective picture of the situation.The proposal initially put forward by the Commission was certainly more ambitious, and we regret, in particular, the decision's more limited scope. However, the purpose of the decision is to lay the foundations required to ensure a minimum level of protection in the third pillar. Without the adoption of such a decision, we would have no general rule applicable in the third pillar, which would be even worse. We hope that this decision will be adopted as soon as possible, once Parliament has delivered its opinion on the new text that the Council has submitted to Parliament for the second time.As I said earlier, when thanking the rapporteur, Mrs D\u00fchrkop, once again, clearly, in the Commission's view, the provisions on data protection will be supplemented by the provisions of the Framework Decision on data protection in the third pillar.With these closing remarks, Mr President, I should like to thank all of the speakers for their contributions to this debate.\nPERSON136 : rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank all those fellow Members with whom it has been a pleasure to work on this report. I will not answer you individually, but in general.All of us are particularly concerned about the need to strike a balance between combating terrorism and crime and, at the same time, rigorously protecting private and public rights because no one may be stripped of his civil rights for the sake of the fight against terrorism.Such a balance is sometimes difficult to achieve, but it is up to us democrats to be constantly on the lookout for any abuse in this area.Secondly, reference has been made to police cooperation: this is vital. I live in a region where terrorism exists. I have police protection myself, and when I have to go to France, I have to ask my local police to send a form to Madrid, who will then ask France for permission to cross the border with a gun, and that takes a week. I realise that we ought to have a swifter, less bureaucratic method, so perhaps there could be a European police permit. I think, I believe that European police forces have more or less the same training.Furthermore, Mr Alvaro, as Sarah Ludford and Mr Coelho also mentioned, we urgently need the Framework Decision, and this is a matter which we want to put to the Council. We need minimum standards of data protection. This is a fair demand on the part of all citizens.\nPERSON137 : The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008.\nPERSON997 : in writing. - Today we are fortunate that law enforcement agencies have tools at their disposal such as DNA data, automated fingerprint identification and vehicle registration data. I am all in favour of having a common database of all the necessary tools to fight terrorism and cross-border crime. It is a fact that data protection is essential but in the fight against terrorism and international crime it is secondary.Not only am I in favour of sharing databases but I am also in favour of having compulsory national databases. The majority of European citizens and residents are law abiding and should not fear having their data, be it DNA and fingerprinting, available on a common European database.Malta is a neutral state but where terror is concerned we are not neutral. The targeting of innocent civilians can never be justified. Terror is one of the most hideous crimes at par with genocide and war crimes.At present the norm is that terrorists are tried in national courts. The time has come to consider an international judicial structure specifically for trying terrorists.\nPERSON996 : in writing. - (FI) There needs to be greater cooperation between the border control authorities, customs, the police and the security authorities to improve the safety of Europeans.The purpose of the Pr\u00fcm Convention is to deepen cooperation between EU countries to counter terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal immigration.The Pr\u00fcm Convention will strengthen security within Europe. A smooth flow of the exchange of information between the security authorities, especially border control authorities, will be a key priority.There must be weighty reasons for information exchange between the EU countries. Clearly, breaking the law is a good reason for this as is sufficient evidence of intended wrongdoing.Information exchange needs to respect the protection of law-abiding European individuals so that abuses of human rights do not take place as a result of breaches of privacy.The purpose of cooperation in matters of security is to keep Europe a safe place to live in and to protect law-abiding citizens.Cooperation in matters of security must protect Europeans against criminals in order to make our everyday lives as safe as possible and to enable our children to live without fear."

"transcript": "PERSON139 : The next item is the Commission statement on the cost of obtaining a visa for Belarusian and Ukrainian citizens\nPERSON140 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the questions that you have asked me on the European visa rules applicable to Ukraine and Belarus.Firstly, in the case of Ukraine, the Agreement on readmission and the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas, both of which entered into force at the beginning of 2008, represent an important milestone in relations between the European Union and Ukraine. On the one hand, they will promote people-to-people contacts, which in turn will help improve mutual understanding and strengthen relations in all areas, and, on the other, they will commit both sides, the European Union and Ukraine, to close cooperation to combat illegal immigration.The first priority is to ensure the speedy, operational and harmonised implementation of the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas to Ukrainian citizens. To ensure that this Agreement is properly and uniformly applied, draft guidelines have been drawn up and approved by the Member States and the Ukrainian authorities. These guidelines should be finalised and adopted in the near future by the Joint Committee established by the Agreement.As stated in the preamble to the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, the introduction of a visa-free travel regime for the citizens of Ukraine is recognised only as a long-term prospect. The process that will lead to the introduction of such a regime depends mainly on the satisfactory implementation of the Agreement on readmission and of the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas.I should like to emphasise that the enlargement of the Schengen area in no way affects the arrangements for carrying out checks at the borders between Ukraine and those Member States which became part of the Schengen area on 21 December 2007. Those Member States have been applying the Schengen rules on external border checks since their accession, and since September 2007 they also carry out checks on persons in the Schengen Information System - SIS.However, to make travel easier for Ukrainian citizens living in the border area, agreements on local border traffic have been signed between Hungary and Ukraine, and between Ukraine and Poland. Moreover, the Commission has called for amendments to the agreement between Ukraine and Hungary with regard to the demarcation of the border area in order to bring this agreement into line with Community rules; this is also the case for the agreement between Ukraine and Poland. That is all I have to say about travel for Ukrainian citizens living in the border area.The situation for visas, on the other hand, is different. Prior to 21 December 2007 those Member States that did not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis were not bound by the Schengen provisions on visa fees. These Member States could therefore waive this fee for all Ukrainian citizens. However, this is now no longer possible. Nevertheless, the standard visa fee of EUR 60 does not apply to Ukrainian visa applicants. As confirmed by the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine that entered into force on 1 January 2008, the fee for processing visa applications of Ukrainian citizens will remain at EUR 35. In addition, the Agreement exempts broad categories of Ukrainian visa applicants from the visa fee, which means that more than 50%, I repeat, more than 50% of Ukrainian nationals now wishing to travel to Schengen countries benefit from a full waiving of the visa fee.I should now like to turn to Belarus. In its Communication on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy, dated 4 December 2006, the Commission emphasised the importance of facilitating the issuance of visas for relations with the countries covered by the Neighbourhood Policy. The Commission restated the European Union's willingness to develop Action Plans with neighbouring countries and to enter into negotiations with them in order to facilitate the issuance of visas and the granting of permission for readmission.Belarus is one of the countries covered by the Neighbourhood Policy, but it has to be said that no Action Plan has been developed with this country yet owing to its overall political situation. This is why there are no plans to open discussions on the possible facilitation of the issuance of visas and on readmission with Belarus at this stage.Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise that the existing acquis on the issuance of short-term visas provides for exemption from visa fees for some categories of persons, such as children under the age of six, students and researchers. In addition, under the current rules, the Member States may, at any time, cancel or reduce the visa fee in justifiable individual cases, for example for humanitarian reasons, to protect cultural interests or on foreign policy grounds.Furthermore, the neighbouring Member States - Poland, Latvia and Lithuania in particular - always have the possibility of negotiating local border traffic agreements with Belarus. This would be a means of facilitating border crossing and the movement of border residents between Belarus and its neighbouring countries, whilst promoting contacts between local communities. Border residents holding a special local border traffic permit would be exempt from the visa requirement. Poland and Belarus have already entered into negotiations to that end.This concludes what I wanted to say, whilst emphasising the pertinence of the questions that you have asked and bringing you up to date with the most recent developments in this matter.\nPERSON141 : on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for coming and presenting the latest position of the Commission on visa issues for the Ukraine and Belarus. A month ago, a delegation which comprised members of most of the mainstream opposition in Belarus visited Strasbourg at the invitation of the PPE-DE Group to discuss how the political situation is developing in that country, but also during that visit colleagues may have seen their appeals to this Parliament to support their efforts to reduce the visa fees they are currently paying, which are indeed prohibitive for the majority of Belarus citizens.If we really want to encourage Belarus to pick a pro-European route in future - which we sincerely hope will be the case - the strongest arguments we have are those which the Belarus citizens can see with their own eyes. It is very difficult for them, in the regime in which they live, to have a real insight into what freedom and democracy, human rights and rule of law really mean. It is difficult to promote a civil society. It is difficult to show them that Europe is open and friendly and supports their move towards a full democracy. The best way we can do that is to allow those citizens access into Europe not at rates which will frighten or prohibit entry by most citizens.Commissioner, you very rightly said that specific groups are excluded, and that is indeed children, and people with family contacts; it is people who are visiting the European Union for cultural or scientific or educational reasons, and I would encourage individual member countries to make use of that legal provision to let those people actually make use of those facilities. But it is very sad that Serbia and Russia are treated on better terms than Belarus's citizens.\nPERSON142 : on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first I want to thank the Commissioner for the very precise information, as ever, he has provided on this issue.I myself have experienced the problems of visas and visa restrictions in the Balkans and I still come across them today, although things have eased up a little. Let us take Serbia for instance, since it has already been mentioned. In spite of the present simplifications, in the context of Yugoslavia - i.e. a communist regime - it had far more contact with the West, with the European countries, in the past than it has now, which means there is something wrong with the whole system. We really do need fundamental changes.The Commissioner rightly pointed out that in Ukraine more than half of all applicants enjoy exemptions of one kind or another. I wonder what kind of system exempts 50% or more. I admit, however, that this is not his fault.Let me now turn to Belarus. I was happy to support the proposal from Mrs Grabowska and Mr Paleckis because I find it very difficult to accept that the citizens of that country should suffer twice over because of a bad regime: not just under the regime but also because we are not formulating any plan of action in face of that bad regime.Sometimes we have to choose to act more unilaterally and decide on our own initiative to do something specifically to help those who receive no help from their own regime or government. The Commissioner indicated that to some extent that is already the case. Yet more needs to be done and we need to conduct a more aggressive policy toward Belarus. For instance, I would be interested to know - and perhaps the Commissioner can answer me at a later date - which countries grant which exemptions. Which European Union countries are particularly helpful and which are perhaps less so? Surely it is important to adopt a European Union stance and if some countries take a liberal approach it would be a disaster for others to be very restrictive.I would ask the Commission and the Council - given that we know that they bear the main responsibility - to work together with us to ensure that we can offer the citizens and all concerned in Belarus more advantages than we have done - laboriously - in the past.\nPERSON143 : on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) Mr President, Ukraine and Belarus have a key role to play in the Eastern dimension of our Neighbourhood policy.With Ukraine the aim is democracy, a market economy, consolidation of the orientation towards Europe while with Belarus the aim is the democratisation of the country. Relaxation of travel requirements is a flexible and valuable tool for this. Since 1 January citizens of Ukraine have benefited from a simplified visa regime, though the majority of them feel that the position today is harder than it was before, since getting into their major target countries, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, is now more difficult than it was previously. This is seen as a backward step, since the EUR 35 visa fee is a large sum of money for them, and the administrative burden and procedures are extremely complicated. So we have to show that for Ukraine the immediate aim, the granting of visa-free travel, will happen very soon, and until we can do this, the granting of visas without a fee will have an impact on an even greater number of people, as well the relaxation of the administrative burden.As for Belarus, we have to make it clear that Europe does not have a problem with the people of Belarus but with its oppressive regime. We would wish its citizens to be able to travel more easily and so we have to relax the EUR 60 visa fee, a huge amount of money, as in Belarus it is equivalent to half the average monthly wage, and we also have to reduce the administrative burden, as the complicated regulations are difficult to comply with. In this way we can reach a position where the citizens of Ukraine and Belarus feel that they are close to Europe. Thank you.\nPERSON144 : on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union will not guarantee the security of its Eastern border by ignoring the interests of Belarusians and Ukrainians. We should support visits to the Union by the widest possible groups of people specifically from Ukraine and Belarus, and at the same time isolating the Lukashenka regime. Democratic processes and the changes in the mentality of our Eastern neighbours, for example as far as their perceptions of NATO in Ukraine are concerned, will take place more quickly thanks to personal experiences of visits in the European Union countries.At the moment Belarusians must pay EUR 60 for a visa. This is equivalent of one third of average salary and precludes most of the society from visiting. This situation suits the Lukashenka regime, since the more contacts with Western Europe are restricted, the easier it will be to control Belarusian society. The visa requirement isolates the Belarusian youth and those people who have opposition sympathies. The West should want to maintain contacts with these social groups. Expensive visa charges lead only to an increase in the activity of the visa mafia and to other pathologies on the borders. Such barriers also cause tangible losses to tourism in Poland. Skiers from Ukraine and Belarus have visited Polish mountains in large numbers in recent years. They have tended to arrive in early January, when the Orthodox Christmas begins. By now Polish skiing resorts are empty.Ladies and gentlemen, especially now, when at the NATO summit in Bucharest Vladimir Putin threatened to cause the break-up of Ukraine and stated that, and I quote, 'Ukraine is not even a state, and one part of its territory is Eastern Europe and another - a large one - was gifted to it by Russia', a clear signal is needed that the European Union will not tolerate such threats against its nearest neighbour in international politics.I appeal for the fastest possible commencement of a dialogue on specific actions so that the Ukrainians will not require EU visas. I wish to state clearly that a real vision of a contemporary and safe Europe is not possible without Ukraine.\nPERSON145 : on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, official EU policy towards Belarus is known as a policy of 'differentiation': on the one hand it is critical of the dictator Lukashenko while, on the other, it seeks to encourage and facilitate dialogue with the people. But charging EUR 60 - a third of a month's salary in Belarus - for a visa flies in the face of that policy. As a result, ordinary people in Belarus regard EU policy towards them as a policy of empty words!This issue has completely obscured our Schengen policy and is actually undermining the credibility of EU foreign policy. We cannot allow such a situation to continue. The democracy that we want to see developing in Belarus can come into being only if we make it easier for people from Belarus to see for themselves how democracy works in our countries. Any other approach would simply play into Lukashenko's hands. So we need to make a change and the Council told us, in its answer, that the reason why no change has yet been made is that the Commission has not tabled the necessary proposal.So, please, get to work! Put a proposal before the Council that will make it easier - in the interests of promoting democracy in Belarus - for people there to obtain visas.\nPERSON146 : (LT) Madam President, whatever has been said about the cost of visas for Belarusians and Ukrainians, there is no doubt that urgent decisions should be taken on this issue and that they should be taken by the European Union.On the subject of visas, the European Union has signed a visa facilitation agreement with Ukraine, as well as with Russia, Moldova and the Western Balkan states. However, negotiations on the agreement with Belarus have not even begun, because Alexander Lukashenko is not interested in offering Belarusian citizens the possibility of seeing the standard of life in the free world, especially if they find it to be much higher than that in Belarus.The issue of the cost of visas remains important not only for Belarus, but for Ukraine too. The fact that Ukrainian citizens have to pay EUR 35 for a Schengen visa does not solve the problem, because only certain small groups of Ukrainian citizens qualify for the visa facilitation regime. The case of Belarus is even more eloquent - Belarusians have to pay more for a Schengen visa - that is, they have to pay the price for Lukashenko's dictate.Is the visa regime adequate in view of the situation on the EU's Eastern border? I do not think so. According to statistics, Poland alone issues about 600 000 visas to Ukrainian citizens each year; as a comparison, the number of visas issued by all the Schengen countries in the same period is only 300 000. Prior to joining the Schengen area, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland maintained very low visa prices for Belarusian citizens: Lithuania and Poland charged only EUR 5 and Latvia issued visas free of charge. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia used to issue 400 000 visas to Belarusians, i.e. three times more than the number issued by the old Schengen countries.Would you say it is a good thing that only 26% of Belarusian citizens have ever visited an EU country, and that 60% of Belarusians have never seen a foreign person during the last three years? Of course not. We, the European Union, must find an efficient way to solve this issue, as we know from our own experience that it is better to see the EU once than to hear about it a hundred times.\nPERSON147 : (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, as a co-author of a question on the cost of visas for Belarus I wish to thank you for today's explanations and to draw your attention to several additional matters. The point is that Belarus is not only a close neighbour of the EU. It is also the closest one of my country, Poland, hence my concern and my intervention on behalf of the interests of those who live in that country.After Schengen enlargement you said that the cost of visas for Belarusians went up. In reality the cost went up by a factor of 12, from EUR 5 to 60. In Belarus EUR 60 is the monthly salary of a medical doctor under training. EUR 60 for many Belarusians is a real barrier preventing them from obtaining a visa and from visiting EU neighbours. We can already see that after the visa price rise there has been a visible and drastic fall in the numbers of Belarusian citizens travelling to the EU. This happened at a time when the EU wishes to establish direct contact with its citizens and when the policy of good neighbourliness is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. It is therefore a painful paradox for this country, even if it is ruled undemocratically.Please believe me that the decision to increase visa fees is an excellent present for the Lukashenka regime which discounts this politically. The regime says to Belarusians: you see? They have introduced high, prohibitive fees. Nobody is waiting for you in Europe, nobody wants you there.This needs to be changed. I value the fact that the Commissioner mentioned Poland as the country which intends to press for lower visa fees for Belarusians. However this is not a task for Poland, Lithuania and individual countries. It is a task for the entire EU. Should we be unable to solve this, how are we to build a common foreign policy within the EU? I therefore appeal to the Commission to take all the steps necessary to lower visa fees for Belarusians.\nPERSON148 : (PL) As early as May 2005 Ukraine withdrew the requirement to obtain visas for citizens of the European Union. However the EU needed as long as three years to take any position on this. I want to say that the final EU reaction was far from clear.On the one hand, early this year visas became easier to obtain, certain procedures were simplified and visa fees were waived, but only for selected groups of citizens. For most Ukrainians the European Union appears to be an impregnable fortress, opening its doors only for those who can cope patiently with the long and very expensive struggle at consulates of Schengen countries.For many Ukrainians visas are too expensive. The institutions involved in the visa issue process generally charge twice or even three times more than the set maximum fee. Secondly, the time required for a visa to be issued at many consulates is unpredictable and very long. Thirdly, many consulates require additional documents, not mentioned in the agreement. Even diplomatic passport holders may have problems at border crossings.The necessary final aim for Ukraine is a clear road map attempting to introduce bilateral visa-free travel, albeit with difficult preconditions, as was the case with Serbia.\nPERSON149 : (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Europe without borders, the European Union within Schengen, cannot mean the creation of a new wall between the EU and Eastern Europe.European dreams of a single borderless Europe have materialised within the EU. However, what is happening now on the border between the EU and Ukraine and Belarus is a political scandal of sorts for my generation - the Solidarity generation in Poland, which fought for the unity of Europe.Today the problems of reaching the European Union for the Ukrainians and Belarusians must be resolved as soon as possible. Commissioner, I appeal to you! We, Europeans in the rich, democratic countries, must do everything we can today so that the EU is open for the civil societies of Belarus and Ukraine.\nPERSON150 : (SK) Mr President, the fact that you are chairing today's debate is highly symbolic and I thank you for that.In my speeches I mention at every opportunity the request by the leaders of civil society in Ukraine and in the EU to the Member States and EU institutions, and to the Ukrainian Government and Supreme Council, for Europe to give greater consideration to the Ukraine-EU visa issue.As Ukraine is one of the European Union's strategic partners, I welcome today's debate and the information the Commissioner has provided. While I accept that this is a very demanding process, I also think that it is vital to find a solution.Visa issue involving Belarusian citizens were also examined during Belarus Week in the European Parliament at meetings with Alexander Milinkevich, the winner of the Sakharov Prize. It is our duty to help the people who are the hapless victims of Lukashenko's regime.Ladies and gentlemen, we have to adopt as quickly as possible a solution to simplify the visa regime: that will send a positive and constructive signal to the pro-European and pro-democratic forces in Ukraine and Belarus.\nPERSON151 : (PL) Mr President, the youth of Belarus is often punished by the withdrawal of the right to education for holding beliefs not liked by the authorities. Poland provides higher education places for many of these young people. We must not waste this by imposing an economic blockade on such young people who want to enter our country to study. This economic blockade should be dismantled and the visa fees should be lowered.\nPERSON152 : Before I hand over to the Commissioner - and we have a bit of time - I wish to add something. As a frequent traveller to Ukraine I wish to say that a crucial issue in the visa problem, in the entire visa regime, is explaining to the societies of Ukraine and Belarus whether what they have to go through today is a transitional stage. This applies to prices and to procedures. The prices are prohibitive and the procedures humiliating. These people queue for long hours, for dozens of hours. Is this transitional or permanent? The Ukrainians often say that a Schengen wall has been erected, that what has been introduced and greeted with joy by everybody, by us Poles, by the French, for a long time now by the Germans, is in reality just a process of natural isolation, that the queue in front of a consulate, the refusal, the price - all that is merely a signal to their societies, a signal received very negatively in the context of all the aspirations we speak so much about in this Chamber and elsewhere.The debate is closed. Please forgive me that I have broken the golden rule, that the President does not interfere in such matters, but I simply could not remain silent on this issue.\nPERSON153 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I have listened carefully to what you have just said, and it supports a great many speakers who have emphasised the need to facilitate access to the European Union for the citizens of our neighbouring countries.I believe that many have spoken with a great deal of common sense! The more opportunities there are for people-to-people exchanges, the more likely it is that citizens will influence their own country's move towards democracy and commitment to European values.Nevertheless, I must first reply on the subject of Belarus. I have explained why, so far, there have been no plans to enter into negotiations on an agreement on visa facilitation. The political situation may well change, and I should like to add that the European Union is making every effort to make its presence felt in the country, as, a few days ago, a European Commission office was set up in Belarus.At all events, as I have already said, Belarusian citizens already have the opportunity to travel within the European Union under existing EU legislation. However, I have listened carefully to all sides of the argument, and I cannot say more than I have already said regarding Belarus.As far as Ukraine is concerned, I should like to say that the situation is much more positive. The Agreement on visa fees for Ukrainian citizens stipulates that the Schengen states will charge EUR 35 for processing visa applications of Ukrainian citizens, and not EUR 60, which is considered to be the average cost of a visa. Therefore, efforts have already been made. I also mentioned that there are some categories of Ukrainian citizens who could benefit from a full waiver of the visa fee.Nevertheless, Mr President, I am acutely aware of what you have just said. The price is an issue, but, occasionally, so is the way in which these formalities have to be completed: very lengthy procedures that give these citizens the impression that the European Union is a long way off. I have to tell you that, at present, my attention is drawn to the problems faced in particular by the citizens of the Western Balkan States. I am trying to determine ways in which we can also make these procedures easier. I believe that, if we succeed, we will probably also do so in the case of countries such as Ukraine.That concludes, Mr President, what I wanted to say to Parliament, whilst being fully aware that all the Members' remarks are justifiable to some extent, but that, as things stand, some progress has already been made. It is true that a lot more remains to be done, but I also feel that each Member State should endeavour to take advantage of the opportunities that are already available. I, for one, shall be making every effort to do so.\nPERSON154 : The debate is closed."

"transcript": "PERSON294 : The next item is Question Time (B6-0231/2009).The following questions are addressed to the Commission.Subject: Competition and transparency of income taxationDoes the Commission consider the maintenance of non-transparent systems of income taxation within the European Union to be compatible with free competition and if not, what steps does it intend to take to put a stop to such systems in Member States or parts of Member States?\nPERSON296 : Member of the Commission. - Let me first recall that Member States are, under Community law, largely free to design their direct tax systems in a way that best meets their domestic policy objectives and requirements. But in recent years they have reached common agreement on several measures proposed by the Commission that are designed to tackle the erosion of tax bases and investment allocation distortions. In doing so, Member States have acknowledged that EU-wide cooperation and fair tax competition rules are vital to protect revenues.On the question of transparency raised by an honourable Member of Parliament, I would like to recall that very recently, on 28 April 2009, the European Commission adopted a communication identifying actions in order to promote good governance in the tax area, which means transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition.Firstly the communication identifies how good governance in the tax area could be improved within the European Union so as to reinforce the argument for other jurisdictions to follow. It calls on Member States to swiftly adopt Commission proposals for directives on administrative cooperation and mutual assistance in the recovery of taxes and savings taxation. Member States should also continue to give appropriate priority to eliminating harmful business tax regimes. More specifically, the Commission's proposal on administrative cooperation contains a provision according to which bank secrecy could no longer be invoked to deny a request for information from another Member State relating to persons non-resident in the requested Member State. This is entirely in line with international consensus on tax information exchange.Secondly, in order to enhance the promotion of good governance beyond the European Union, the communication suggests how to ensure better coherence between EU policies with a view to ensuring that the deepening of economic relations between the European Union and its partner jurisdictions would be accompanied by a commitment to good governance principles. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring support for developing countries which have committed to the good governance principles.The communication also proposes ways of ensuring more coherence between Member States' individual policy positions in the international tax area and agreed good governance principles. This would notably include, where appropriate, a coordinated response to jurisdictions that refuse to apply good governance principles. Today the Commission presented the communication to the EU ministers of finance at the Ecofin meeting, with a view to seeking their support on the proposed approach for the last Ecofin meeting of the Czech Presidency in June 2009.\nPERSON297 : (ES) Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. You have addressed a number of aspects, such as transparency; what I missed in your speech was a reference to recent agreements in the framework of the G20, concerning the fight against tax havens and so-called 'non-cooperative jurisdictions'. Is the Commission contributing to the G20 proposal or has it remained entirely on the fringes of this type of negotiation?\nPERSON298 : Member of the Commission. - The Commission is a full participant in the G20 and is participating fully in this process.I have already mentioned some of the measures the Commission would like to encourage Member States to take. It is fully involved in the G20 process.\nPERSON299 : (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in principle I am against the introduction of new taxes. They affect, above all, the middle class. They affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment.However, we must consider taxes in conjunction with short-term stock profits. Do you envisage that taxes on short-term stock profits gained from naked short selling will be earmarked for the creation of new jobs?\nPERSON300 : Could the Commissioner please reassure the House that he is firmly committed to all direct taxation - income tax and corporation tax - being firmly left a Member State competence? Please confirm that is your view.\nPERSON301 : Member of the Commission. - Well, there is a Treaty and the Treaty is very clear. We know that there will be a new Irish referendum perhaps on the Lisbon Treaty, but these Articles are very clear on how the competences are divided in text, and the Commission has no intention of writing a new treaty with different responsibilities.This is also partly the answer on using tax policy for creating jobs. As different countries are in different situations, a Europe-wide taxation instrument will not perhaps achieve the same goals as in a particular Member State.Taxation instruments are sometimes good to really create incentives or develop the economy, but this is very much dependent on the situation in particular Member States.Subject: EU earthquake policy: actions taken by the Commission in the wake of the recent catastrophic earthquake in ItalyIn November 2007 Parliament adopted resolution (P6_TA(2007)0507) on an integrated approach to earthquakes by the EU (prevention, response and repairing damage) in which it called for the adoption of specific measures as regards a policy for protection, reinforcing buildings (with special emphasis on buildings of historic and cultural significance), funding, research, public information, etc.Furthermore, in my letters to the Environment Commissioner (10.1.2008) and the Commission President (22.5.2008) I have drawn attention to the urgent need to draw up a communication devoted specially and exclusively to the effective management of responses to earthquakes.In the wake of the recent deadly earthquake in Italy, does the Commission take the view that it is covered by its written answer of 22.7.2008 and the answers furnished by Mr Barroso and Mr Dimas or does it intend to take further initiatives to protect European citizens from earthquakes?\nPERSON303 : Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, the Commission is fully committed to helping to protect people from earthquakes. This protection must form part of an integrated approach to dealing with situations which may be caused by various dangers. The Commission recently adopted a communication entitled 'A Community approach on the prevention of natural and manmade disasters' which also covers earthquakes. This communication follows on from the actions taken by the Commission over recent years, which are in line with many of the recommendations formulated by the European Parliament in its resolution in 2007. This specific action relates in particular to the dissemination of best practices, the development of joint approaches to risk evaluation, mapping and education and awareness-raising, while at the same time seeking to improve the cohesion of and synergies between financial and legislative means of prevention which already exist, thereby strengthening the added value of action by the European Union. The Commission will make every possible effort to moderate the impact of earthquakes by encouraging the Member States to fully integrate the common European planning codes for buildings and public works, especially Eurocode 8, into their national regulations. The Commission awaits the response of the European Parliament to the approach proposed in its communication with particular interest.\nPERSON304 : (EL) Madam President, I am sorry, but the question remains. I honestly do not understand: why does the Commission refuse to do for earthquakes what it did for floods? What is the difference? In fact, I am very surprised that this debate is being held after the recent disaster in Italy. As regards the last communication to which you referred, it mentions earthquakes in passing at three points, to which you referred. Do you honestly believe that a reference to earthquakes at three points in a communication suffices to counterbalance the huge need which we have in Europe for a communication specifically on earthquakes? I would honestly like to have an answer.\nPERSON305 : \u039cember of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, the communication which we released in February 2009 takes an integrated approach to the overall question, regardless of the source of the danger. We consider that this approach is the best. As far as floods are concerned, we have a communication on water scarcity and drought. There are communications on specific dangers or specific problems which exist, but we consider that the integrated approach which we want to use is the most appropriate.We await Parliament's response and, if there are important reasons why we should abandon this approach, then we shall consider them. However, I must say to you that the Commission communication will also help a little in preventing the consequences of earthquakes.As such, it is addressed at the Member States, which jealously guard the principle of subsidiarity as regards competence for this matter, so that they will incorporate the provisions of the European Union on buildings into their national laws, be they the provisions of Eurocode 8 for new buildings, or the provisions on strengthening buildings for old buildings. Let them do so, let them take certain other actions which are needed, such as strict compliance with planning regulations, in order to prevent most of the disasters.\nPERSON306 : (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, connected to the fault line through the Apennines, there is another fault line which crosses Slovenia. As you perhaps know, the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant is situated on this fault line. On our initiative several warning devices have been installed there. What measures do you plan to take, following this devastating earthquake in Italy, to guarantee the security of the Kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant, which stands on a fault line connected to this. Do you think that you might take precautionary measures, which might go so far as closing Kr\u0161ko?\nPERSON307 : (EL) Madam President, I too am surprised by the position expressed by the Commission here today because, of course, we respect the reply as regards the question of subsidiarity and I absolutely agree with the specific demands, but that does not resolve the question of a collective political proposal on the part of the European Commission which includes all aspects of disasters caused by earthquakes. Mr Pirker added yet another and, of course, we shall find others. The question therefore remains: why, over and beyond the principle of subsidiarity and the specific measures mentioned by the Commissioner, do we not have a global proposal on the part of the European Commission?\nPERSON308 : Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, as I said earlier, we await the response of the European Parliament to the communication we have issued on earthquake prevention. Once we have a response, we shall examine if this approach or the other approach is better. In particular, there are specific provisions for nuclear installations and there is the Seveso II directive for industry.Subject: Solar thermal electricity and the Economic Recovery PlanIn a bid to tackle the serious energy and economic challenges facing the European Union, in its recovery package the Commission has proposed measures designed to contribute to both economic recovery and energy objectives. However, solar thermal electricity (STE) - one of the most promising renewable energy sources - is not included in the list of sectors which stand to benefit.Moreover, European industry is currently the world leader in this area, but it can only maintain this position if the domestic market expands and if further R&D is promoted.Can the Commission please comment on why the STE sector has been excluded from the strong financial boosts provided in the recovery plan? What other sources of funding are available to the sector?\nPERSON310 : Member of the Commission. - Solar-thermal electricity was never excluded from the European Economic Recovery Plan. It was not included for the reason that we addressed the most urgent energy needs. That means that we looked at the issues where the crisis has had the greatest impact and where projects could not materialise.The first question was interconnection. Any power production, especially from new energy sources, cannot function if there are grid issues. So we addressed as a matter of urgency the electricity grids and interconnection between member countries.On top of that we have had the gas crisis, which clearly showed that in some cases missing physical infrastructure has a huge impact as regards gas supply disruption. This is the easiest way to respond to the security of gas supplies.And we addressed two other issues which I think would definitely be postponed if they did not have support from the Community: firstly, offshore wind energy, which is rather a large project that needs to be connected to the mainland grid, and, secondly, carbon capture and storage, where we really need to encourage industry to come with a full-scale project as soon as possible.For this reason we have not considered other eligible areas. That is why it was not included, not because I do not believe in it. I believe in solar thermal energy but we addressed the most urgent needs.What sources are available to support the further evolution of solar thermal electricity? First there is the seventh framework programme. We have EUR 2.35 billion for the years 2007-2013. Second, it is one area where you can provide the tool. From next year we have an opportunity to provide 300 million emission allowances for new entrants. Renewable energy projects, such as solar thermal electricity, are eligible. So if the projects are there they are very welcome.We can also use funds from the European Regional Development Fund. We encourage more use of synergy energy sources; in particular we increased the limits of how much renewable energy could be used in relation to housing and energy efficiency. So overall eligibility for these measures has been increased.On top of this, in the summer or early autumn, the Commission will table a new communication on financing low-carbon technologies. We will try to elaborate on it so that these technologies get support, not only from the Community budget but also from industry and the Member States, so that this support is targeted and so that we get the new technological development very quickly to achieve our goal of 20% renewable energy by 2020, but perhaps we can be even more ambitious in this respect.So we have not excluded it. It is just that we have a lot of areas that we need to address and we have taken the most urgent areas where money needs to be invested now.\nPERSON311 : Thank you, Commissioner, for a very full reply. I have noted carefully what you have said.In the event that any of the projects which have been nominated specifically under the Recovery Plan are not in a position to draw down the funding by the deadline of 30 June 2010, will you have what I will refer to as a reserve list of projects that are ready to go, so that the money will actually go into this sector, to energy efficiency and low energy?In the solar thermal area, for example, they have major projects ready to start construction at the end of 2009 and early 2010; they have several projects ready to go. Could we have a reserve list so that all this money is used in the event of those who have been allocated at the moment not being in a position to draw it down?\nPERSON312 : Member of the Commission. - In establishing the list we looked at the majority of the projects and we also involved the Member States, so at this stage I have no reason to believe that we will be unable to disburse or commit all the money.If there should be some delays, or if some projects are not sufficiently prepared, we will have a report in March 2010. So, if there is a possibility that part of the money is available, I promised at trialogues that the Commission will consider, if appropriate, making a necessary proposal. But it is premature to promise it because it depends how well we can commit the money, as today there are a limited number of projects where we believe that they have advanced enough to use this money.Subject: Nuclear power stationsAccording to the Institute of Energy of South East Europe, many EU countries and other countries from southern and eastern regions and eastern Mediterranean countries engaged in accession negotiations are examining schemes to extend or construct nuclear power stations to generate electricity. Will the Commission say what actions and initiatives it intends to take to impose pre-conditions and restrictions in respect of these initiatives, bearing in mind the special geological characteristics, climatic conditions and the possibilities for funding these schemes and their viability?\nPERSON314 : Member of the Commission. - Well, my colleague Stavros Dimas has already replied to a supplementary question on this issue.Basically, nuclear energy is established in a way that means that each country has a nuclear safety regulator who has full responsibility for implementing nuclear safety measures. At the same time, each Member State decides whether or not to use nuclear energy. This is subject to the Euratom Treaty, and very clearly there are additional requirements. The additional requirements are that each project that is submitted is also analysed by the Commission and we make a recommendation on the projects to be developed. We did that in the case of Belene and also of Mochovce.There is also a clear obligation that the requirements of the environmental impact assessment should be fulfilled, as laid down in Community law, and the additional requirements of the UN/ECE Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context will also be applicable.So whatever project is being proposed, we are not discriminating between Member States. There are clear requirements to be fulfilled and each project is analysed on its own merits, based on the Community acquis and on environmental legislation. I can assure you that this process is so watertight that no permission has ever been given to build a nuclear power installation unless all the safety requirements can be guaranteed.\nPERSON315 : (EL) Madam President, I should like to ask, in connection with what the Commissioner said about the evaluation of every proposal, if an ex-ante study can be carried out for the area in question, including on the basis of EuroMediterranean cooperation and the particular character of the area, so that there are criteria which every country will have to take into account from the beginning and comply with in their planning.\nPERSON316 : Member of the Commission. - First of all, each and every country develops its own legislation that decides on the process of how the application should be made. Later, the process very much relates to, and is based on, the national legislation and Euratom legislation. As a result, we cannot take a regional approach. We need to look at the specific situation in each and every Member State and, at the same time, each and every project.We cannot just consider an average situation in the region and say that this region is not suitable for using nuclear power. That would be untrue because you cannot develop a project that could be used in more or less every place. It is a question of the costs, conditions and time needed. So, we cannot go with a regional approach. We really need to look at each and every concrete project because only in this way can we guarantee full safety in this project.\nPERSON317 : (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on the nuclear package which you have just tabled and which, in particular, concerns new nuclear power plants, as well as the proposal that, in future, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) standards should be binding.I would be interested to know whether you think you could prepare a proposal for an EU regulatory authority or the upgrading of WENRA to a body for issuing binding standards in the next legislative period, and whether we could also make IAEO standards compulsory for all Member States.\nPERSON318 : Member of the Commission. - On the second part, I believe that, with this high-level group of nuclear regulators, we can move forward with stronger standards. This is just the point of departure; it was the lowest common denominator we could have developed.At the same time, because of the sensitivity of the issue - politically and also, sometimes, culturally - I strongly doubt that the European regulator could play the role required. I would not say the European regulator could not be trusted, but that regulator needs to keep a distance from nuclear power installations. I believe that full responsibility for safety should lie at all times with a national regulator, because that is the best way and that will always avoid the debate of whether the central regulator is pushing hard enough for nuclear energy etc.It is good to establish a common framework, but responsibility must remain with all the regulators who, as is proposed in the nuclear safety directive, have full powers and all the necessary instruments to implement this policy. We have very good nuclear safety regulators in the Union, so an organisational shake-up is not necessary. We just need to increase the binding standards, starting from the level we have now, and working together, thus demonstrating to the world that standards can be increased in the nuclear industry.Subject: Promoting sustainable energy in citiesIn my own home city of Cork, local authorities and businesses are striving towards the creation of sustainable energy policies. What is the Commission doing to support cities like Cork in their efforts to promote sustainable energy?\nPERSON320 : Member of the Commission. - I am very glad that you put this question, because I am very proud of one of our achievements, and that is the Covenant of Mayors.In 2008 we supported the initiative from cities to have a Covenant of Mayors. This means that cities make a binding obligation to reduce CO2 by more than 20% by 2020. They develop sustainable energy action plans for this. They have also founded a Covenant of Mayors' Office for coordination and promotion. We support these actions through the Joint Research Centre, to provide scientific background and technical support for the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the sustainable energy action plans. For smaller municipalities, the Commission negotiates with other national, regional and local administrations to ensure their support for the smaller cities.An advanced system of good practice, the Benchmarks of Excellence, is also intended to be implemented this year.We have also created a financial support facility through the European Investment Bank (EIB), in which we place the grants, and also use the EIB to target sustainable development in the cities. The EIB has already been involved in specific projects, such as with Barcelona, on which negotiations are quite advanced.I know that the City of Cork has not yet signed this Covenant, so it is still up to the City of Cork to use this opportunity. It is a good way to really mobilise citizens behind these initiatives.At the same time there are also other instruments for sustainable development, and the cohesion policy provides significant support to cities to implement sustainable energy policies and actions. In total, for the period 2007-2013, EUR 9 billion from cohesion policy funds will be directly invested in sustainable energy initiatives in the EU. The Southern and Eastern Operational Programme, which includes the City of Cork, will invest EUR 669 million in the region and contribute to reaching Lisbon growth and jobs objectives.These cohesion funds will directly support sustainable energy projects in the region, and will help to mobilise further national investment. Funding may be used to stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy production, the development of efficient energy management systems and the promotion of clean and sustainable public transport, particularly in urban areas.The Operational Programme includes the 'Gateway Challenge Fund', which is based on an integrated sustainable development strategy for Cork.Finally, the Regional Development Fund was recently changed to give all Member States the possibility to use regional funds for energy efficiency improvements and the integration of renewable energy into existing housing. This can be as much as 4% of the total Regional Fund allocation.So, to summarise, I believe that we have created a framework for cities that share an ambition to develop sustainable models for their citizens, and that is the Covenant of Mayors. The Covenant of Mayors includes sympathisers like New York and Rochester, and has participants from other non-EU countries, so it offers a lot of knowledge through the office we operate.As concerns financial support, we do not at this stage have any programme dedicated to energy efficiency, but we have the Structural Funds, we have an Intelligent Energy Europe programme and we have also the European Investment Bank. We are using all those instruments to support these initiatives. The European Investment Bank is very active in this process. However, at this stage it is not so much an issue of finance, but more about good projects and really dedicated policy from the cities.That is my answer to your very important question. I believe that cities have every opportunity to lead the way towards a sustainable energy future.\nPERSON321 : Thank you to Commissioner Piebalgs for his response. Commissioner, you have already pointed out in your response that there is a saving in economic terms because of the efficiency in energy, but now we need to move on to the next step. Rather than just promoting sustainability and energy efficiency, we need to utilise the funds to create new ways of creating energy to make cities even more self-sufficient, rather than importing fuel or building nuclear power stations, as we were saying previously. We need to find cleverer and better ways, and maybe you might look in the future not just to the investment bank but to new ideas coming from the Commission as well.\nPERSON322 : Member of the Commission. - We are trying to respond to this request. We are planning, by the end of this year, to develop a new energy efficiency action plan that will address this. We are also drawing up a communication on the financing of low-carbon energy sources.It is very important for stakeholders to take the initiative, and I expect cities to put forward proposals and put pressure on Members of the European Parliament and on Member States to create Europe-wide instruments in the areas concerned.Without this bottom-up approach, we will fail to use the opportunities that exist. European cities are so diverse, and there are so many good ideas, that we should not just try to apply a top-down approach to each and every city.I believe that the Covenant of Mayors will provide much-needed intellectual input and experience to the policies we need to formulate to achieve sustainable cities. It is not only about savings. There are many issues involved. It is also about smart grids, the integration of renewable energy and sustainable transport - hydrogen buses, electric vehicles. There are plenty of opportunities.Each and every city could make its own programme, because what the Covenant of Mayors has done is make an obligation to reduce CO2 by more than 20%. That does not necessarily mean through energy efficiency. It could be a completely different policy area. It very much depends on local circumstances.\nPERSON323 : In view of the time I am afraid I will not take the further supplementary question. I am sorry, Mr R\u00fcbig, but you have had one question already and the Commissioner has given us some very full answers.Subject: The economic crisis and avoiding protectionismAs our Trade Commissioner you have rightly said that we must avoid protectionism in our response to the current economic crisis, as it is widely acknowledged that we will not get out of this economic downturn through restricting trade.In what ways is the Commission working to prevent the growth of protectionist tendencies in its international trade negotiations? Can any progress be reported with regards to completing the Doha Round?Additionally, how will the Commission ensure that the promotion of open trade is balanced with the EU's development priorities, such as core labour standards and environmental sustainability?\nPERSON325 : Member of the Commission. - Since the outbreak of the economic crisis, the European Union has taken a firm stance against straight protectionism, consistent with its commitment to fair and open trade.The Commission is intensively monitoring protectionist measures put in place by its major trading partners with a view to appropriate action. Furthermore, the EU has strongly supported the initiative of the World Trade Organisation to report on trade-related developments during the economic and financial crisis.Since the beginning of the current crisis, more than ever the EU has been committed to multilateralism, to transparency and to open markets based on rules that benefit developed and developing countries alike. The EU has consistently argued that an ambitious and balanced Doha Round outcome is among the most important instruments in preventing trade protectionism and in boosting the economy.This is also the message put forward by the WTO in the recent trade policy review of the EU trade policy, which praised the role played by the EU in strengthening the multilateral trading system. The key role the Doha Round could play in the current crisis was also recognised in the G20 global plan for recovery and reform issued on 2 April. The G20 leaders expressed their renewed commitment to reaching a swift conclusion of the Doha Round.Finally, the EU's commitment to open trade goes hand in hand with its commitment to sustainable development, which is an overarching policy objective for the EU, including in the context of various trade policy initiatives.Sustainable development and, in particular, environmental and social considerations are important components in our trade policy. This is witnessed by the inclusion of sustainable development provisions focusing on labour and environmental standards in our bilateral trade agreements.\nPERSON326 : Thank you, Commissioner, and I am conscious that you are standing in for Commissioner Ashton. I want to congratulate the Commission, and indeed Members in this House who are on the Committee on International Trade, for pushing the line of discouraging protectionist tendencies.I should like to ask about the issue relating to developing countries and how we can ensure that we increase or facilitate trade both with and between developing countries, for example via increased trade-related assistance. This is an important component that we should factor in. Overall, I have seen very encouraging activity from the Commission and Parliament in relation to protectionist tendencies, which would be a retrograde step.\nPERSON327 : Member of the Commission. - Reports by the WTO and the Commission's own monitoring show that there is no imminent risk of a generalised protectionist escalation. None of the large trading nations has yet resorted to across-the-board restrictions on trade and investment. Developments in certain countries - for instance, Russia, Indonesia and Argentina - need close monitoring as these countries have until now been the greatest users of border measures to restrict trade. Overall, the most targeted sectors are agriculture and food products, iron and steel, metal, automobiles, textiles and toys.\nPERSON328 : Does the Commission accept that as well as lecturing others and monitoring others to avoid the risk of protectionism we should be careful ourselves and make sure that when we use our trade defence instruments they are for the purposes for which they are intended and not as protectionist measures?\nPERSON329 : Member of the Commission. - The Commission is doing everything possible to ensure that this monitoring is strong in every aspect, especially on the issue that you raised. I could convey the message to Commissioner Ashton in order to have a more specific view and a more specific answer. But so far there are no disturbing signals.Subject: Internet piracy CanadaCanada has one of the world's highest levels of Internet piracy. This is exacerbated by serious legislative and enforcement deficiencies. In fact, Canada's Copyright Act is in urgent need of revision in order to bring it into line with current international standards of protection in the on-line environment, such as those laid down in the WIPO Internet Treaties of 1996 and the EU Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC). The longer this situation lasts, the longer European rights holders - in particular the creative sector (authors, composers, performers, songwriters and phonogram producers) - will be deprived of the legal tools they need to stop the large-scale online infringement of their rights in Canada. Their losses to Internet piracy are huge. The situation is such that legislative action needs to be taken now rather than after the upcoming EU-Canada Trade Summit in May and subsequent bilateral trade negotiations.Given the urgency of this issue, what is the Commission doing to ensure that Canada amends its relevant legislation without any further delay?\nPERSON331 : Member of the Commission. - The Commission is aware of the issues raised in relation to Canada's intellectual property rights protection and enforcement. We are extremely concerned that Canada's proposed reform of its Copyright Act appears to be being given so little priority.Reasonable protection of intellectual property rights is essential for the future survival of the creative industries. While several Member States are now eagerly discussing how intellectual property rights can better be adapted to the online world, we must indeed still pay attention to the risks of internet piracy originating from third countries.One of the key issues in play is how to strike a fair balance between the interests of rights holders and those of consumers, while respecting data protection rules. You will remember that this was a key debating point of the Commission Creative Content Online initiative launched by the Communication of 3 January 2008.The Commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the Canadian authorities for quite some time now. The fact we will soon start negotiations for a free trade agreement with Canada will give us a new opportunity to bring about significant improvement of IPR protection in Canada. In the mean time, the Commission will be taking the matter up with the Canadian authorities at the highest level. It will also call for the revision of Canadian copyright law to be initiated as soon as possible and preferably during the Parliament's present session.\nPERSON332 : (GA) Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for that answer. But I would like to ask a question - how hopeful is the Commission that the effort they are making in relation to Canada will succeed and what are the direct plans the Commission has to stop piracy on the Internet and this practice? If we are unable to stop it with a country like Canada, what chance do we have in other cases?\nPERSON333 : Member of the Commission. - As I said before, a trade agreement will provide the legal framework with which to address some of the EU's trade irritants and issues with Canada, such as its IPR enforcement standards and certain anti-competitive practices. We are optimistic since we will have negotiations on an FTA.Subject: Korea FTAFollowing the recent discussions between the Commission and the South Korean Trade Ministry, can the Commission outline the state of play of the EU-Korea FTA negotiations?\nPERSON335 : Member of the Commission. - The negotiations on a free trade agreement with Korea are the most advanced of the EU's ongoing trade negotiations. After two years of negotiations, we now have a comprehensive agreement within reach with the EU's fourth-largest trading partner outside Europe.The free trade agreement with Korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to EU exporters. By way of illustration: the agreement would swiftly eliminate EUR 1.6 billion of customs duties to the benefit of EU exporters; it would offer solid disciplines on non-tariff barriers in priority sectors such as the automotive, pharmaceutical, or consumer electrics sectors; it would provide significant new market access in services of special interest to EU service providers; it would offer the most ambitious package yet on intellectual property rights, government procurement, sustainable development and other rules issues; and it would foresee novel ways of involving civil society in the monitoring of how the free trade agreement is implemented, and protect our sensitivities with appropriate arrangements.The free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations. Moreover, concluding that agreement now would demonstrate the commitment of both sides to open markets as one response to the current economic environment.At the end of the eighth round of negotiations in March 2009, both sides made important technical progress at their level, but a certain number of difficult issues remained unresolved.EU Trade Commissioner Ashton and Korean Trade Minister Kim subsequently met in London on 2 April 2009. Despite intensive discussions, it was not possible to bridge gaps on the remaining issues, such as duty drawback and rules of origin.The Commission is currently consulting on the best way forward.\nPERSON336 : Thank you, Commissioner, for that response. Firstly, I entirely agree that a free trade agreement with Korea would bring enormous benefits both to the European Union and to Korea, and would send a positive signal in terms of our determination to keep markets open. However, failure to reach this agreement now looks like it lies more with the Member States than with our negotiating partner.That being the case, if we cannot reach an agreement with Korea, would the Commission accept that DG Trade might as well pack up and go home as regards free trade agreements, because if we cannot agree with Korea we are not going to agree with India, ASEAN or on any other such agreements we are negotiating?\nPERSON337 : Member of the Commission. - In contrast, the Member States have recently confirmed their interest in concluding an ambitious and balanced agreement with Korea.As usual, the Commission will defend the principles on the basis of which we negotiate with all countries.\nPERSON338 : Thank you very much. Maybe the Commissioner would comment on the situation of the German Government on this matter.Like Mr Martin, I am a supporter of this free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea. However, we do need to be careful about details and timing. It is estimated that 650 000 Korean cars would sell in Europe per annum. While there is already some production in eastern Europe, there will be a significant volume of new imports.Most surveys indicate that these will substitute the sales of Japanese cars produced in Europe, like those produced by the Honda plant in my constituency in Swindon. This plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby. In order not to exacerbate the current situation here and elsewhere in Europe, will you ensure that there is a serious time lag before such imports are allowed?\nPERSON339 : Member of the Commission. - I understand your concerns about the situation in the car industry. From the start of negotiations with Korea, the Commission has invested considerable resources in obtaining a good result for the EU car industry. European car exporters will benefit from a combination of the elimination of Korean duties on cars and the effective removal of technical barriers. The most substantial barriers will be removed from day one of the agreement.Subject: US-EU trade dispute concerning hormone-treated beefWill the Commission provide information concerning the outcome of the negotiations it is conducting with the US authorities with a view to definitively preventing - following the decision for a temporary suspension - the activation of the so-called carousel retaliatory measures as part of the transatlantic trade dispute on hormone-treated beef and revoking the retaliatory measures already in place?\nPERSON341 : Member of the Commission. - The Commission is currently still engaged in negotiations with the United States, and we are very optimistic that a mutually acceptable solution can emerge very soon. In the last few weeks we had intensive transatlantic contacts on this issue. The EU Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton and US Trade Representative Ron Kirk agreed on 22 April to hold further talks in order to find a negotiated solution to the long-running dispute over hormone-treated beef.They confirmed their wish to resolve this difficult issue that affects businesses and consumers in both the EU and the US and, in order to facilitate the negotiations for a solution, Commissioner Ashton and US Trade Representative Kirk agreed that the imposition of the so-called 'Carousel' sanctions by the US on certain EU products would be postponed by a further two weeks beyond the original 23 April deadline.The Commission is committed to doing its best to find a positive and lasting solution to this issue, and talks are currently being held by senior officials from both sides. The Commission's final objectives in these negotiations are to definitively prevent activation of the 'Carousel' sanctions and to have the retaliatory measures currently in place revoked. We are confident that an agreement is within reach that would fully safeguard our public health and consumer protection objectives in this issue.\nPERSON342 : (EL) Madam President, in the absence of the competent Commissioner, Mrs Ashton, I should like to thank Commissioner Kuneva for her reply and to ask the Commissioner to convey my thanks to Mrs Ashton for mediating and consulting with the American side on the lifting of the carousel retaliatory measures being taken by the United States of America. This is an action which, if nothing else, goes one step further, goes beyond the limits of the partnership between the United States of America and the European Union, which are two principal commercial players which also play a leading role in the framework of negotiations under the Doha round under the aegis of the World Trade Organization.\nPERSON343 : Member of the Commission. - Mr Papastamkos, I shall gladly convey your message to Commissioner Ashton and, without going too far in what I am saying, I think the results will be really quite satisfactory.Subject: Non-compliance by airlines with Regulation No. 261/2004The Court of Justice of the European Communities delivered a judgment on 22 December 2008 pursuant to which an airline may not refuse to compensate passengers following the cancellation of a flight because of technical problems affecting the aircraft. A Swedish court before which a case was brought by the ombudsman has just given a similar ruling.Could the Commission indicate to what extent it will take account of these rulings which once again demonstrate the reluctance on the part of the airlines, the overly vague wording of Regulation No. 261/2004 concerning the 'extraordinary circumstances' justifying a cancellation and the passivity of the Commission in the face of numerous violations of this regulation to the detriment of passengers?\nPERSON345 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that first of all we need to emphasise that it is not the Commission's job to interpret Court of Justice rulings. These rulings referred to questions referred for preliminary rulings by national courts with the aim of ensuring uniform application of Community law.Under the terms of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on passenger rights in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, Member States are responsible for applying the regulation and are obliged to prosecute airlines that do not comply with the provisions. When processing passenger claims that are sent to them, the competent national authorities, appointed by Member States in accordance with the regulation, must evidently take into account the instructions provided by the Court of Justice. The Commission's role is that of monitoring the correct implementation of the regulation by the competent authorities, particularly in the light of relevant Court of Justice rulings.The last meeting between the Commission and the competent national authorities was held at the beginning of December last year, in other words a few weeks before the Court of Justice's decision. The Commission has planned another meeting for the 14th of this month. During this meeting, the Court of Justice's recent decision over case C-549/07 will be examined.National authorities will have an opportunity to comment on the ruling and describe how they assess the behaviour of airlines to passengers in the event of cancellation in the light of this precedent and also the practical consequences of the ruling.\nPERSON346 : (IT) Commissioner, thank you because I feel that due attention must be paid to this matter. As far as I have understood, Member States must handle these matters, but you can also see if anything can be done. Thank you, therefore, for your answer and we look forward to seeing what happens next.\nPERSON347 : Thank you for having spoken in Italian. I know that you are of Italian origin, so once again, thank you. The Commission will of course monitor what is happening because I believe that passenger rights are very important to all of us. This is one of the aims of my work as Commissioner.I said this at the time when my appointment was approved by Parliament. I will therefore continue to ensure that monitoring is carried out in order to check whether Member States are respecting passenger rights. We are all committed, even Mrs Kuneva, to trying to effectively defend the rights of citizens in all areas.\nPERSON348 : I will be brief, as I realise there is very little time. Commissioner, I have to say that the implementation of the rights we have are, frankly, a joke at the moment. I was recently in Amsterdam and watched KLM dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check-in. The staff systematically, without asking the passengers, declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to.Can we have some monitoring by the Commission? Can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do? Because, frankly, it seems to me that it has become a joke.\nPERSON349 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, the Commission intends to report to Parliament and the Council on the functioning and results of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 through a communication, which should be adopted in the second half of this year.This document will analyse four years of the Regulation's functioning and will propose any other actions to be taken in order to reduce the number of incidents and improve the protection of air passengers' rights.All airports will therefore be checked. I hope that the Commission's work will improve the situation and provide citizens with the answers they expect. I can therefore assure you of my commitment as Commissioner. I have started, and I will continue, and I can confirm my commitment.Subject: Airline privatisations in the EUGiven the successful model used for privatising Olympic Airways and transferring it to a private investor, will the Commission say to what extent this model could be used for other airlines facing similar problems?How does the Commission assess the prospects for future privatisations of airlines in the EU? How much do airline mergers contribute to addressing the crisis, without creating monopolies and reducing competition?\nPERSON351 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the opinion that you expressed in the text of your question, in other words that the Commission's decisions have obviously led to the ordered sale of some Olympic Airlines and Olympic Airways Services businesses. These have certainly been successful with regard to competition and transport policy.Alitalia used the same model and it could be used by all airlines that find themselves in serious difficulties. This decision has therefore led to the creation of a new airline model, what ought to be the airline of the future: no more state companies but fully privatised companies. This is the work that the Commission has attempted to support. I believe this aim of privatisation is also shared by other airlines, I am thinking of Austrian Airlines, Malev and Czech Airlines.In accordance with the treaty, the Commission must nevertheless remain neutral with regard to the public or private ownership of companies. The Commission is favourable to consolidation of the Community air sector, which it still considers to be too fragmented, particularly in view of the current crisis.This consolidation should not, however, hinder competition to the extent of impairing the effective operation of the common market. The Commission or the competent national authority is responsible for monitoring concentrations carried out for this purpose under the terms of the relevant Community regulation, depending on the magnitude of the relevant concentration operation.\nPERSON352 : (EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his comments and reply. I should like to take advantage of the Commissioner's presence to ask him if there have been any evaluations on the part of the Commission on the loss of jobs in European aviation companies over the last eight months since the economic crisis broke and, if there are, what measures do you believe could be used to reverse the situation?\nPERSON353 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have any definite data on job losses due to the crisis, but I am certainly well aware of what is happening in the air transport sector.All my efforts as Commissioner for Transport have been directed towards supporting this form of transport and it comes as no surprise that we are again discussing a question, the matter of slots, that aims to prevent the airline situation from worsening in this time of crisis: this also means seeking to reduce job losses, in other words to contain employment levels within the European Union in the air transport sector.Subject: Rail artery for Europe and the Brenner base tunnelCan the Commission provide detailed information on the precise timetable and financial plans concerning both the leg of the high speed rail link for Europe from Strasbourg to Vienna and the Brenner base tunnel as the centrepiece of the Berlin-Rome link? What further steps are planned and are any additional opportunities provided by the recovery plan?\nPERSON355 : Madam President, Mr Posselt, as you know, the Berlin-Palermo rail axis is one of the 30 priority transEuropean transport network projects and the Brenner base tunnel project is the centrepiece of this priority project.The Commission supports this key element of the priority project that will make it possible to connect rail networks at both sides of the Alps by means of a highcapacity, high-speed line, mainly designed for goods transport. The project will therefore contribute both to the effective operation of the internal market and environmental targets and to economic recovery.The Commission therefore wishes to meet citizens' expectations in practice. This is another reason why we accelerated the granting of finance at the end of last year once authorisation had been given for EUR 786 million of funding for priority project No 1. The coordinator Mrs van Miert has been monitoring the project since 2005, I believe with positive results.We have currently started a consultation process with the EU Member States in order to renew the mandate of the European coordinators and thus cover the period 2009-2013. In this way, we will be able to allow them to carry on with their work, particularly that of monitoring the priority projects. On 22 March 2009, the Austrian authorities submitted their multiannual programme for infrastructures, which includes financing of the Brenner base tunnel. On 17 April 2009, following the completion of the environmental impact assessment, they issued a construction permit for the project.The Italian authorities, for their part, submitted their base tunnel project to their Inter-ministerial Economic Programming Committee (CIPE) so that the funding could be approved in May. Minister Matteoli, with whom I have spoken, confirms the will of the Italian state to pursue the objective, in other words to finance the project, and I believe that the Austrian and Italian authorities are in absolute agreement on this matter.Priority project 17 - the Strasbourg-Vienna high-speed link that forms part of the Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava rail axis - is proceeding in a satisfactory manner in all the Member States involved: France, Germany, Austria and Slovakia. Most of the 831 km stretch between Strasbourg and Vienna - more specifically the Strasbourg-Stuttgart and Linz-Vienna sections - will be complete by 2015. The Stuttgart-Ulm section, which represents the most significant bottleneck, will be complete by 2020.The relevant finance protocol will be signed on 2 April of this year. At the moment, the most complicated section seems to be the cross-border section in Bavaria between Munich and Salzburg. The German Government is currently conducting a review of its multiannual programming, and so we will have to wait until the end of this year before we can begin discussing this very important section. The Strasbourg-Vienna section will cost EUR 10 billion and the priority project will cost EUR 13.5 billion in total.I believe that this information may be of use and covers all of the requests made in Mr Posselt's question.\nPERSON356 : (DE) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your very good and detailed answer and also for your excellent work on these two important projects which cross in Munich. I have just two brief supplementary questions:Firstly, there is a rumour regarding the Brenner Base Tunnel, that it might be reduced to passenger transport. Can you rule this out?Secondly, in Austria and in Stuttgart a great deal is being done for the main route from Strasbourg to Vienna and Budapest. However, we have the problem of the Munich bypass, the Munich airport link and the stretch from Munich to M\u00fchldorf, Freilassing and Salzburg, so the Chemical Triangle and the stretch via M\u00fchldorf. I would like to draw your attention to this in particular, as progress here is still very slow.\nPERSON357 : Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, as far as the Berlin-Palermo link is concerned, I can reassure you that although there are bound to be concerns when rumours circulate, these rumours seem to be absolutely unfounded.I wanted to give you some other news because you are particularly interested in the Strasburg-Vienna section. On 31 March, the European Commission published two invitations to submit TEN-T proposals. Within the framework of these proposals, the Strasburg-Vienna section could obtain backing under the 2009 annual programme - amounting to EUR 140 million for both studies and work projects - and the European Economic Recovery Plan, this provides EUR 500 million exclusively earmarked for work projects to be started by the end of 2010 at the latest.It is naturally up to national governments to send in cofinancing proposals, which will be assessed competitively against proposals from other Member States. This means that if Germany intends to submit a plan concerning this section of greatest interest to you, it can go ahead and do this and the plan for obtaining funding will be carefully evaluated by the Commission.As regards the progress of Project 17, the Commission has decided to grant significant funding to various projects along this axis, more specifically the three cross-border sections and the bottlenecks.\nPERSON358 : Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."

"transcript": "PERSON084 : rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, as the debate was not held for technical reasons, allow me to say a couple of words before the vote. Following intensive negotiations with the Council and the Commission, I believe that we achieved a good compromise at first reading. With the contribution made by the European Parliament, we have accelerated the application of the directive by one year, broadened the scope to service stations in residential areas, strengthened information and control mechanisms for service stations and information mechanisms for citizens.This is a change, the application of which will improve the quality of the atmosphere and will considerably limit the greenhouse gases which cause climate change. The Commission has undertaken, at our proposal, to submit a recast proposal after a certain period of time, so that we will have better technology which will allow us to achieve even better results in future.The final compromise is supported by all the political groups and I think that this is a sign that we have done a good job."

"transcript": "PERSON087 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I was given a mandate by the House to enter into negotiations with the other institutions on this important dossier. Sadly, I have to report that the negotiations have not been productive, and therefore I am recommending to the House today that we do not vote and that we refer the decision on this important dossier to the next Parliament, when I expect the Commission to produce a new proposal in the autumn of this year.\nPERSON088 : Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission takes note of the decision of Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman's report until the next parliamentary term. While fully respecting Parliament's decision, the Commission is not convinced that the vote closing Parliament's first reading would tie the hands of the next Parliament. Therefore, the Commission will reconsider its proposal only after the two branches of legislative authority have adopted their positions, but intends to continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with both institutions in the mean time and confirms its willingness to seek a compromise with Parliament and the Council.\nPERSON089 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I think that illustrates why it is extremely important that the next Parliament exercises every single prerogative that it has. A dialogue means that each institution has to listen. So far, neither of the institutions is listening to Parliament. For that reason, we should not take the vote and we should fully empower the next Parliament.(Applause)\nPERSON091 : I am not sure whether congratulations are in order for Mr Cashman. Yes? Then we congratulate him."

"transcript": "PERSON104 : rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very willing to work with me on what is an incredibly technical and difficult dossier. By working together we have been able to come up with what, I believe, is a good compromise.Animal testing is a highly controversial and emotional area which does involve a moral dilemma. We have done our best to create a position which will improve welfare for animals used for testing and, at the same time, ensure that top-quality and reliable medical research can continue within Europe. We have built upon the Commission's proposal in many areas and, most importantly, we have clarified the severity classifications. We had a good compromise in the Agriculture Committee and it should not be picked apart at this stage.We all want to work together to refine, reduce and replace animal testing. However, we must remember that many vaccines and cures for diseases have been developed using animals, and especially primates - for example, vaccines for polio, diphtheria, hepatitis B, along with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. All are examples of the benefits of animal research. To allay concerns that many Members have with the use of embryonic stem cells, Amendment 170, if supported, will ensure that ethical decisions on this issue are made by Member States themselves and not by the Commission.We have a huge opportunity here to improve legislation for animal welfare and research. We should put our party differences aside and support this report. Industry, medical research and animal welfare organisations are convinced that this is a step forward and that we will update and improve the current legislation. If we do not deal with it in this Parliament, the legislation could be put back by a further two years or more, which would be a retrograde step. I urge Members of the House to support this report.Finally, as this is probably the last time I will speak in the Chamber because I am retiring to go into national politics, can I thank you for the courtesy with which you have treated me and thank the Members of the House, who have also treated me with great courtesy.(Applause)\nPERSON105 : Thank you very much, Mr Parish. When you go back to your national Parliament, we wish you the same zest for work that you had here in the European Parliament."

I ask you - and I include the Group here - to bear this in mind.\nPERSON099 : (DE) Mr President, I would like to ask you which article of the Rules of Procedure allows Groups to correct their voting lists here with your consent?

I then gave way to a colleague who retired from Parliament completely two weeks ago.
